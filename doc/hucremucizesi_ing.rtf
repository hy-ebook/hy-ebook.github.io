A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, God's existence
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the last 140 years it h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explaine\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discusse\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hese books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader will\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explana\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tions based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

The subject of this book is the cell, the building block of the human body and of every species of plants and animals. Most people would say that this topic belongs to the realm of bi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ology or even chemistry, reasoning that any treatise about the human cell could only be a biology or a chemistry textbook. However, the book you hold in your hands is no textbook. Its aim is neither to increase your scientific knowledge, nor teach you bio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ogy in detail, because by itself, increased biological knowledge of the cell is of no benefit. And besides, most of the details are taught to students while at school-though most of them forget it all soon after, never to remember it again. Why? Because t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is type of biological information about the cell is presented to students in a completely wrong logical context. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact, young people are infected with this twisted logic right from the beginning of their lives. As soon as a young child starts to observe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the world around him, he's amazed at everything he sees and begins to ask questions. Looking at the Sun, he is awestruck. "How," he asks, "can such a vast ball of fire can stay up there in space, just the right distance away to produce just enough heat a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d light for human beings on Earth? Who put the Sun there? And how? And why?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But in response to this and other similar questions, the answer that the child will probably receive is, "The Sun is a perfectly normal star, and it's been there for billions of y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ears. Moreover, nobody placed it there. It appeared by chance as a result of a big explosion that took place, and the Earth-again by coincidence-formed in just the right spot for human life to exist."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But if this same child was raised in a knowledgeable so\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ciety possessed of a conscience, the answer he received would be quite different: "That the Sun gives us heat and light is a manifestation of God's endless knowledge and perfect creativity. If He had not willed the Sun to exist, we would not have been abl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to live our lives here on Earth. Had the Sun been either closer to, or further from, the Earth, we still couldn't exist. Just like everything else around us, the Sun is a miracle and a mercy from God. It should be a means for us to remember Him and to th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nk Him continuously."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
But as mentioned before, the child seldom gets this kind of response and his curiosity is put to sleep with strictly "scientific" logic. Meeting with this type of answer to his every question, finally he learns not to be amazed at any
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thing and to overlook the extraordinariness of all things. When he first eats a tasty apple, he asks, "How is it that trees present such beautiful and beneficial things to man?" In all probability he will receive the same predictable answer: "Trees have b

 behind all creatures and all events. Then, when he gets a bit older, physics, biology and chemistry lessons teach him about the workings of the human body or nature, but he is made to believe that all of this is just natural and not miraculo

he learns the biological details of how fruit develops on trees. He is loaded up with facts about photosynthesis and plant structure. But all the while, questions like the following are never asked or answered: "How could such a perfect nutrient, presente

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . And at this point, the last stop in his education, the theory of evolution finally arrives on the scene.

Before examining the extraordinary human cell, it's a good idea to consider the faulty logic behind the theory of evolution. Like \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
every long-standing deception, it has been carefully prepared, but within, it possesses discrepancies of logic. We can explain this mentality of evolutionary theory, composed of complete fraudulent and deceitful scenarios, with an analogy:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consider a remot\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e-controlled toy car. Assume that the person holding the remote control is hiding nearby. Another person observing this car will see its movements only, because he cannot perceive the remote control or whoever is controlling it. He watches the car perform
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng quite intelligent feats, turning according to the path it's on and making apparently conscious movements. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this point, if the observer's principle is to believe only what he perceives, then he will accept as real only the world he sees around him. He\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 will reject the possibility of another location that he cannot see or that to which he has no access. He won't accept that there is an intelligent mind who he can't see or hear, and that the car moves under this person's command. And so, the person is le
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t to think that the car gained its ability to move about in so intelligent a manner as a result of a series of coincidences-and he will then try to convince himself and everyone around him of this explanation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His next step will be to develop fictitious t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
heories under the guise of science to support this "belief," but which have no intelligent basis. With a little imagination, the problem is solved, however unlikely the whole scenario: The atoms that compose the car came together "coincidentally" to form 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his complex mechanical structure. As a result of their coming together accidentally and assembling into a complicated, functional structure, the car also "evolved" such abstract qualities as the ability to think, make decisions, and move about intelligent
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y by itself. Thus is put forth a theory that explains the car.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In a short time, this "scientist" finds others who think like him. Together, they develop this theory further and establish a "forum" from which they propose a new branch of science. They then \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
begin a scientific analysis of the car's movements and develop various formulas. How much does the car slow when it approaches a curve, and at what angle does it turn? Under what conditions does it speed up, and how fast does it go? Under what conditions 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oes it slow down or stop? When does it reverse? They meticulously measure these and many other similar characteristics and make calculations. They then write a book detailing all these measurements and calculations.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But their actual problem lies in explain\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing how the car came to be able to carry out such perfect actions all by itself. And none of the analyses and research carried out by these so-called "scientists" can answers that question. They may have described innumerable features about the car's tech
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ical aspects and details, and are coming up with more findings every day. But as yet, they haven't made the slightest advance in understanding the radio-car's manufacture, and thus are no better off than when they first started: Who made the car? How did

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The "scientists" reply by avoiding and disguising these questions. To begin with, they try their best to prevent them from arising in the first place. When questions do come\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 up, they give a very "scientific" explanation: "Maybe we don't have any evidence that holds up right now, but surely answers will be found in the future."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory that the car came about by itself is so entrenched and elaborated that by now, it has bec\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ome the foundation of these scientists' careers. For this reason, they try their hardest to keep the theory credible, whatever the cost. If need be, they'll even resort to deceit and trickery to keep the theory from losing credibility and to stop people f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 om considering other possibilities. But of course, any such dishonesty should be overlooked in the cause of advancing such a "sublime" goal.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These books are written very cleverly, in that they contain some accurate technical details which have been discove\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
red about the car. With a little imagery and a few plays on words, one gets the impression that it does, in fact, answer the question of how the car came into existence and how it came about to possess its apparent intelligence. And here is the important 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oint: By interspersing all this nonsense about "chance" and "coincidence" with these complicated formulas and calculations about how the car came about, one is left with the impression that the nonsense too is scientific fact. In this way, a false and dec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ying theory, which has now become an ideology, is established with skilful and artful deceit, and interspersed with some facts that are wholly correct, yet do not bring one any closer to the truth. Moreover, care is taken to choose a tone of the utmost se
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f-confidence and superiority, and which instills trust. In this way, various falsehoods proposed by this theory are taken to have been scientifically proven. Now that the lie has a so-called foundation, it takes only a strong imagination to create unlimit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d but fantastic scenarios based on it. Meanwhile, the car has already taken its place in the "evolutionary tree," and this amazing object-actually created by a superior engineer-is proclaimed to be the result of a chain of miraculous "coincidences." Of co
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rse the car is given a Latinized name, just to further enhance the "scientific" flavor.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We should admit that all the calculations made about the car's movements may in fact be true. However, the logical basis and foundation on which t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hese measurements rest-that is, that the car came into being by itself and that it moves by making intelligent decisions-is faulty from the start. But a large segment of the population is unaware of the fine processes involved. Even the briefest explanati
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ns are enough to make believe illogical claims, because they are told by "an esteemed scientist." Of course, this scientist is going to be "smarter" than them and will know more, for which reason, they assume that everything the scientist says is true. Wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tever he says and however he thinks must be correct. Different techniques-psychological methods-are used for those with a higher level of education, who recognize the scientific fraud lying beneath the deceit, to make them digest it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This type of psycholog\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ical pressure and inculcation, influencing people's subconscious and directing them to a desired way of thinking, is one of the most important aspects of the plan that defends the theory. By adopting and defending the opinions of these so-called "scientis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s," a person is considered to be up-to-date, knowledgeable, and progressive. If anyone objects to or rejects the theory, he is addressed in quite condescending terms such as unfashionable, fanatical, and backward. Thus, people lacking the courage to risk 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eing stigmatized and slandered in this way are prevented from reacting unfavorably to this theory and becoming a problem. The result is an effective process of indoctrination, consisting of audaciously fabricated lies and deceit and scenarios which are wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lly imaginary, endless fantasies and frauds, deception and illusions, socio-psychological methods of subconscious suppression, plus a variety of other methods of brainwashing-all with the appropriate logistical support from the media and academia. And mos
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  people do fall under the influence of this indoctrination.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, anyone with only a little intelligence can free himself from the effects of this spell. To unprejudiced eyes, this pompous "theory" developed to explain how the car moves is nothing but n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
onsense. Because the car is in the hands of an unseen controller, and is not doing anything other than moving according to the commands given to it. And the way to arrive at this conclusion is not through science, but through intelligent consciousness. As
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
we mentioned before, science can analyze only the movements of the car; and once it has carried out this analysis, its job is done. Science is not a guide, only a means. And the way to understanding that the toy car has no mind of its own, but that a grea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er mind manifests in the car, is via intelligence and conscience. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 And so if people are devoid of these qualities, no matter the number of universities from which they may have graduated, regardless of whether they've reached the pinnacle of their academic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 careers and have dedicated their lives to science, they can descend to such a comically pitiful state that they cannot perceive such an evidently plain truth. They waste their whole lives in the struggle to find intricate but erroneous explanations for e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ents.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This is similar to a man who remains unaware of the Sun because he never lifts up his head. He then travels his whole life, constructing thousands of incongruous theories to explain why the world is illumined for some hours, and then becomes shrouded
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in darkness. He will hit on any number of complicated theories, all in accord with his degree of cleverness. To find the source of the light, he will make detailed extraordinary links between the objects found on Earth and everyday processes. But since h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  doesn't have enough intelligence, he won't be able to witness the existence of the Sun up in the sky and will not be able to perceive such a plain truth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His situation is not far different to that of someone who doesn't understand that the whole universe \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in which he lives and all of the components of this universe were created by God and are regulated by Him. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Why cannot these people comprehend such a clear and evident truth?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The secret of this is given to us in the Qur'an: Cleverness is not enough to comp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rehend the true nature of the universe in which we live; we also need wisdom. Only to the degree that a person possesses true wisdom can he arrive at accurate and firm conclusions as a result of what is transmitted to his intellect and attain to fundament
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l truths. Intellect is a function of the brain; whereas as is explained in the Qur'an, wisdom is a function of the heart. If a person's heart has become hardened and calloused, he will not be able to understand and therefore, will not succeed in reaching 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 G\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
od via the things he sees around him. And because he will not have perceived the purpose of his being created, he will only be in the position of an animal slightly smarter than the other animals. He will continue his life like an animal, a creature that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oes not think or comprehend. The Qur'an speaks of these people whose hearts have become rusted-that is, who have become bereft of conscience and common sense-with the following words:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Whenever we examine with a microscope the details of any human organ, we see millions of tiny living entities that have massed together to form that organ and which at every in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
stant are in constant activity. Not just human beings, but all living organisms are formed from aggregates of these tiny microscopic entities called cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Cells are divided into two types: those without a nucleus (prokaryotes) and those that do possess a \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nucleus (eukaryotes). Bacteria are single-celled organisms that lack a nucleus. Every human, animal and plant cell does contain a nucleus, but they have a different structure. Using the energy from the Sun, with the aid of the chloroplasts found in their 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ells, plants produce nutrients and oxygen for humans and animals. This book focuses mainly on the human cell, but will touch on plant cells from time to time.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  evolution of organisms.1}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another admission on this topic belongs to Professor Klaus Dose, the Director of the Institute for Biochemistry at Johannes Gutenburg University. In regard to the formation of the living cell, Dose has this to say:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In spite of ma\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ny attempts, there have been no breakthroughs during the past 30 years to help to explain the origin of chilarity in living cells.2}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 With these words Dose admits that evolution cannot explain the origins of living things.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 From these admissions, it is quite\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 clear that evolutionary theory stumbles right from its first step and has no possibility of going any further. Because, as is known, the living organism's basic unit is the cell. Consequently a theory that cannot explain how the cell came into being-or, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ven how the proteins that make up the cell, or how the amino acids that make up the protein came into being-is in no way able to explain how all living beings on Earth were formed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On the contrary, the cell is one of the m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ost dazzling proofs that the human being was, in fact, created. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For the cell to continue its existence, all of the components that carry out the vital processes need to be assembled together in one place. Anyone who claims that the cell came about as a re\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sult of so-called evolutionary changes is actually asserting that the millions of different components making up the cell formed at the same time and in the same place-by coincidence. Moreover, all of these parts needed to have come together in a particul
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r order and plan. It's undoubtedly impossible that such an event could have come about by chance. Therefore, a structure like the cell is a clear proof of creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can illustrate this with an analogy: The possibility that the cell arose through a serie\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s of coincidences, as the theory of evolution proposes, is less likely than if a bomb were to explode in a printing house and an encyclopedia was published as a result. In other words, a living organism coming into being by coincidence is beyond the limit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of possibility.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Despite this, evolutionists are still claiming that living things came about by coincidence under the primitive earth conditions, which was then the most uncontrolled of environments. But under no circumstances can this claim ever conform 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to scientific fact. Even the most basic calculations have proven mathematically that, not only the cell, but even just one of the millions of proteins that compose it, cannot have come into existence as a result of coincidence. This shows that evolutionar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  theory is based not on intelligent logic, but rather on a collection of imaginary and fantastic scenarios. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Equally amazing as the formation of a single cell is the perfect harmony and cooperation amongst cells. All of the myriad cells in the human body c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ame about as a result of the division-and subsequent multiplication-of just one cell. And right from the start, all of the knowledge to shape the structure of our bodies as they are now, their design and all of their features were present in the chromosom
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s located in the nucleus of that very first cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All cells resemble one another in their general features. However, each organ possesses cells that are different from any other organ's. Cells have been bestowed with specialized shapes and abilities, depe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nding on the structure and duty of the organ they compose.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One single cell possesses a complexity akin to a large city's in terms of its systems and communication, its transport and management. Just a few of the complex structures found in the cell include\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 powerhouses that produce energy for the cell's use; factories that manufacture enzymes and hormones vital to the cell's existence; a knowledge bank containing all the information needed to manufacture all the products that the cell will produce; a comple

 transport system and roadways that transfer raw materials and products from one site to another; a laboratory and refinery that can distinguish and separate raw materials coming in from outside; specialized membrane proteins that control the entry and ex
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t of the materials. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Any human's continued existence occurs as a result of the harmonious cooperation within and amongst the cells that make up the body. The cell works in great harmony with others, while maintaining its own existence within a sensitive ba
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lance. By itself, it determines and then produces the materials and energy it needs to maintain this inner balance. Whenever it cannot meet some of its requirements itself, it meticulously selects the necessary materials from outside. It is so selective t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
at without its "permission," no substance, even one found in abundance outside the cell, can accidentally enter through its membrane. There is never to be found an unnecessary molecule or one that doesn't have a purpose in the cell. All substances leaving
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the cell are under the same tight controls and strict regulations.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition to all this, the cell possesses a defense system to protect it from external threats and attacks. Yet despite the number of structures and systems contained within it, and the e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ndless activity that takes place, the average size of a cell is measured not in square kilometers like a modern city, but in only hundredths of a millimeter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All these amazing processes, which we have mentioned briefly and which we will analyze separately \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in the rest of the book, take place in such a tiny living thing. That is a miracle in itself.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You would have to accept that any single cell i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n your stomach or your ear is more knowledgeable than you. And because it evaluates its information in the most correct and perfect way, it must also be more intelligent than you.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So what is the source of this intelligence? How does each and every one of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he 100 trillion cells in your body possess such incredible intelligence? After all, a cell is just a collection of organic molecules, with no consciousness. Even if you joined together the atoms of all of the elements, in different numbers and permutation

 take place within the cell? The answer is very simple: Intelligence is not to be found within these molecules or within the cell itself, but in the One Who created the molecules and programmed them to carry out these processes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, intelligence lies\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 not in the product itself, but in that product's Creator. Even the most advanced computer is the result of an intellect who has written the program that will run the computer, down to the most minute detail. In the same way, the DNA and the RNA found ins

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So why not ask the same questions about the cell? If somebody wrote the information on the disc in our example, then who created DNA so perfectly, which is much more superior and more highly advanced; and then placed it 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
carefully in a tiny cell-which is a miracle by itself-without losing any of its characteristics, from thousands of years ago until today? (Never forget, the human brain that manufactured the disc and programmed the instructions inside it is composed of th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 se same cells we are talking about).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What more important questions could there be than who created the cell and why? These cells are on constant duty to let you read these lines, see, breathe, think, in short exist and continue your existence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The answer t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Could anyone claim that these words were not written by a conscious, literate soldier, but that they just appeared there by coincidence? Could anyone say that as the stones rolled down the hill, they randomly formed such

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
What if a scientist were to declare, "There are trillions of stones in the world, and they have been rolling around for millions of years. Therefore, it is possible that some of these stones could come together at random to form meaningful sen

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s no chance that even a neat letter could be formed by happenstance. Even if you saw merely that first capital written neatly atop a hill, you would wonder why somebody wrote it there.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The human body, however, has a structure a trillion times more complex than any sentence spelled out in rocks, and there is absolutely no chance that this \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Mathematically, there is no chance for coincidence in the formation of DNA's encoded information. The possibility that even one of the 200,000 genes found in DNA could have come abou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t by chance-let alone the DNA molecule itself, made up of millions of sections-has been completely invalidated. An evolutionary biologist, Frank B. Salisbury, has this to say:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A medium protein might include about 300 amino acids. The DNA gene controlling t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his would have about 1,000 nucleotides in its chain. Since there are four kinds of nucleotides in a DNA chain, one consisting of 1,000 links could exist in 41000 forms. Using a little algebra (logarithms) we can see that 41000=10600. Ten multiplied by its
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lf 600 times gives the figure 1 followed by 600 zeros! This number is completely beyond our comprehension.4 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even if we assume that the surrounding environment contains all of the necessary nucleotides, plus the complex molecules and binding enzymes needed\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to connect them together, the probability that these nucleotides will ever bind together in the desired order is 1 in 41000-or in other words, 1 in 10600. In short, the possibility of an average human protein coming about by itself, is 1 out of a number 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
esulting from putting a 1 followed by 600 zeros. This number, beyond astronomical in practical terms, means zero probability. Such an arrangement could therefore have come about only under the control and knowledge of an intelligent and conscious power, w

would you say? Obviously, you would find such a claim highly illogical, and reply that this sentence definitely originated from one who was most intelligent and knowledgeable. And the case of DNA is no different.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Francis Crick is the biochemist who co-disc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
overed the structure of DNA, and won the Nobel Prize for his work in this area. At first a persistent evolutionist, Crick wrote the following after he witnessed DNA's miraculous structure:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uld only state that, in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle.5 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 According to Crick, life could never have appeared on this Earth by chance. So even one of the greatest specialists in DNA, and an evolutionist to boot, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gives no credence to the notion of coincidence in creation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The information in DNA, comprised from five billion bases, comes about as a result of the unique and meaningful order of the A, T, G and C letters. But not a single mistake can be made in this or\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
der. In an encyclopedia, a mistyped word or letter isn't too important and can be ignored. It may not even be noticed. In contrast, an error in any rung of the DNA ladder-for example, a mistake in the coding of one letter in the 1, 719, 348, 632nd rung-re

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To be accurate, we shouldn't really say a mistake in coding. Just like everything el\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Cells multiply by dividing. Thus a human body starts out as a single cell, which then divides to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 form two and then 4, 6, 8, 16, 32 cells and so on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But after this process of division, what happens to DNA? Any one cell contains only one helix of DNA. But clearly, the newly divided cells will each need their own DNA. To overcome this problem a new serie
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s of processes takes place, each step of which is a miracle in itself. Just before the cell divides, its DNA is replicated, so that each new cell receives an exact copy of the original. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Microscopic observations reveal that before the cell divides, it must\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 reach a certain size. Once it does, the process of division is initiated. As the cell begins to widen into the shape required for division, the DNA starts to replicate itself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
What this means is that the cell as a whole "decides" to divide, and its different parts begin to act accordingly. Clearly, the cell doesn't possess the knowledge to carry out such a cooperative process successfully. The process of division starts with a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ilent command, and with the DNA leading the way, the rest of the cell follows suit.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to replicate itself, DNA first separates into two opposite strands-an event that takes place in a very interesting manner. The DNA molecule resembles a spiral ladd\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er, whose rungs open up like a zipper. The DNA now separates into two strands, and each of the two opposite, incomplete strands then completes itself with materials found in the cellular environment. In this way are produced, two new DNA molecules. At eac
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 stage of the process, specialized proteins called enzymes, operating like highly advanced robots, carry out their respective duties. To explain the process completely would take many pages, since what seems a very simple procedure at first glance is actu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lly made up of innumerable steps that are highly complex.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The new DNA molecule resulting from this pairing is checked over and over again by control enzymes. If there is a mistake-and any mistakes could prove fatal-it is quickly identified and repaired. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e faulty segment is removed and a corrected one brought and put into place. All of these processes occur at dizzying speeds. For example 3,000 base pairs are produced every minute, while each rung of the ladder is gone over by enzymes on duty and then rep
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ired, if need be.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
External factors can cause mistakes to occur at a higher rate than normal in the synthesis of the new DNA molecule. In this case, ribosomes in the cell begin to manufacture repair enzymes according to the command given by the DNA. In this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  way, the DNA is protected, and the next generation of cells is preserved. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Cells, just like the human beings they make up, are born, multiply and die. But the life span of the cell is much shorter. For instance, most of the cells that made up your body si\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
x months ago are no longer alive today. You still exist because those old cells divided and left new cells to take their place. For human life to continue, it's vitally important that such processes as the multiplication of cells and the copying of the DN
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 be carried out flawlessly. In fact, the replication process takes place so perfectly that the rate of error is only one base pair in 3 billion. And before it can cause the body any problems, this single mistake is fixed by control mechanisms of a higher 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rder. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
So all day, without your even knowing it, innumerable processes, controls, and precautions take place in your body with astonishing meticulousness and sense of responsibility to keep you alive without any problems. God has provided you with innumera
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ble atoms and molecules, from the tiniest to the largest, from the simplest to the most complex, so that you can live your life in the most healthy fashion. Isn't this favor and blessing alone enough to make man continuously grateful? Or must people wait 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 or a problem to arise in this faultless system, before they come to their senses?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Most interesting is that the enzymes facilitating the production of DNA and the regulation of its structure are all encoded within the DNA itself. In fact, they are proteins \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
synthesized under the DNA's command and control. This system is so amazingly intricate that it's absolutely impossible for it to have arisen by a series of coincidental steps. Because in order for the enzyme to exist, the DNA must exist, but in order for 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he DNA to exist, so must the enzymes. And for both of them to exist, the cell must exist in its entirety, from the cell membrane inward to all its complex organelles.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution proposes that organisms developed "step by step" as a result of "\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
beneficial coincidences." But this DNA-enzyme paradox absolutely refutes it, since both the DNA and the enzymes must be in existence at the same time. This is blatant evidence of God's existence. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

Another point worth noting is that for mutations to be passed on to future generations, they must arise in the generative cells. Any change in the body cells or organs alone will not be passed along. For example, if a woman loses her finger

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e fully, let's remember that the cell's organizational setup for protein production can be compared to a giant factory that can manufacture hundreds of different products all at the same time. Obviously, no factory on Earth can perfectly manufacture such 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  wide range of products. In order to understand the cell's perfect production methods, we can imagine a science-fiction model factory that possesses similar features and abilities. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such a theoretical factory would work as follows: An external command arri\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ves at the factory, and the decision is made to manufacture (for instance) a fighter plane. The plane's technical details are stored in the factory's computer, along with all its other measurements and specifications. The computer presents all these calcu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ations and measurements into a plan that the production-and-assembly robots can understand, and sends these plans to them by special transport systems.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Carefully, the assembly system begins to manufacture the plane. Its every part is brought by an assembly\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 robot responsible solely for that particular piece and then is assembled in the correct location. The smallest error will later result in the plane falling out of the sky; but the system makes no mistake. On the rare occasion a defective product is produ
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed, it passes through sensitive quality-control checkpoints and is removed from the assembly line, whereupon the defective product is disassembled and its parts are used for new products. Nothing is wasted. At the same time, the factory is able to produce
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hundreds of other products such as dialysis machines, computers, and cars. Some of these products it uses for itself, and others it exports outside.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The cell's organization is actually much more perfect than this science-fiction analogy suggests. As mentio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ned before, the human body uses more than 200,000 different types of proteins, and all of these are synthesized in the cell. The plans for all of these proteins are also found in the cell. But the cell selects from its DNA only the information needed to m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ke the proteins it will use for itself or it will export outside, and then makes only these proteins. The functional differences between the proteins it produces are at least as great as the differences between those of a plane and a television.

beyond the limits of what the mind can conceive. But they do leave us facing some important questions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The first has to do with the beginnings of protein synthesis. How does a cell-which cannot be seen with the naked eye, formed from mindless molecules-mak\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e the decision to start producing something? The ability to decide, think, and evaluate is a feature of conscious living things. Obviously, unconscious molecules of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen atoms don't possess the ability to make decisions. T
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ere must be another power inspiring the cell to make these decisions and then directing it accordingly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once a decision is made, the next step is for the messenger RNA to read the instructions encoded within the DNA. The enzyme responsible for producing R\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
NA finds in the DNA only the instructions needed for the desired protein-but in reality, the process is extremely difficult. Finding the relevant information in the DNA means locating and extracting an instruction consisting of 900 base pairs from a store
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of 5 billion. This is like trying to find one particular sentence in a 20-volume encyclopedia, without any help. However this problem has been made easy in an awe-inspiring way: The relevant portion of the DNA has been marked by "start" and "stop" labels 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hat the enzyme can find.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Who has placed these labels, understood only by enzymes, in the relevant places? Who gave these enzymes the ability to recognize these labels? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The undoubted answer to these questions is clear: the One Who made these faultless syst\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ems and the One Who placed every detail where it needs to be, and Who has allowed all of this to proceed in harmony is the Creator of all living things, God, the Possessor of infinite knowledge.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l ladder. During the replication stage, the rungs of the ladder need to open up so that their information can be read, and this is done by an enzyme. This unwinding process is so fast that friction might cause the DNA molecule to heat up and disintegrate.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
But this danger is overcome by precautions that have been taken beforehand. A special enzyme holds both sides of the helix apart, preventing any friction. Again with the help of special enzymes, the DNA molecule is prevented from getting tangled and messe

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Remember, the enzymes that carry out such complicated and difficult tasks are just proteins themselves, also produced by the same method: protein synthesis inside the cell. In order for this production to be carr

During the copying of DNA by RNA in some cells, amazing events take place. The enzyme that produces RNA reads and copies the code in the DNA relevant to the protein it will produce, but it sometimes runs across codes that aren't needed for this prod
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uction. Because during replication, the enzyme reads the DNA fragments in order, it has to read the irrelevant instructions as well. But remember, even one irrelevant instruction can render an entire synthesized protein completely worthless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let's examine \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in more detail the problem this enzyme encounters. Say a protein of 1,000 amino acids is to be produced. If each amino acid is represented by three bases (a codon), then in order to perform this duty, the enzyme needs to read a 3,000 base pair DNA sequenc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
-in order. But within this 3,000-base pair sequence is a complete sequence of say 500 base pairs for which the enzyme has no need. But in order to reach the instructions that follow, the enzyme cannot just skip over these 500 base pairs without copying th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m. It must copy them whether it wants to or not. The enzyme cannot cut the giant DNA molecule, nor can it skip over it. What would you-a human being, possessed of intellect-do to solve this problem?

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In recent years, scientists have observed the fascinating\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 way in which this problem is solved. The DNA molecule, made up of simple materials like phosphate, sugar, and carbon, acts in a way which leaves one dumbfounded. The unwanted sequence, called an }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

In this way, the ends of the codons that need to be read one after the other, but which are separated by irrelevant information, are brought together. The regions containing the necessary information are called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

A second method is used to prevent the problem of the introns. The RNA first copies the entire DNA molecule from start to finish, including the irrelevant sequences. Later on, as if obeying a command, it coils out the unnecessary sequences in loops, which

As a result of the processes enumerated in the previous section, the instructions needed f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

How does evolutionary theory explain how proteins, the first stage of life, were first formed?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The answer is simple: it cannot. The evolutionists' claim is nothing more than that proteins came about by chance, as a result of a series of coincidences. Examining their claim's inconsistency, we can see how strikingly deceitful evolution really is.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  negative factors present on that primitive planet? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What's more, it's not enough for just this one protein to have formed itself. In this wildly uncontrolled environment, it had to wait for another protein molecule to form just like itself-by coincidence 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
under the same conditions-without anything destroying it in the meantime. This had to occur again and again until at last, millions of appropriate and necessary proteins had come together "coincidentally" in the same place to form the cell. The very first
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
proteins that formed had to wait patiently for thousands and millions of years for other proteins to form right next to them-without being destroyed in the meantime despite ultraviolet radiation and a harsh environment. Then these proteins, assumed to hav
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 formed by coincidence in enough numbers and in the same place, had to have come together in a meaningful way to form the organelles in the cell. No foreign substance, harmful molecule, or useless protein should have been incorporated into the chain. Thes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 organelles had to come together in the most organized fashion, with all the necessary enzymes, and had to have been surrounded by a membrane, containing a special fluid that constituted the most ideal environment. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But even if all of these implausible eve\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nts took place, the pile of molecules that resulted still would not have come to life. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Research has shown that the mere coming together of substances necessary for living things is not sufficient enough for life to come about. Even if all of the proteins \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
needed for life were placed in a test tube, they still wouldn't result in a living being, because life is much more than just a few molecules being found together.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution cannot explain how the necessary substances for life formed, nor how they cam\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e together, nor how life first started.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let's for a moment accept all of these impossibilities: that billions of years ago, all of the substances needed for life came together as a living entity. Alas, the theory of evolution is still destined to collapse!
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Even if the cell became alive, eventually it would have died. There would have been nothing left, and we would have been back where we started. Because this first living had no genetic system in place, cell would have died not having been able to replica
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e itself and therefore, could not have left behind a new generation. Life would have expired along with the cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The genetic system is not made up of just DNA. Vital components include enzymes that read the code in the DNA, the production of mRNA from th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e reading of this code, ribosomes upon which the mRNA with its codons binds, the tRNAs that carry to the ribosomes the amino acids to be used in production, and innumerable other complex enzymes that facilitate these processes. All had to be found in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ame environment-which, moreover, had to have been completely isolated and controlled. Only in the cell itself are found all of the needed raw materials and energy sources. Consequently, an organic substance can replicate itself only if there first exists 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  completely functional cell with all its organelles in place. This means that the cell, with its all incredibly complex structure, was created in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But for a complex structure to come into being instantaneously, what are the implications?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We ca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n compare the cell's complexity to that of a highly developed car (even though the cell actually constitutes a much more complex and highly developed system). Now, suppose you went for a walk through an untouched forest one day and found the latest model 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ar among the trees. All the raw materials making up the car-iron, plastic, rubber, etc.-are made from substances that occur naturally. But would you believe that such a sophisticated, user-friendly machine came about as a result of the coincidental coming
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 together of different elements in the forest over millions of years? Would you think that these various substances were also made coincidentally, and then came together to make such a car? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Of course, you know that any car is the product of conscious desig\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n-by engineers working in a factory. And you would wonder what it was doing in the middle of a forest. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For such a complex structure as the cell to come into being in one instant indicates that it was created by a conscious Being. The probability that one \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
useful, meaningful protein could come about by chance is zero, so how impossible is the coming together of millions of these various proteins to form a cell? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, this chain of impossibilities does not end there. Even if the millions of proteins need\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed came about by coincidence and gathered at the same point, this is still the equivalent of simply heaping bricks and cement onto a site where a sophisticated skyscraper is to be built. Only with a plan of utmost complexity, after the most sensitive meas

The living cell possesses the most complex structure the scientific world has ever come across. Even the single cell of tiny prokaryotic bacterium-the simplest organism capable of living as a separate entity-has developed such complexity that the technolo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y of a space shuttle is simple by comparison. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To accept the impossible, suppose that the cell did form coincidentally and then let's consider the plausibility of this supposition. In this situation, most of the innumerable objects and tools we see around 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
us, which are much simpler in structure than the cell, would have to have been formed a thousand times easier than the cell. According to the rules of simple logic, the formation of a less complex object by chance is much easier than the formation of a mo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e complex object by chance. If this highly complex structure could have formed on its own, then simpler ones in the same environment would have to have formed much more easily and in greater numbers. Consequently, if we accept for a second that coincidenc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s have the power to create, then the probability that a television, a car, a microchip or a walkman could form at random, with no creative mind, in a primitive environment, is much higher than a cell theoretically forming by chance. (Without a doubt, in r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ality, the possibility that these formed by coincidence is zero, and this is a solely imaginary example, the cell included).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consider another discrepancy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For a living cell to form, multiply, and continue the next generation, the proteins making up a majo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r part of the cell's components and the DNA that facilitates genetic transmission must have been found together at the same time. If all the proteins and enzymes, organelles, cell membrane, and DNA all came together at random, even this is not enough to f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rm a cell because of one great danger: DNA can in no way come into contact with these proteins since DNA is acidic, and proteins are bases. Whenever they come in contact, they will immediately react and neutralize each other. Even if the DNA nucleotides a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d the proteins came together in the "primitive soup"-the imaginary environment so named by evolutionists-they would have destroyed each other and never moved on to the next step.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another miraculous aspect is that although an acid and a base naturally react\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 together when brought in contact, in the cell these two substances display perfect cooperation and work together in harmony to facilitate production-yet their coming together freely outside of the cell spells destruction for both of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As always, this\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 system has been planned in great detail, with all manner of precaution. The DNA has been placed in the nucleus, the safest of all places in the cell, and isolated by very sensitive and special means from surrounding structures that might harm it. During 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he DNA replication process, contact between the DNA and the enzyme proteins occurs in such a controlled and measured manner that no molecule is damaged, and both substances enjoy the highest productivity.

Up to now, we have explained just a few of the miracles that take place in the cell and in the human body. Anyone with a conscience can perceive the perfection in the creation of his own body and by thus knowing God's handiwork, can grow closer to Him.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consider th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at billions of these processes are going on at every second, and you can more clearly understand that complexity of this system within the body is beyond our comprehension. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Twenty different types of amino acids found in nature are used in protein structur\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e. Actually, depending on the number used and their order, an infinite number of proteins can be made from only these 20 different amino acids. If you compare any protein to a chain, amino acids are the links in the chain. The number of amino acids in dif
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erent protein types within living things is between 100 and 3,000. Random removal, addition, or changing of the order of just one amino acid in the chain would render the protein completely useless, and in fact harmful.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Along with the location and number o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f amino acids, the three- dimensional geometry of the protein they form is also extremely important. It's not enough for the amino acids to be of the right number and in the right place, they also need to fold at certain points to form a shape that lets t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e protein carry out its duty. To allow these folds to take place, amino acids located at sites to be folded are joined by much weaker bonds, which facilitates folding at the right angle. If this weren't so and all amino acid bonds were of equal strength, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he protein formed would be straight, without function-in fact, useless. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, a protein's three-dimensional shape is highly important. Only because of their 3-D shape can enzymes in particular direct, regulate, and accelerate many reactions. Even if t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he protein possessed the right number of amino acids in the correct order, its lack of correct geometric shape would render it useless. In order to facilitate folding, the bonds of attraction between amino acids need to be individually regulated with incr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 dible control and sensitivity. Even the slightest detail must be determined with care.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Since the formation of even one protein molecule requires so many processes and controls, today's technology has not been able to synthesize a protein molecule under lab\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oratory conditions. Yet evolutionists, with their usual insensitivity and blindness, claim that such a molecule came about in the primitive atmosphere as a result of coincidences.

Many complex events take place in our bodies every second. So detailed are they, that at every step, their complex reactions \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 need to be regulated by }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 to bring about order: the enzymes. In every living cell, hundreds of enzymes are found, each with its own special duty: breakdown of nutrients, production of energy from nutrients, production of macromolecular chains\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 from simple molecules, and innumerable other similar processes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Enzymes play a vital role in all cellular functions, from protein synthesis to energy production. If not for these enzymes, not one of your bodily functions, from the simplest to the most co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mplex, would operate; or else they would slow down and stop altogether. You would not be able to breathe, eat or digest anything, see, or speak. The result in either case would be death. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can compare enzymes' speeding-up of body processes to an example \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
from everyday life. The few seconds' time it takes to read a sentence under normal circumstances would, without any enzymes, take ten years. The enzymes that play a role in bodily reactions are at least as rapid as this example. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The relationship between a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n enzyme and the substance it affects is like that between a lock and key. An enzyme and the substance it binds to, join together in a complex three-dimensional manner. Each has been created to fit the other in the most appropriate ways. What's more, this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 harmony comes about at a speed so dizzying that in one second, one enzyme can bind to 300 substances, one after the after, changing each one into the desired form and then separating from it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, cells live thanks to enzymes, and each cell produces t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he enzymes it needs for itself, in the required amounts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of this should cause an intelligent person to ask how it is that a cell can tell when a substance is needed and calculate its requirements? Does the cell itself design these enzymes that work fas\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Clearly, a person of intelligence would come to the conclusion that none of this can be th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Multicellular organisms like animals and humans are composed of cells that have different structures and functions. The body depends on these cells' complex yet highly cooperative functions. The 100 trillion\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cells in the human body work together as if they all know each other. To the end, they carry out the functions assigned to them without any neglect or laziness. And within this perfect coordination are messenger chemicals called hormones, whose function 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s to carry orders between cells. The growth and internal balance of the body, control of reproduction, coordination of the nervous system, and many other processes are realized because of the messages carried by hormones to the relevant cells. Without you
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 even knowing it, a superb command system is at work, as an unseen intelligence sends its orders to cells throughout your body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This superior intelligence keeps everything under control without you even knowing it. You do not have any say in this system. Fo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r instance, you cannot make your body grow as much as you want, no matter how much you may wish so. Whatever you do, you cannot order your cells to divide, multiply and make you grow. Only your cells know the pre-determined height and shape for your body.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 They will multiply until they reach that target and then stop growing, at just the right time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Cells cannot, of course, carry these out through their own intelligence and will. God inspires this flawless chain of commands in them and enables them to carry\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  out their duties to perfection.

For life to continue, the amount of sugar in the human body needs to stay within certain limits. But when you eat nutrients containing sugar, obviously you cannot control this sensitive balance. This con\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
trol is made on your behalf. When your level of blood sugar rises, an organ called the pancreas secretes a special substance called insulin, which orders the cells of the liver and elsewhere in the body to take up sugar from the blood and store it. In thi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  way, blood sugar does not reach dangerous levels. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let's do an experiment. Command all of the cells in your body, the liver cells in particular, to take up the sugar from your blood and start to store it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Forget controlling them. This is impossible, of co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 urse.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
You aren't even aware of your pancreas, your insulin, or your liver. You don't even realize that your blood sugar level has gone up. In fact, if two tubes of blood with differing levels of sugar were placed in front of you, you wouldn't be able to te
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ll the difference between them. For this, you would need a laboratory with highly developed instruments. But some cells in your body, which you never see or know about, measure your blood sugar level with a higher degree of sensitivity than the instrument
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in a laboratory, and decide what needs to be done. Then they take the necessary measures, isolating the sugar in the blood and removing it. Thanks to this perfect system, someone who could eat a piece of cake, fall into a sugar coma and die, is made to l
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ve. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So whom do we have to thank for this perfect system? As always, evolutionists claim that this system came about as a result of a series of coincidences.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But on the basis of logic and reason, it is not possible to accept this claim. As with other evolu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tionists' claims, this one too is nonsense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolution proposes that the human body reached its present day form over millions of years. This means that at some stage, some organs in the human body were not around but later evolved. In that case, we have to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  assume that the pancreas, which controls the level of sugar in the blood and the insulin it secretes, "evolved" over stages.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, this is defective logic, because a person with neither a pancreas nor insulin wouldn't have been able to live. Let's imag\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ine that millions of years ago, there were half-human beings without a pancreas who walked the Earth. They would have eaten large amounts of the first source of sugar they found (sugar cane, for example), gone into a sugar coma and died on the spot. The s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 me thing would have happened to all others like them: They would have died from a sugar coma, but without knowing the reason.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let's assume that some of them stayed alive by strictly controlling their diets. (Though this is not really possible, because ther\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e is sugar in practically everything we eat.) This leaves us with the following question: How did these "ancestors of human beings" come to possess a pancreas and insulin? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Did one of them say one day, "You know, this sugar problem needs to be solved! The \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
best thing to do is place an organ underneath the stomach that will secrete a hormone to balance the level of sugar in our blood"? And with an extreme effort of will, did he then place a pancreas underneath his stomach, work out the chemical structure of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nsulin and teach this to his pancreas? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Or did a very }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 successful }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mutation come about one day, as a result of a flaw in the DNA of one of these half-human beings, and then suddenly form a perfectly functioning pancreas, producing insulin hormone? But such a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 mutation could not have occurred because as we explained in a previous section, mutations do not have such beneficial effects. And even if such a situation did come about, it would still not be enough to keep these half-humans alive. There needed to have
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
formed-by coincidence, of course-a mechanism somewhere in the brain that would constantly control the level of blood sugar, command the pancreas to produce insulin, and then give the command to stop once enough insulin had been secreted. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These two "explan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ations" are obviously illogical. The evolutionists' beliefs are exactly like this, but because they themselves know how great a lie it is, they prefer not to bring it up and try to sweep it under the carpet.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
With this example of insulin, the hopeless impasse into which evolutionary logic has fallen brings us to one conclusion: The first person who ever existed had a pancreas just as we do. The "evolution" of this organ is in no way possible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Undoubtedly the sa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
me insight can be applied to other organs, different systems and processes in the body. Because thousands of other hormones and enzymes in the body are just as vital as insulin, if not more so. All of these avert critical situations, and most entail adjus
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ments much more complex than maintaining the control of insulin. The system that regulates blood pressure, for instance, is made up of much more complicated measurements and processes than the pancreatic system. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Wherever you look in the body, you will be \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
faced with the same situation. A person with no kidneys will live three days, at the most. Someone with no lungs, on the other hand, won't survive for more than one or two minutes. For anyone without a digestive system, even without just a small intestine
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to live a week would be considered a miracle. It would be impossible to last one or two hours without the liver and its nearly 200 different functions. It would be impossible to withstand the absence of a heart for even three to five seconds, to say noth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng of the brain, obviously. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 None of these organs could have formed "step by step" as a result of evolution. No human body could have waited for millions of years to receive a kidney as a result of a chance mutation. Consequently, the clear truth that star
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es us in the face is that the very first person possessed the exact same body structure we have today; that man was created by God together with a perfect, faultless body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Certainly this applies to all other living creatures as well. There is no differenc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e between the first tiger to have walked the Earth and ones alive now. The elephant, whale, eagle and snake were all created in the first beginning, the same as they are now.

The insulin molecule, which constitutes an impasse f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 or evolutionists, is only one of the many hormones in the human body. And those other hormones present proofs at least as striking as insulin's. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some of the hormones and enzymes that cells make but don't use are exported out, to be used by other cells at \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a considerable distance, which the original hormone-generating cells cannot recognize or know about in any way. Were the cells enlarged to the size of a man, the distances between them would be measured in kilometers. The cell does not know where and how 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he substances that it's produced with such care and effort will be used. But for its whole life, it continues producing these complex products, not knowing to what use they will be put.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, cells that lie below the pituitary gland, which is found \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
just under the brain, produce a very special hormone that controls kidney function. A cell in the pituitary does not know what the kidneys are, nor what they need. So how can it produce a substance so suitable to the structure of the kidneys, an organ of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hich it will have no knowledge, for as long as it lives? The undoubted answer is that it has been created by God specially to carry out this duty. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can further explain this hormone production for reasons unknown with an analogy: People in a factory work\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 their whole lives making a special complex circuit for an important electronic gadget. But these people have never seen the gadget, nor do they know what purpose it serves. In fact, they have never seen anything beyond the factory, yet they have dedicate
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 their lives to making these complex finished circuits, which they then leave outside the factory to be picked up. Someone comes along and transports the circuits thousands of kilometers away to another factory, where they are combined with some new parts
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to form the gadget in question. The people in the first factory work 24 hours a day, not knowing why, with tireless, faultless obedience. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How were these factories formed? The only answer is that without a doubt, there is a will that knows and directs both\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 factories, who has planned a certain division of labor, given the first factory the sole duty of making this particular electronic circuit, and also described in great detail how this is to be done. (It is impossible for the first factory, which cannot k
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ow what the final product looks like, to facilitate its production all by itself.)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Enzymes and hormones work in a similar way. They constantly produce substances for purposes they will never know, and devote their whole lives for this. They display not the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 slightest selfishness, boredom, caprice because they have been taught in a special way-or more accurately, they have been created for this. Just like everyone and everything else in the universe, they too submit to God, the Lord of all the worlds. They h

In the beginning, scientific circles considered the cell as the smallest living unit. But researchers have recently viewed the cell memb\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To examine it in more detail, let's first look at the structure of the cell membrane that can carry out so many processes. The membrane is composed of a double layer of lipid molecules on both sides, facing inside an

The cell membrane's main duty is to envelop the organelles within it and hold them all together. But it also has a much more complex duty: F\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rom outside the cell, it procures the necessary molecules for the organelles to continue their functions, and for the cell to stay alive. Of all the numerous substances in the environment surrounding the cell, this membrane identifies the ones that the ce

There is a great war being waged by the human immune system, which cannot be seen with the nake\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d eye. This battle continues day after day, every minute and in fact every second, between the cells protecting the body and the microbes and viruses entering from outside. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During the fiercest stage of the battle, when these two are in close contact, the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
membranes of some very special defense cells play an important role. These cells in the front line capture and then swallow all manner of foreign substances. They can do this because their cell membranes can identify any harmful substances entering the bo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y. If need be, projections on the cell membrane extend out and capture bacteria and other microbes. Once they have been captured, they're taken in by the membrane and swallowed by the cell. During this time of struggle, the cell membrane recognizes, captu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es and engulfs the enemy. The cell then digests it and uses the resulting substances in ways useful for the cell. Sometimes, special cells attach to a foreign substance and render it inactive, marking it for attack by fighter cells. Obviously, the stages 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f this war are not as simple as related here. At every stage, an organization is at work using such "intelligence" techniques as receiving, evaluating, and storing information. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This utterly complex war mechanism cannot be reproduced by even the latest hum\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an technology. It's been working for thousands of years and keeps doing so with the same perfection. In that case, what should we conclude? Is the cell membrane-a large part of which is made up of fatty molecules and which can hardly be seen with a micros
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ope-more intelligent than man, who claims to be the most superior and intelligent of all creatures? Or has this membrane been inspired with a much more superior intelligence? This is the truth, and anyone who claims otherwise must accept that the cell's b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ain is superior to his own. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some people attribute all of this to the brain, stating, "The brain sends the commands. The brain controls everything." With this conclusion, they think they have solved a great mystery with this simple logic. Comfortable with 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
their answer for the time being, they feel no need to think about the rest. But their squashed conscience begins to feel a little uncomfortable. If they delve deeper, they know that they will be faced with questions they won't be able to answer: Doesn't t

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ther to make decisions? How do these brainless, unconscious cells suddenly gain the ability to receive signals and give orders when they come together, and how do they act on these so perfectly?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Where is the brain that directs the amazingly coordinated div\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ision and differentiation of cells, when the human being is just a single cell and has no brain to speak of? The mother's brain? But her blood doesn't even mix with the baby's. What brain gives its orders to a test-tube baby, still a single cell fertilize

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Which brain controls a fertilized egg incubated by a mother hen until it becomes a tiny chick? Is there another secret brain that directs the single cell of the chick or human baby? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
An unbeliever will face this type of questions when he starts to think more deeply. Eventually, he will have to accept these clear proofs of the existence of God and His superior creation-which is why he will continue to avoid thinking about the meaning b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hind these events from a wider perspective.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The logic of unbelief is a constant avoidance from meeting God, blinding oneself to everything that reminds one of Him and turns one to Him. Blinding oneself to the many proofs of His existence, and holding tight
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ly to the slightest possibility assumed to somehow substitute for Him, this person has attributed his own creation, existence and the continuation of his life to trillions of cells, even to the molecules and atoms that compose these cells. In other words,

The act of multiplying mentioned above is no simple process. For division and multiplication to take place, the original cell must copy itself, and these copies must in turn produce copies of themselves, in time resulting in millio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ns of duplicates of that original cell. But this whole process is much more complex and mysterious than it might seem, because at some stage of the division process, some of the copied cells receive a command to differentiate from their sister cells and f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rm completely different structures. With time, cells arising from the same parent cell differentiate during the process of cell division to form different tissues and organ systems. Some become light-sensitive retinal cells, others liver cells, others ner
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e cells receptive to heat and cold, and some become auditory cells sensitive to sound waves. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How does this division of labor come about? Since a cell cannot decide on its own to become a retina, where does this decision originate?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The DNA or genetic information contained in all of these cells is identical. The difference is in the proteins the cells produced. The first cell to produce different proteins differentiates in its structure as well. If daughter cells arise from the same 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ell, with the same genetic information, then how does one of them suddenly start manufacturing different proteins and begin to specialize in its structure and features?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Who gave the command for these precise copies of each other to begin producing differen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t proteins from one another?

So as the above verses explain, the secret behind the perfect balance and harmony of the human body's formation during the process of cell division lies in the infinite power of God. Every cell carries out the duty God has assigned to it and will 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 become whatever He has determined with His command of "Be." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is why the human body is perfectly formed from cells with no wills of their own, but follow the will of God. Cells multiply by dividing and are thus able to form a faultless human nose, hand\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, eyelid, or kidney. They divide for as long as required and stop at the appropriate time. That cells do not divide uncontrollably-for instance, that a nose doesn't keep dividing until it becomes like an elephant's trunk-is a clear sign of this control. T
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e feverish division of these unconscious cells to bring about a human being's internal organs and external appearance is a proof of God's infinite power. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The volition that creates a human being does not belong to these cells. The creator can only be God a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd, just as He has commanded the entire universe to submit to His will, so has He commanded cells. About this matter, the Qur'an tells us the following:

Above, we wrote of the cell's division and differentiation proce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sses in very rough outline, but the real process is much more complex and detailed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As a result of division, two identical cells form. These two cells will grow and divide to form four cells that are exact copies of each other in terms of structure and fun\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ction. This process will continue on in the same manner. But if this "normal" process is allowed to continue, what will form in the mother's womb is a large piece of tissue, not a baby. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After a certain number of divisions, something happens to one of the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
two identical cells. Instead of continuing to divide, one of them suddenly begins to produce a special protein that will determine its structure. In contrast, the other twin cell does not produce any proteins and keeps on dividing. But after about four or
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
five divisions, its offspring cells begin to produce a protein. In this way, cells differentiate into becoming hundreds of different variations with different features, despite all having come from the same original parent cell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The "science" meant by evol\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
utionists observes all of these events, but cannot explain the logic behind them. A Will, Whose existence evolutionists do not wish to accept, commands cells to begin dividing and when the time comes, differentiating. In response, evolutionists give ridic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lous explanations for this process they observe, speaking of these events as "miracles of nature." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During the process of differentiation, cells act as if they know exactly what they're doing. They differentiate not just in the production of proteins, but \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
also in terms of their shape, which aligns with their future function. Cells to form nerves develop into long structures in order to transmit electrical signals. Connective cells form spherical shapes able to withstand pressure. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Bone cells also begin to f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
orm at the embryonic stage. Some that appear ordinary begin to accumulate calcium for no apparent reason, and as a result form very rigid tissue that is extremely strong, able to carry kilograms of weight throughout one's entire life. But bone is much lig

As the embryo develops in its mothers womb, the different cells that compose it come \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Just as a particular plan is followed in a building's construction,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 so too do the cells follow a particular building plan. For the formation of an organism, however, a time plan is also needed to determine what is to be done when, and in which order. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If there is no determination of when and where to start construction, o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r when each part should be assembled one by one, then even the best plan is useless. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We know that it's necessary to construct a building in basic stages: Once the walls go up, then the roof can be put in place. But we cannot proceed to plastering the wall\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s before installing the electrical wiring and water pipes, so while the walls are being erected, it's necessary to leave gaps where the electrical wires and water pipes can later be placed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thus, besides a building plan to be followed to the letter, a deta\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iled timeframe is also needed. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The cells that will build a human being need similar planning. But almost nothing is known about which part of the plan is followed before any other. As yet, biologists have not determined when a cell needs to ignore a certa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in part of the plan it's following, much less who is in control of this plan overall. While some genes-that is, files containing information about every characteristic and organ-are inhibited at just the right time when necessary, it is not known how some
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 genes' "lock" is opened, who gives the command to suppress genes or later, to negate the command and allow the gene to resume into action. These questions have left scientists in the dark.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An invisible authority determines the correct time and place, and h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ow the genes are to go into action. In this way too, the cell begins to make the necessary proteins to specialize accordingly. Skin cells, for instance, are rich in a special protein called keratin, which gives the skin special protection. Muscle cells ar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 enveloped in a protein called myosin, which has the special ability to affect a similar protein and change its length. It can therefore facilitate the contraction of muscle fibers. Brain cells, on the other hand, contain helper proteins that transmit ele
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tricity. All other cells of specialized tissue produce unique proteins to the tissue that determine the particular type of cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In this way, some cells produce keratin in order to become skin cells and others, myosin to become muscle cells. Actually, all cells contain in their DNA the genes needed to produce keratin and myosin, ready for use at any time. But while skin cells use t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e genes for keratin, the genes for myosin are skipped over. The enzyme that produces the mRNA finds and reads only the genes for keratin and takes them to the ribosomes, the cell's production center. This way, the cell produces no myosin or any other irre
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 evant protein, but only keratin. It has finally become a skin cell and nothing else. In muscle cells, on the other hand, the gene for myosin is "read" and the gene for keratin skipped over.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As the embryo develops, the DNA must use each gene in a programmed\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 manner as the need arises and ignore others. Hundreds of proteins are needed for the formation of any particular type of cell. In other words, while many genes are used or "read" in a particular cell, many more genes coded for proteins for other speciali
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 z\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed cells are not. The DNA and all the genes must know when these genes need to begin work, and when they need to stay out of action. If the DNA lacked this control, and if other unwanted genes were read along with ones the cell needed, this would result i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a mass of tissue with cells of different types all mixed together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consequently, with the magnificent plan and intelligence at work here, we can see no created being who could possess such intelligence. The truth is, the Master of this whole plan and extr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 go, or a timing difference of a hundredth of a second, can result in a baby born with legs coming out of its head or ears coming out of its chest. But the system is so perfect that no such mistakes are made.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Following this special path, the cells travel wi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thin the embryo until they reach their destination, recognize it and stop there. Billions of cells know beforehand the path they will take and their destination. Moreover, they make decisions about starting their journey and stopping when they get where t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ey belong. As a result, no stomach cell ever gets confused with a liver cell. The perfectly working inner organs of the human body never become just an accumulation of tissue. As the cells slowly start to take the shape of a human being, not the slightest
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 confusion or disorder takes place. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During all these events, the migrating cells must recognize the other cells located at their destination. For example, during development of the nervous system, millions of developing neurons, or nerve cells, try to find
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 pairs by forming connections with each other. Once they do, they join together perfectly in a magnificent feat of engineering to form the organ's final shape and structure. For instance, brain cells form about 120 trillion electrical connections in order
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to facilitate the necessary information flow among them. Even one faulty connection or short circuit would ruin this amazing electronic circuitry, whose like has never been duplicated artificially. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But it is impossible for trillions of cells with no abili\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ty to think or plan to work together, move together in harmony, and find their partners within a perfect measurement and plan, set out on their own and find their way to settle in the right location. Obviously, they take their journey under the guidance o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a Power to which everything submits and which controls everything, and that causes them to reach their destination. This is why it is not possible for cells to lose their way, take a wrong turn or go to the wrong place, or to confuse pairs.

Another miracle we can observe during fetal development is proportional growth-for organs to grow at the same time, at the same rate. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each organ has a particular size. In order to attain to this exact size, nothing more or less, tim\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing needs to be adjusted very carefully. Paired organs like hands, feet, ears, and eyes need to start forming and stop growing at the same time, so they will have reached the same size at the end of their development. In the same way, in order for any org
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n to be symmetrical, its cells need to move in synchrony with each other at the correct time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What would happen if this didn't occur? Consider two organs growing at different rates, independently of each other. Imagine the result if, for instance, the bra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in grew at a much faster rate than the skull surrounding it. The skull, not expanded to a sufficient capacity, would squeeze the brain, leading to the death of the baby. Or else the brain will continue growing and distort the skull, leading to the damage 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f both. Or if the skin develops much more slowly than the body's framework, the skeleton and appendages continuing to develop at greater speed will stretch the skin until it tears. We can give many examples, from the harmonious development of the cell mem
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rane and the cell organelles to the balanced growth of the skeleton and internal organs...

 circulatory system that supplies blood and nutrients to the body's 100 trillion normal cells also carries these needed nutrients to cancerous cells. Available blood vessels, however, are not enough to feed these greedy cells which multiply so rapidly. Bu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cancer cells overcome this obstacle by stimulating the cells next to them to produce new blood vessels. Research has shown that cancerous cells secrete a substance that causes blood vessels to develop. In this way, new blood vessels reach right into the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ass of cancer cells, allowing them to keep on dividing. It is still not known exactly what this secretion is, anything about its properties or how it affects cells. But as the blood vessels grow and transport more nutrients, the cancer grows also. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 truly amazing: In order to survive and multiply, a cancerous cell synthesizes a substance that modern technology can neither understand nor duplicate. This substance causes blood vessel cells to form new vessels to bring them nutrients. This point leaves
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 us with an unavoidable question: How did the cancer cell gain such knowledge?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order for it to do all this }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 by itself}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ill activate new bloods vessel and bring them into service. Should we see the cancer cell as possessing greater intelligence than ourselves? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important point is that the first diseased cell that began the cancer wasn't a cancerous cell from birth. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
It appeared to be normal, but suddenly with an unknown command, it degenerated and became cancerous. So if it has become a cancer cell after, where did it learn the formula for that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Undoubtedly there is a great subtlety and important purpose behind God's creation of cancer. By demonstrating what painful results come about with the slightest changes to the system He has created, God r

For what reason should any cell develop these properties, which are so di\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fficult to overcome? This is still not known. What triggers the transformation of a normal cell into a cancerous one is still a big question. But some of the facts we know about how cancer begins are reminiscent of mutation-in other words, a change in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 DNA of one single cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Mutations and cancer have the following relationship:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1) Cancer always begins with a sudden change in one cell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2) Once that cell becomes diseased, all other cells produced from it are identical: the bad characteristic is passed on\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  from generation to generation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3) Cancerous cells seem stronger and more durable than normal cells and gain advantages that keep them alive.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4) Most of the cancer-causing agents-chemicals, X-rays and UV rays, for example-also cause mutations.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consequently\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, the most likely cause of cancer is a change in the cell's DNA, that is, a mutation. Obviously the opposite is true: a mutation that causes a change in the DNA, would also lead to cancer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is another piece of evidence that brings the theory of evoluti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
on to its knees once again. If you remember, evolutionists use mutations as one of their most important explanations for how living things could arise from one original source, yet still be so different. They claim that mutations bring about "coincidental
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 changes in organisms, some of which are "beneficial," leading to the formation of a new species which has adapted a useful characteristic. But as mentioned earlier, there's no such thing as a "beneficial" mutation, regardless of how the evolutionists may
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
claim otherwise. Most mutations we know of result in fatal diseases like cancer or the ailments seen after Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl. Thus mutations, the last resort evolutionists take to explain the evolution of species, can only destroy an exis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ing system.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Actually, this harmful characteristic of mutations only emphasizes once more the magnificent information in the billions of codes within DNA. Any change in the DNA which has been written with such perfect subtlety could mean the end of the orga
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nism. That even a single change can lead to cancer demonstrates even more clearly that human DNA could not have come about as a result of coincidence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, health does not come about by coincidence, but is the result of a very special creation and bo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
unty bestowed by God. Our response is to give Him thanks, because God can take away this health whenever He wills, and every day He shows us that He can create fatal sickness in any part of the body.

Present in the cell is a much more perfect system than those mentio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ned above. The primary source of all energy is the Sun. Plants use sunlight to make food or, more correctly, they use the energy in sunlight and store it in the form of nutrients they produce. The human body breaks down into smaller parts the nutrients it
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
receives from these plants, and from animals that feed on these plants. These small molecules, which make up the raw materials of energy production are oxidized by the cell and taken to the mitochondria, the cell's power station. The mitochondria breaks t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ese down even further, releasing the energy contained within, and converts this energy into ATP, a form of energy the cell can use. All the events taking place in the cell occur as a result of the energy this fuel provides. Up till now, what we have given
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is a very short summary of the highly complex chemical reactions that actually take place during the production of energy in the mitochondria. These chemical miracles occur in an area only 100th of a millimeter-an area too small to even conceive of.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cell, oxygen plays the major role in the production of energy. During each stage, many different enzymes go into action. Enzymes that finish their duty at one stage give way to other enzymes for the next. These dozens of minor processes, hundreds of diff
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rent enzyme transformations, and endless chemical reactions lead to the conversion of the energy stored in food into a form the cell can use.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thus we can state that the cell's power station is much more complex than a gasoline refinery or hydroelectric sta\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion.

An oil refinery is built by engineers who know the technical information and chemical analyses of crude oil in laboratories. It's difficult to imagine people who know nothing about petroleum building a refinery. But this impossibility is no problem when i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 comes to mitochondria's energy production in the cell. Because a fertilized egg develops in the mother's womb and divides to form a human baby, the mitochondria in its cells have never had contact with the outside world, nor-until birth-have they ever en

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Where did the mitochondria learn such a skill?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The truth is that no organelle can "learn" a biolog\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 x\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
istence right from the start. Otherwise, the oxygen that plays such a major role in energy production will, at that point, destroy the cell. The cell must have been equipped with a perfect system of withstanding oxygen, right from when it first formed. It

The cell's greatest enemy is a microscopic organism called a virus. The battle between these tw\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o tiny living entities has great significance for humankind. Some viruses merely cause annoying sicknesses like the flu, but others can lead to deadly diseases such as AIDS and typhoid.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The attack of viruses on cells is typically fatal, but also quite amaz\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing because of their highly advanced techniques. The basic viral strategy is to strike at the cell with its own machinery and weapons. The way a virus makes copies of itself is in a sense, a suicide attack, because to perpetuate on the next generation of

One of the strangest organic structures found in nature, viruses do not have a living body, but contain only a genetic mechanism. A virus is nothing more than a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 genetic code (either RNA or DNA) found inside a protein envelope. It has no organelle or functions that would indicate life. But when it makes contact with a living cell, it virtually comes to life, displays features of a living thing, enters the cell, a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d in fact becomes an offensive and very clever organism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A virus uses the cleverest techniques of attack against the human body. Before it enters a cell, it first determines with its leglike fibers whether the particular cell is appropriate for it to ente\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r. If its test comes out positive, it releases its DNA into the cell, which, in effect, means that the "guts" of the virus itself enters the cell, leaving its protein coat behind. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After this initial event, the mechanisms inside the cell are now deceived b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y the virus. The cell does not identify this new DNA that has just entered as foreign. It is transported to the nucleus, where the cell's own DNA is located. The viral DNA now reaches the nucleus and is incorporated into the cell's DNA. From this point on
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the cell begins to replicate the viral DNA, thinking it is just making the cell's ordinary proteins. Unaware of the difference, the cell continues its production of the viral DNA. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Actually it is very difficult for the cell to realize this deception. Differentiating between viral DNA that's become incorporated into the cell's DNA would be like trying to find a sentence hidden on one page of a 20-volume encyclopedia. Thanks to this c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nning strategy, the virus can insert itself into the cell's programming mechanism and actually become a part of the cell itself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It's possible to completely change the meaning of a sentence simply by flipping a phrase or a few words in it. And this is just\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the type of critical change a virus effects to sabotage the cell's whole production facility and derail it from its original purpose. The viral DNA places itself in a critical location in the cell nucleus, changing the whole meaning of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 production code}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Normally, the cell reads no protein codes apart from those proteins necessary to itself. But now, with the viral DNA codes locked into its own, the cell reads both and, literally as if bewitched, begins production. How does the virus take control of the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  cell's protein manufacturing mechanism, and affect its enzymes, making it copy its own viral code and produce its own proteins? This is still a mystery. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This event prepares the way for the cell's inevitable end. Dying, the cell utilizes all its energy in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 producing the changed code now present in its nucleus. In the end it dies and is torn apart. The replicated virus, which has virtually sucked the life out of this cell, disperses through the bloodstream to other cells and finds new victims for itself. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s viral invasion spreads exponentially.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If it weren't for the body's defense mechanism, this invasion would spread rapidly enough to kill a normal person within a few days. But within a very short time, our defense system realizes that a virus has entered 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the body and immediately begins a counterattack. Consequently, a person who could otherwise die from a simple cold virus is allowed to survive. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These interesting behaviors of viruses are as thought-provoking as they are shocking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First of all we need to a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sk how a virus found in nature can possess the knowledge to invade a human body and take over its cells? For a virus to be able to do this, it must know the human cell intimately, and must be able to find a way to incorporate its own DNA into that of a hu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 an being's. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But it's wholly illogical to think that this could happen. A virus is made up of only DNA with an envelope surrounding it. It cannot possess the ability to recognize the human body and change itself accordingly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here we are faced with an inesc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 apable truth: A virus has been especially created to enter the human body and insert itself into its DNA. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To use another analogy, imagine that while walking through an empty field, you came across a highly sophisticated door lock and then a little while l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ater, you found a key. If you then put the key in the lock and the door opened, what would you conclude? Would you say, "What a coincidence! This piece of metal opened the lock by chance"? Or would you conclude that the key was crafted to open the lock, b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t that they had merely been placed in different locations? Being intelligent, of course you would accept the second conclusion. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A virus and the human body have a similar lock-and-key relationship. A virus that has existed in nature for tens of thousands o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f years with no relationship with a human cell, suddenly enters the body, goes straight to the cell, and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

. First of all, it breaks down the cell wall, because it has been designed to penetrate this wall. Then it integrates with the cell's DNA\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , because it has been created in such a way that it can do so.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In other words, viruses have been created in order to enter the human body and cause diseases. God willed for people to be prone to illness. Since man is liable to get haughty and proud, only w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ith these types of illnesses can he perceive his weakness and utter dependence on God. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, while God creates the disease, He also creates its cure. While He has created the virus, He has also created a defense mechanism that puts up a magnificent fig\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ht against this virus, which is how mankind can resist so many of the different viruses we encounter every day. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, God sometimes uses viruses as a }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cause of death}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

Plants play a huge role in keeping our Earth livable. Plants clean the air that we breathe and moderate our planet's temperature. If plants did not release oxygen into the air we breathe, neither humans nor animals would live for very long. The amount of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 xygen in the atmosphere would soon be depleted, and all living things would die of suffocation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A large portion of our nutrients is also derived from plants, which prepare these nutrients from three basic substances: earth, sunlight, and water. In spite of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 this, each plant species has a particular shape, color, taste and smell unique to it, which hasn't changed for thousands of years.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As with all other functions, plants' ability to produce nutrients for themselves, as well as for animals and humans, is a re\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sult of the special properties found in their cells. Plant cells have a different structure from humans' and animals' cells, and have been created in such a way as to be the source of nutrients for all living organisms, besides cleaning and refreshing the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 atmosphere. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Even though plant cells seem stationary, there is great activity within. At every second they are absorbing water and other minerals and elements they need from the earth. To these they add the carbon dioxide absorbed from the air and most imp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ortantly, energy from the sun to produce nutrients and clean oxygen for animal and human life. This feverish production is carried on within the trillions of tiny cells in the trees that we see every day.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most important property distinguishing plant ce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The person wondering about the source of the beauty in these sparkles has two choices. Either he must assume that each sparkle formed by itself on the water independent\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Since the theory of evolution denies c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, maggots de\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
veloping in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

 long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck

The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he advanced in the 1930s, he tried to prove that a living cell could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession:

Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve this problem. The best known experiment was carried out by the American chemist Stanley Miller in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial Earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins.

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Dar\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
win tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uring their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leav
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid16009519\charrsid10625468 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1

However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thu

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930s. Neo-\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and ra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ndom effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s19\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid10625468 \rtlch\fcs1 \af8\afs18\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0

First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building whic

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
utation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary pro

very living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else over time and all species have come into being in this way. In other words, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Besides all the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rm even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let evolutionists put plent\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids and as many proteins-a single one of which has a formation probability of 10}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

-as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canari
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indee
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with God's superior creation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fal\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of evolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the exc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitte
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. Howeve
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rld cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much res
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
arch has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimens
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 onal image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possibl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
p the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound le
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 el in your brain measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ntered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the working

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nto a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; such scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people, it is quite justifiable to speak of this theory as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fused to allow them to think intelligently and logically, and hidden the truth from them as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact, God has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

e would say that this topic belongs to the realm of biology or chemistry, reasoning that any treatise about the cell could only be a biology or a chemistry textbook. However, the book you hold in your hands is no textbook. Its aim is neither to increase y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ur scientific knowledge, nor teach you biology in detail, because by itself, increased biological knowledge is of no benefit.

 that need to be asked. This book analyzes some of the technical details about the cell but at the same time, asks the necessary questions and searches for the wisdom behind the events that are usually so dryly described.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s the intelligence of God.
