A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, God\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s existence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the last 140 years it h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 anic verses, and invite readers to learn God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s verses are explaine\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mind. The books\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0  sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discusse\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hese books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader will\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s personal views, explana\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\rquote \loch\f0 s Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s works, translated into 41 different languages, constitute a collection for a total of more than 45,000 pages with 30,000 illustrations.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (Joh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against their people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s lack of faith. The Prophet
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s seal on his books\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an (the Final Scripture) and Prophet Muhammad (may God b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ess him and grant him peace), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 last word,\'94\loch\f0  so as to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ompletely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yah\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ya\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s works share one single goal: to convey the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Har\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
un Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, Spain to Brazil, Malaysia to Italy, France to Bulgaria and Russia. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Ita
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Chinese, Swahili, Hausa, Dhivehi (spoken in Mauritius), Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, Indonesian, Bengali, Danish and Swedish. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ave been instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriousl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s search for God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  co

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of dis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 belief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speed\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ly and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promi

urrent location, its destination or target, and the route that it must follow to get there. In addition, migrating animals need to have sound knowledge of their current habitat\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s location, since they must use this information on their return. They must al\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o know what conditions will be awaiting them when they reach the end of migration, sometimes tens of thousands of kilometers (hundreds of miles) away. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Historically, human explorers and seafarers have used the Sun and the stars to establish their location.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

en an animal sets off on its journey, factors different from the ones that guide humans come into play. Each migrating species has a different method of finding and following a route. Broadly speaking, however, birds make use of the Sun, the stars and the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Earth\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s magnetic field; and fish make use of chemical scents in the water coming from rivers. Naturally, they require expertise to evaluate the available data and arrive at a conclusion. Getting to the right destination using only the stars, or traces of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iver chemicals are tasks that few people could manage. This brings to mind a series of questions that need to be answered:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - How do these animals know in which direction from their current location lie suitable habitats, breeding and feeding grounds? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e moment an animal comes into the world, how can it decide that a far-off place it has never seen is a suitable environment?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - How have animals discovered that they can use the stars and the Sun to find their way?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - Who teaches them how to do so, from the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 time they enter the world?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The common answer to these questions is that animals are not capable of any of these feats on the strength of their own intelligence and knowledge. The information they possess to undertake such a journey is given them before the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y are born. They are programmed. In that case, who is their programmer? It is God, of course, Who knows all. Their Creator and the Creator of all things inspires these skills in them. Any efforts to explain this by the imaginary evolutionary theory are et
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rnally doomed to failure. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Ants that use the Sun as a reference can find their way without getting lost, due to the abilities they have been given. However, the Sun moves at an angle of approximately 15 degrees an hour, which makes using it as a reference 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 point more difficult. But on their way home, these little insects establish their current location by taking into consideration how long they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 ve been outside and the angle by which the Sun\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 s position has changed, to find their way back to the nest without\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
going astray. Honeybees, too, are able to know the movements of the Sun and make estimates accordingly. If these bees have found a food source in a south-easterly direction by the end of the day, in the morning before setting off again, they calculate how
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
much the Sun has changed position and move in the correct direction toward the food source. From the moment they emerge from pupation, they need the knowledge of how to be guided by the Sun and make calculations based on the position of that moving heaven

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Deserts feature vast tracts of sand with no distinguishing features. The surface is so hot and dry that in most places it is impossible for weeds or scrub to grow. Co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each one traces a zigzag as it runs. Every second or so it stops, raises its head, makes a half turn on one leg and starts running again. As soon as it finds food, it must return to the nest before the Sun affects it.

 This behavior is remarkable, for to be able to do\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as gathered during its journey of roughly 15 minutes, it has established the exact distance and direction back to the nest.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Birds\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  nocturnal migration is advantageous in a number of ways. Most importantly, in this way they can evade their enemies\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 like hawks and falcons. A large number of migrating species are small and have weak flying capacity, so it is safer for these birds to fly in the dark. But night migration is not just for safety alone, for some coastal birds\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another reason why birds choose night for travel is that birds feeding during the day usually have a very rapid digestion. Consequently, they have to eat at short intervals, a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd these calories must be deposited in their body in the form of fat. Were small migrators to make long flights during the day, they would be exhausted on arriving at their destination, and since they cannot forage at night, they would have to wait until 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he next morning. As a result of being unable to obtain energy, many would probably be unable to survive in a cold environment. For this reason, these creatures act in a very programmed fashion, feeding by day and migrating at night, resting at sunrise and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 continuing on in this cycle. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Although this has not been proven, one advantage of traveling at night may be the cooler air temperatures. Birds that flap their wings constantly in sunlight run the risk of overheating. Night travel prevents this danger. More

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Along with \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
their fat deposits, birds probably lose body water while flying non-stop. Accordingly, on night migrations they can take advantage of the cooler air to lower their body temperature and reduce water loss to a minimum, which affords them increased flying di

Besides the species created with a suitable body structure for night migration, there are also birds suited to daytime migration, such as ducks, cranes, seagulls, pelicans, hawks and swallows. Storks and condors that glide can fly by day only, beca

It is hardly likely that without help, a person could manage to get to his birthplace thousands of kilometers away, by an arduous route he had only followed once before, without taking a wrong turn. But from birth, salmon can succeed at som

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, it has to determine its route. A fish is hatched in some branch of a river quite a way inland. Rivers often have many branches. Accordingly, for the salmon to return to where it came, it \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
must choose the right fork every time. Salmon manage to find their way on routes they have descended only once before, correctly choosing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 again and again\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
the branch of the river that will take them to their natal streams. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Throughout the journey, salmon ex\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pends a lot of effort and an enormous amount of energy, but in spite of this it eats nothing at all, because the energy it will need on its tiring journey has already been stored. What\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When examining such factors as the respective salinity of the sea and of the rivers, it emerges that salmon are perfectly equipped to live both in the sea and in freshwater environments. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In spite of all their difficulties, salmon succe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ssfully return to their birthplace to spawn; and have been making this incredible journey for millions of years.

source of knowledge. Evolutionary sources refer to coincidence as a power with foresight that can take preventative measures, create perfect designs, and make decisions for a specific purpose. When animals\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In migration, many animals cover vast distances with nothing to show the way or any instrument to guide them. When weather conditions and climatic changes are taken into consideration, as well as the s

their journeys are made by individual, solitary birds and during the night. And whether the journey is to be 1,000 or 10,000 kilometers (620 or 6,200 miles), great physiological preparation is necessary. Some of the problems that migrators may encounter i

 in migratory behavior is so complex that refusing to see it as the product of creation can be explained only with Darwinist dogmatism. For example, consider the preparations that start taking place prior \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
to migration: Birds go into an accelerated feeding to store energy for their upcoming journey. Some birds double their body weight in this period of excessive eating known as \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 hyperphagia,\'94\loch\f0 
 which is part of the genetically controlled migration process. In\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erestingly, this behavior starts two to three weeks before migration, just before the food supply diminishes, which prevents the birds from experiencing lack of energy before their long journey. From the bird\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another physiological mechanism related to migration that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 evolutionists cannot explain is the marked changes in birds\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 hormone levels. The neuroendocrinal system, responsible for nervous stimulation and inner hormone secretion, triggers diurnal changes affecting the pituitary gland and the pineal, the gland in b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 So he flies north, looking for a little cooler weather. And then each year, he may go a little further south, a little further north until they get all the way up to the Arctic and all the way down to South America.\'94\loch\f0  Well, this little
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 bird breaks that rule. First of all, it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s a very small bird, about the size of a dove. And it\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

as an 88-hour flight, nonstop because there is no land in between. Three days and four nights, nonstop. How does it do that? Well, these little birds begin to eat a lot, and they gain about 70 grams of burnable energy. Here is the problem: We\hich\f0 
\rquote \loch\f0 ve got an 88\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 -\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hour flight, and they burn 1 gram per hour. That only gives them 70 hours worth of fuel. So they\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

ologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused ne

The subject most often brought up by advocates of the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. The Darwinist claim holds that modern man evolved from ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutiona\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 iny spot at the back of the brain, the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 center of vision.\'94\loch\f0 
 These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 hat its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 center of vision
\'94\loch\f0  is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
our head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have bee
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possibl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
han the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain measured by a precise d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 vice at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there.

demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken o

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason is that this theory is an indispe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

rs, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwin
