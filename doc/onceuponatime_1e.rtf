ritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of Creation \endash  and therefore, God's existence \endash 
 over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty t
o show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject.

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qu
r'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that
 
everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and c
annot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to commun
icate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, 
pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, Adnan Oktar was born in Ankara in 1956. Having c
ompleted his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahy
a is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par Harun Yahya's works, translated into 57 different languages, constitute a collection for a total of more than 45,000 pages with 30,000 illustrations.
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against their peoples' lack of f
aith. The Prophet's (may God bless him and grant him peace) seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace), last of the pro
p
hets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of irreligious ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised a
gainst religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to conve
y the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose irreligious systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in m
any countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, Spain to Brazil, Malaysia to Italy, France to Bulgaria and Russia. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albani
an, Chinese, Swahili, Hausa, Dhivehi (spoken in Mauritius), Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, Indonesian, Bengali, Danish and Swedish. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people r
ecovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer 
a
dvocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since 
these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in 
removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Tho
se who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in 
mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders o
f
 creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too 
late. 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

Throughout the years, people have observed their universe and tried to uncover its secrets. To answer some thorny questions, many scientists have made important discoveries, considering the restrictions of the age they lived in; and others have been notew
orthy in their own times, yet the claims they made later came to be regarded as scientific errors.
\par Claudius Ptolemy was a scientist and philosopher of the second century CE, who lived in Alexandria when it was the center of scientific research. He observed 
the skies in order to learn about the universe and the world's place in it and pondered the movements of the Sun, Moon and stars. Finally, he concluded that the Earth must be the center of the universe. According to his theory, the Earth was motionless, a
n
d the Sun, Moon and the stars all rotated around it. His writings attracted much attention, were translated into many languages, and had a great influence, especially on European culture. The Catholic Church based its theology on Ptolemy's Earth-centered 
m
odel. Within a short time, some people noticed discrepancies in his theory, but were forced into silence because of the wide popularity that Ptolemy enjoyed. Once noticed, however, these discrepancies could not be easily ignored. By the 15th century, Cope
r
nicus had shown the errors in Ptolemy's ideas and came out firmly against the idea of an Earth-centered universe. As the centuries went on, it became known that the Earth was a planet revolving around the Sun, which was only one star among millions of oth
ers in the Milky Way, and that the Milky Way was just one example of countless other galaxies composed of stars.
\par Humans had always bee
n fascinated by fire and the flames it gives off, but its secret had not yet been discovered. Towards the end of the 1600s, a German scientist, G.E. Stahl, tried to discover the source of fire. As a result of his experiments, he proposed that fire was cau
sed by an invisible substance called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 phlogiston}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
, which he believed could penetrate and emerge from objects. Any object that contained phlogiston burned quickly, while substances lacking phlogiston did not burn at all. The smoke coming from a burning object 
was thought to be expulsion of phlogiston from it, as the burning material shrank and weakened. It was also believed that when burning material was smothered, it hindered the expulsion of phlogiston, and so the fire went out. But in time it was observed t
hat metals did not shrink or weaken as they burned, and so certain doubts grew up about phlogiston's reality. 
\par Towards the end of the 18th century, the atmosphere was found to be composed of several different gasses. While some tried to explain the differen
t ways in which these gasses burned in terms of the phlogiston theory, experiments performed with oxygen showed the theory to be invalid. As a result of his observing metal burning in oxygen, Antoine Lavoisier, a French scientist, discovered that the weig
ht of the burning metal increased, while the amount of oxygen decreased. His experiments demonstrated the source of fire. Objects burn when they absorb oxygen. The hypothetical substance called phlogiston had never existed! 
\par Another example of an historic scientific error is the "explanation" for the origin of electricity. In the 1780s, Italian physician Luigi Galvani performed experiments with animals and suddenly came across a new source of electricity\emdash 
or so he believed. In his experiments with frogs, he saw the frog's leg muscles contract when in contact with metal. As a result, he concluded that metal extracts electricity from the muscles and nerves of animals. 
\par Galvani had performed this experiment on one single leg with one piece of metal. However, Ales
sandro Volta, a colleague of his who suspected the real explanation behind this experiment, began his own work on the subject. He attached two ends of a wire to a frog's leg and observed no muscular contraction. After this, Volta went on to refute the pro
posal that electricity came from a frog or any other animal. Electricity is produced by a stream of electrons, and metal conducts the electrons more easily. The theory of "animal electricity" was simply an error of a particular moment in history.
\par These exam
ples clearly show that in the past, some totally wrong claims have been made about processes that are very well known today. Scientists have been caught up in various errors either because of the unsophisticated research equipment of their time, their lim
ited understanding, or because of their own prejudices. Among such scientific errors, the greatest\emdash and most enduring\emdash 
historic example is one theory put forward concerning the origins of life. This theory's illogical claims have exerted a much greater influe
nce than any of the examples given above. This error, called Darwinism, unites a materialist world view with a belief in evolution. 
\par At one time, with insufficient evidence at hand, some people regarded this theory as scientific. Charles Darwin's book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Origin of Species }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
was known to be inconsistent, even at the time of its publication in 1859, but it awakened interest in some circles. Darwin made his assumptions without the benefit of genetics or biochemistry. But the mistaken claims he made, based on th
e then-insufficient fossil record, were avidly welcomed by those inclined to accept them for philosophical reasons. There was a clear affinity between Darwin's theory and materialist philosophy. Darwin tried to explain the origins of all living things in 
terms of chance and material factors, and therefore his theory rejected the existence of a Creator. It would take a series of discoveries made in the 20th century to show his theory to be wrong, completely irrational and illogical. 
\par In a few scientific circ
les, Darwinism is still a widespread obsession, but this does not preclude the knowledge that its days have come to an end. All the scientific suppositions that once supported the theory have crumbled, one by one. The only reason why Darwinism is still al
i
ve is because in some scientific circles, a few fanatics still passionately espouse the materialist philosophy it's based on. The world of Darwinism resembles the Soviet Union in the second half of the 1980s, when the Communist ideology had collapsed and 
i
ts suppositions had been proved wrong, but the institutions of the communist system remained in existence. The generations who had been brainwashed by communist ideology still espoused it blindly. Because of their dogmatism, the Communist system that for 
all practical purposes had collapsed was kept alive for a while longer. It was hoped that policies such as Glasnost and Perestroika could reform and revive it. Yet the inevitable collapse eventually took place.
\par Long before this collapse, however, some perceived that communism was basically exhausted. Many Western observers wrote that the Soviet establishment could do no more than slow down the inevitable collapse for a little while.
\par In this book, we describe how Darwinism, too, has long been defunct from the
 scientific point of view. It convinced some individuals for a while, but it finally became clear that it never had any real scientific foundation. The claims used in support of Darwinism over the past 150 years have all been rendered invalid. All the all
e
ged "proofs" of evolution have been refuted, one by one. Soon, all those in the scientific community who are laboring under the delusion of such a theory will realize the truth and be astonished at how they could have been taken in. As the Swedish scienti
st S\'f8ren L\'f8vtrup said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "I believe that one day the Darwinian myth will be ranked the greatest deceit in the history of science."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

s to accept the fact. 
\par In the following pages, we'll examine some scientific data that have invalidated the theory of evolution; and show that this great error was based on the inadequate level of 19th-century science.

\par 
\par If today's journalists, writers, philosophers, scientists, academics or university students were surveyed as to why they believe in the theory of evolution and what the evidence for it is, most of their answers would be
 unscientific myths. We can list the most common of these myths, together with why they are erroneous: 
\par 1. Proponents of evolution claim that scientific experiments have shown that life came into being spontaneously, as the result of chemical reactions. Bu
t in fact, no scientific experiment supports this claim and, moreover, it has been shown to be theoretically impossible.
\par 2. They think that the fossil record proves that there has been a process of evolution on Earth. On the contrary, however, all fossils 
reveal a natural history completely at odds with Darwin's theory: Species did not come into existence by stages through any process of evolution, but were created in all their perfection in one instant.
\par 3. They think that the celebrated }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Archaeopteryx }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 fossi
l proves their thesis that birds evolved from reptiles. But it is now known that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Archaeopteryx}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 was a true bird, capable of flight, and no reptile ancestor has ever been found. Not a single piece of evidence remains to support the evolutionists' claim that birds evolved from reptiles. 
\par 4. For years, "the evolution of the horse" was portrayed as one of the best documented proofs of the theory of evolution. Four-legged mammals that had lived in different periods were set out in order of size, from small to lar
ge, and this "horse series" was exhibited in museums of natural history. Research in recent years, however, has shown that the creatures in the sequence are not one another's ancestors, that the sequencing is seriously flawed, and that creatures depicted 
as the ancestor of the horse actually emerged after it.
\par 5. They believe that England's famous Industrial Revolution moths offer a proof of evolution by natural selection. However, the color change that occurred in moths during the Industrial Revolution has 
been proven not to be the result of natural selection. These butterflies did not change color; it was only that there were more pale moths at first but environmental conditions diminished their numbers, while the number of dark-colored moths increased. Af
ter this claim was realized to be a scientific fraud, evolutionists lost one more of their so-called proofs.
\par 6. They claim that in fossil remains, there are traces of "ape men" proving that human beings are descended from a common ancestor with apes. Howeve
r, all claims in this regard rest only on prejudiced assumptions, and even evolutionists are forced to admit that there is no fossil evidence for human evolution. For example, Richard Leakey, an evolutionist paleoanthropologist, writes:

The fossils claimed to be those of human beings' so-called ancestors have been shown to belong to either an extinct species of ape, or a different race of human being. As a r
esult, evolutionists are left without a single proof to substantiate their thesis that human beings and apes evolved from a single ancestor.
\par 7. They claim that the embryos of human beings and other creatures undergo the same "process of evolution" in their
 mothers' womb or in the egg. They even say that a human embryo has gills that subsequently disappear. These claims have been shown to be completely unfounded and to rest on a major scientific fabrication. An evolutionist biologist by the name of Ernst Ha
eckel first made this claim; he deliberately made changes in his drawings to suggest that the embryos were similar to one another. Later, even evolutionist scientists came to accept that his claim was based on an unscientific fabrication.
\par 8. They think that
 human beings and other living things have vestigial organs that have lost their function; and even believe that a great deal of DNA is "junk" with no particular function. But all these claims are known to be the result of scientific ignorance. Over time,
 
as science advanced, it was discovered that all organs and genes are indeed functional. This shows that living creatures do not have organs that have ceased to function, through the so-called process of evolution, as a result of not being used. Rather, it
 shows that these creatures, with all their organs and component parts, are not the work of chance but of a perfect creation. 
\par 9. They think that the variation in a single species\emdash for example, the differences in the size and shape of the bills of the Galapagos Islands' finches\emdash 
is a strong proof of evolution. But this is known to be no proof of evolution: Micro-changes in the structure of a bird's bill cannot create new biological data, in the form of new organs, and so do not constitute evolution. As a resul
t, even neo-Darwinists today realize that some variations within a species cannot result in evolution. 
\par 10. They believe that mutations in experiments with fruit flies have been able to produce new species. But these experiments produced only physically im
paired or sterile individuals, and no "beneficial" mutation was observed. Even in the case of mutations produced under the control of knowledgeable scientists, no new species were formed; this proves that there is no such thing as evolution. Therefore, it
 is impossible to point to mutations as proof of evolution. 
\par A large number of those interviewed, if asked why they believe in evolution, would actually know very few of the examples mentioned above, or know them only superficially. These myths they read ab
out a few times or heard about from their high-school teachers have convinced them of evolution, and they see no reason to investigate further.
\par However, every one of the supposed proofs above is completely invalid. This is no groundless claim, but a fact proven with solid evidence by scientists critical of the theory of evolution\emdash as we'll explore in the following pages. 
\par In his criticism of Darwinism, a well-known American biologist, Jonathan Wells,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 4}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 refers to the myths of evolution as "the icons of evoluti
on." By "icons," he means false and superstitious beliefs that every supporter of evolution knows by heart. The word "icon" describes objects of veneration that some false religions use to remind their members of what they regard as sacred. Some of the ic
onic symbols used to support the theory of evolution (which is actually an atheistic religion)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 5}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 for its devotees are drawings of the "ape man," "gills on a human embryo," and other such scientific fabrications. But each one of these depicts a groundless myth. Wells' book, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Icons of Evolution: Science or Myth? Why Much of What We Teach About Evolution Is Wrong?,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 lists ten icons that correspond to the list we have given here and explains in detail why all have been rendered invalid.
\par Today these myths are all di
scredited, and evolutionists have proposed no new proofs to replace them. As a theory, Darwinism convinced some people in the 19th century, when scientific conditions were unsophisticated. But in the 21st century, Darwinism has been revealed as defunct, o
utmoded and invalid.

Before we proceed to trace the demise of Darwinism's myths in the following pages, we must show the invalidity of another idea that binds supporters of evolutionary theory.
\par This is the false assumption that t
here exists a conflict between religion and science. Those who defend this assumption claim that the theory of evolution must be true because "scientists" unanimously accepted it as scientifically proven. They propose that Creation is a theory for "faith"
 
only, but not for science. However, such assertions are not based on the facts. As an example, take the ongoing argument about how the theory of evolution should be taught in United States schools. This argument is carried on solely on a scientific level,
 
but there are attempts to show it as the "disagreement between the churches and scientists." News broadcast by some media organizations, and articles in some newspapers on the matter, all suffer from the same superficial assumptions, which are wrong for t
he following reasons:
\par First, Creation }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 is}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 supported by scientific evidence. The present evolution-versus-Creation debate is not between scientists and the churches, but between scientists who stubbornly believe in the theory of evolution and other scientists
 who see that this theory is invalid. All the available evidence argues against evolution. On the strength of this evidence, the theory of evolution in the USA has declined since the second half of the 20th century, which decline has influenced the decisi
o
n taken in states like Kansas, Georgia and Ohio that schools must also teach the evidence for the theory of evolution's invalidity. In the USA, a powerful opposition arose against the theory of evolution. All members of this movement are scientists from t
h
e country's notable universities. In the 1970s Professor Dean Kenyon wrote a thesis on the origin of life and chemical evolution that made him one of evolution's well-known proponents. Today, he is a representative of the opposition movement against the t
heory of evolution and believes that the origins of life cannot be explained by evolution, only by creation.

gives a detailed account of Darwin's "theory of evolution" as a latter-day version of the materialist philosophy of the Greek thinker Epicurus and his Roman counterpart, Lucretius.
\par Darwin followed these two philosophers in writing in detail about such unscientific ideas as:
\par 1 Nature is a system that regulates itself.
\par 2 Among living creatures, there is a merciless struggle for life and this leads to evolution by means of natural selection.
\par 3 It should be avoided to give a "teleological" (the idea that they came into being for a purpose) account of nature and living things.
\par What is striking is that these ideas are not scientific. Neither Epic
urus nor Lucretius conducted scientific experiments or made observations; they just used logic completely in line with their own wishes. Moreover, their logic had an interesting starting point. Epicurus rejected the existence of a Creator, saying that it 
e
ntailed belief in an afterlife, for which reason he felt himself circumscribed. He clearly stated that his whole philosophy developed from his unwillingness to accept this proposition. In other words, Epicurus chose atheism for his own psychological comfo
r
t and later, undertook to construct a worldview based on this choice. For this reason he endeavored to explain the order of the universe and the origins of life in terms of an atheist system and with this purpose in mind, adopted ideas that would later pr
ove basic to evolution.
\par Benjamin Wiker gives this detailed interpretation of the relation between Epicurus and Darwin:

The first Darwinian was not Darwin, but a rather notorious Greek, Epicurus, born on the Island of Samos about 341 B.C. It was he who provi
ded the philosophical underpinnings of Darwinism, because it was he who fashioned an entirely materialistic, [atheistic] cosmology, where the purposeless jostling of brute matter over infinite time yielded, by a series of fortunate accidents, not only the
 Earth, but all the myriad forms of life thereon. . . .

Today, those motivated to stubbornly defend the theory of evolution are not on the side of science, but on the side of atheism. Like their precur
sor Epicurus, their attachment to atheism stems from the awareness that accepting the existence of God would clash with their own selfish desires. 
\par There is a verse in the Qur'an in which God completely describes the situation of non-believers: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "And they r

\b\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "Have you seen him who has taken his whims and desires to be his deity?"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  (Surat al-Furqan: 43)
\par The Epicurus-Darwinist "
clan" rejects the existence of God only because His existence conflicts with their personal desires and passions; in this, they are very much like those described in the verse above. Therefore, it is very deceptive to regard the evolution-Creation argumen
t as a conflict between science and religion. 
\par Evolution and Creation, two different explanations of the origins of life and the universe, have existed from ancient times. In order to understand which of these explanations is scientifically correct, we have
 to consider the discoveries of science. Here, as in our other books, we will once again see how all findings prove that the theory of evolution is erroneous, and that Creation is true.

\par 
\par Darwinism claims that all living things on Ea
rth came into being not through any purpose or plan, but as a result of random events. The first link in this chain of events is that the first living thing appeared within inanimate matter. To discuss whether or not there is a natural process of evolutio
n, first it must be demonstrated that life could actually have arisen by chance from inanimate matter. 
\par So, when we compare this "link" with scientific data, what comes to light? That is, can chance form a living organism from inanimate matter?
\par Once, it was
 thought that observation and experiment gave an affirmative answer to the above questions. That is, it was believed that living creatures could evolve spontaneously within inanimate matter. But these observations and experiments that seemed to prove thos
e assertions were extremely primitive. 
\par The ancient Egyptians living along the River Nile thought that the number of frogs increased during the rainy season because the river generated them out of the mud. They believed that not only frogs, but snakes, worm
s and mice were formed from the mud when the Nile flooded each summer. Superficial observations led the Egyptians into this superstition.
\par The boundary between animate and inanimate things was unclear not only in ancient Egypt. Many early pagan societies be
lieved that this boundary could be easily crossed. In Hindu mythology, the world came into being out of a huge, round blob of matter called }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 prakriti.}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  From this material, all animate and inanimate things evolved and will return to it again. Anaximander, the ancient Greek philosopher Thales' pupil, wrote in his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 On Nature}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  that animals came to be from some mud steaming in the heat of the Sun.
\par The basis of all these superstitions was the belief that living things were simple structures. This belief was long
 maintained in Europe, where modern science began to develop in the 16th century. But the idea that the structure of life was simple held sway for at least another three hundred years, because scientists did not have the means to observe the minute detail
s of living things, especially microscopic cells and tiny molecules.
\par A few superficial observations and experiments convinced scientists that life was simple. For example, the Belgian chemist Jan Baptista van Helmont (1577-1644), spread some wheat on a soil
ed shirt and, after a while, observed mice scurrying around the shirt. He concluded that the mice were produced from the combination of the wheat and the shirt. The German scientist Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) did a similar experiment. He poured some h
oney over some dead flies and later saw other flies were zooming around the honey; he assumed that combining honey with dead flies produced living ones.
\par More careful scientists were able to see that all these ideas were wrong. The Italian scientist Francisc
o Redi (1626-1697) was the first to do controlled experiments in this regard. Using the isolation method, he discovered that maggots on meat did not come into being spontaneously, but developed from eggs deposited by flies. Redi proved that life could not
 come from inanimate matter, but only from other life\emdash a view that came to be known as }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 biogenesis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 . The name given to the spontaneous generation of life was }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 abiogenesis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 . 
\par The scientific argument between supporters of biogenesis and abiogenesis was continued i
nto the 18th century by John Needham (1713-1781) and Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-1799). Each of them boiled a piece of meat, then isolated it. Needham observed that maggots appeared on the meat and took this as proof for abiogenesis. Spallanzani repeated th
e
 same experiment, but boiled the meat for a longer time. In this way, all organic life forms on the meat were destroyed and as a result, no maggots appeared on it. So even though Spallanzani had invalidated the theory of abiogenesis, many people did not b
elieve him; saying that Spallanzani had boiled the meat so long that he killed the "vital power" within it. 
\par As Charles Darwin was developing his theory, the question of the origins of life was obfuscated by debates like these. Many people believed that ina
nimate matter could generate bacteria and other germs, if not visible creatures like maggots. In 1860, the famous French chemist Louis Pasteur disproved the age-old assertions of abiogenesis, though it continued to hold its place in the minds of many. 

\par Darwin almost never considered how the first cell came into being. He never mentions this subject in his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  published in 1859. Even after Pasteur's experiments posed a major problem for him in this regard, he hardly dealt with the topi
c. His only explanation for the origin of life was that the first cell could have come into being in a "warm little pond." 
\par In a letter to Joseph Hooker in 1871, Darwin wrote:

ganism are now present, which could ever have been present. But if we could conceive in some warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, light, heat, electricity, etc., present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to 
undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

al raw materials for life, they could form proteins which could then multiply, and combine to form a cell. Moreover, he asserted that such a formation was impossible under present world conditions, but could have occurred in an earlier period.
\par Both of Darwin's claims are pure speculation, without scientific foundation. 
\par But they would inspire those evolutionists who came after him and launch them on a fruitless labor that would last for more than a century.
\par This hopeless effort rested on an error defended for centuries, and which also misled Darwin, that life is of pure chance and natural law.
\par Since that time, more than a century has passed, and thousands of scientists have tried to explain the origins of life in terms of evolution. Two scientists who cleared a new path in this search were Alexander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane\emdash 
one Russian, the other English, but both Marxists. They advanced the theory known as "chemical evolution," and proposed, as Darwin had dreamed of doing, that molecules\emdash the raw material of life\emdash 
could, with the addition of energy, evolve spontaneously and form a living cell. 
\par In the middle of the 20th century, Oparin's and Haldane's theory gained ground because the true complexity of life wasn't yet understood. And a young chemist by the nam
e of Stanley Miller gave apparent scientific support for the "chemical evolution" thesis.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 If you were to look at today's evolutionist literature dealing with the origins of life, you would likely see evolution's propon
ents offering the "Miller experiment" as the greatest proof for their theses. Many biology textbooks in many countries tell students how important this experiment was, and how it cast light on the problem of the origins of life. Most often, the details of
 the experiment are disregarded. What it produced and to what extent the experiment "casts light" on the origins of life are also ignored.
\par To shed some light on this experiment, let us sum up the relevant facts that we have detailed in another book. In 1953
, Stanley Miller, a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago under the supervision of his teacher, Harold Urey, composed a mixture of gasses that, he supposed, resembled the atmosphere of the primordial Earth. Afterward
s, he exposed this mixture to an electrical discharge for more than a week and, as a result, observed that some amino acids that are used in living things were synthesized, along with others that are not.
\par Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, whi
ch in turn are the basic material of the body. Hundreds of amino acids join in a particular series within a cell to produce proteins. Cells are produced from a few thousand different kinds of proteins. In other words, amino acids are the smallest componen
ts of any living thing.
\par For this reason, Stanley Miller's synthesizing of amino acids caused great excitement among evolutionists. And so the legend of the "Miller Experiment" was born and was to last for decades. 
\par However, it slowly emerged that the experi
ment was invalid. In the 1970s it was proved that the primordial Earth's atmosphere was mainly composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide and did not contain the methane and ammonia gasses that Miller used in his experiment. This showed that Miller's scenari
o was untenable, since N and CO}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\dn6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 2}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

count. He outlines the reasons for this as follows: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "the early atmosphere looked nothing like the Miller-Urey simulation."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Another fact that invalidated the Miller experiment was that the primordial atmosphere was ascertained to be rich in oxygen. This 
totally undermined both the Miller experiment and other chemical evolutionist scenarios, because oxygen has the special ability to oxidize\emdash that is, burn\emdash 
all organic molecules. In the body, this danger is averted by very special enzyme systems. In nature, it is impossible for a free organic molecule not to be oxidized.
\par For decades, despite all these facts, the Miller experiment, as we said, was touted as a very important explanation of the origins of life. In their textbooks, students were told that "Miller 
showed how organic compounds can be synthesized," or, "Miller showed how the first cells were formed." 
\par As a result, many educated people are in error in this regard. For example, in some articles dealing with the theory of evolution, one can read such sta
tements as, "Combining and boiling such organic matter as amino acids or proteins produce life." This is probably the superstition that the Miller experiment left in the minds of some. The truth is, such a thing has never been observed. As explained above
,
 the Miller Experiment, which tried to explain the formation of amino acids, let alone the origin of life, is now shown to be outmoded and invalid. It has suffered the same fate as Jan Baptista van Helmont's so-called proof for abiogenesis on the basis of
 maggots in meat or Athanasius Kircher's experiment.

, Jeremy Rifkin makes the same comparison saying that if scientists had taken the trouble to feel even the slightest suspicion, they would at once have seen tha
t the Miller experiment consisted merely of a scientific fantasy tale, just like those scientists who previously claimed, on the basis of observations of maggots emerging from rubbish, that life emerged from inanimate matter.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

\par Those who believe that Mille
r's experiment produced important results fail to understand the important point that Miller conducted his experiment under artificial conditions produced by himself, having nothing to do with the atmosphere of the early Earth; so the experiment was carri
ed out under invalid conditions. And most importantly, this experiment only synthesized amino acids. Formation of amino acids by some means does not indicate creation of life.
\par If we compare a living cell to a huge factory, amino acids are the factory's bric
ks. It's vitally important how these bricks are designed and arranged. So far, no experiment has shown how amino acids came into being spontaneously, or organized themselves by chance to produce a functional protein. To form a living cell, a complex mecha
n
ism must be wholly in place: hundreds of different proteins, DNA codes and the enzymes to read them, and a selectively permeable cell membrane. However, such a "chemical evolution" has never been shown to be possible. Moreover, to believe in such a possib
ility is to believe in the impossible. Paul Davies, the well-known physicist and science writer, makes an important comment on this matter:

aying: "Put a stick of dynamite under the pile of bricks, and bang, you've got a house!" Of course you won't have a house, you'll just have a mess. The difficulty in trying to explain the origin of life is in accounting for how the elaborate organizationa

Shortly after 1950, science advanced to the point where it could determine the shapes and properties of a few of the molecules that make up living organisms. Slowly, painstakingly, the structures of more and mo
re biological molecules were elucidated, and the way they work inferred from countless experiments. The cumulative results show with piercing clarity that life is based on machines\emdash 
machines made of molecules! Molecular machines haul cargo from one place in
 the cell to another along "highways" made of other molecules, while still others act as cables, ropes, and pulleys to hold the cell in shape. Machines turn cellular switches on and off, sometimes killing the cell or causing it to grow. Solar-powered mach
i
nes capture the energy of photons and store it in chemicals. Electrical machines allow current to flow through nerves. Manufacturing machines build other molecular machines, as well as themselves. Cells swim using machines, copy themselves with machinery,
 ingest food with machinery. In short, highly sophisticated molecular machines control every cellular process. Thus the details of life are finely calibrated, and the machinery of life enormously complex.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

ed, functionally and structurally, that it could not survive significant change. He further maintained that each species was created for its own special purpose and each organ for its special function."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But Charles Darwin interpreted fossils differently. He believed that various species descended in stages from a single, common ancestor in a process of evolution and that fossils were proof of this process. 
\par But Darwin's interpretation rests on no proof. On the contrary, in his day, no extant fossils demons
trated evolution. The fossil remains of extinct creatures did not share the kind of family relationship and resemblance that Darwin's theory required. Every known fossil, like every known living thing, possessed its own unique features. As is the case wit
h natural history today, species of the past have not been very similar and close to one another, but rather divided into groups that are very different from one another, with major structural differences between them. 
\par For this reason, Darwin could not use
 fossils to prove his theory. On the contrary, his book proposed "fabricated explanations" to misrepresent this matter that posed such a serious problem for him. He dealt with this matter in the chapter entitled "Difficulties on Theory" and appended to th
e book another chapter titled "On the Imperfection of the Geological Record," that dealt with the absence of intermediate fossil forms. 
\par But in both these chapters, Darwin's problem could be seen clearly. His theory was based on the claim that species came 
into being by a long series of incremental changes. If it were so, intermediate forms must have existed to link one species to another; but no trace of such creatures has been found in the fossil record. 
\par Darwin was finally forced to leave this problem for future researchers. He thought the problem lay in the insufficiency of the fossil record; he was certain that, as new fossils were unearthed, specimens would come to light to prove his theory. He wrote:

 number to carry out excavations in search of the supposed "lost" intermediate forms to extend the fossil record. They made some exciting finds, but over time, it was realized that their excitement was unfounded.
\par One of these "breakthroughs," discovered in 1860 near the German town of Solnhofen, was the fossil to which they gave the name }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Archaeopteryx}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

and claws on its wings. This gave Darwinists a rare opportunity. One of Darwin's most avid defenders, Thomas Huxley, announced that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Archaeopteryx}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  was half-bird and half-reptile. The assumption that its wings weren't suitable for flying led to the conclusio

\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  myth that was to hold sway throughout the 20th century.
\par In time, it was realized that this creature was not a primitive bird; in fact, its skeleton and feather structure made it well adapted to flying. Its reptile-like features were also possessed by some birds of the past and of today.

pouse the theory of evolution. Among these paleontologists, the best known are Stephen J. Gould and Niles Eldridge. These two have proposed a different model of evolution under the name of "punctuated equilibrium," in which they insist that the fossil rec
ord has refuted Darwinism's "gradualism." They have shown in detail that various genera of living things appeared suddenly in the fossil record and remained unchanged for hundreds of millions of years.

he scenario revealed by the fossils from the Cambrian period. Darwin imagined that the history of life on Earth could be represented as a tree starting from one trunk and slowly, gradually separating into various branches. A diagram in }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Origin of the Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 reflected this view. With the aid of this chart, the concept of the evolutionary "tree" was planted in people's minds, to finally become one of Darwinism's most important myths. Various versions of the evolutionary tree were published in textbooks, s
cientific treatises, magazines and newspapers. These diagrams etched in people's minds the idea that living things evolved by small chance changes from one common root of the evolutionary tree. 
\par The truth was quite different, however. This was most clearly
 dramatized with the discovery of the Cambrian explosion at the beginning of the 20th century. In the year 1909, the paleontologist Charles D. Walcott began investigations in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. In the area of the Burgess Pass, he discovered ver
y
 well-preserved strata of shale rock. He quickly realized that the Burgess Shale contained many fossils belonging to the Cambrian period. For the next four years, Walcott carefully collected between 60,000 and 80,000 fossils from the shale and made a note
 of the most subtle differences he discovered among them. 
\par The most amazing thing about the Burgess Shale fossils was that they contained the remains of creatures belonging to all the phyla alive today. (A phylum}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 is the largest taxonomic category used to cl
assify creatures in the animal kingdom. Animals are divided into more than 50 phyla, and each phylum has its own body design. Among the best known phyla are the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Chordata}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  including the vertebrates, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Arthropoda}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

ing all soft-bodied invertebrates with shells.)
\par Walcott was very surprised to see what phyla these fossils belonged to. No significant life had been discovered in much older strata; but the layer he discovered contained creatures belonging to nearly all kn
own phyla, and fossils of hitherto unknown phyla as well. This showed that all the bodily characteristics in the animal kingdom came about at the same time, in the same geological period.
\par This dealt a fatal blow to Darwin's theory. He had proposed that cre
atures had developed slowly and gradually, like the twigs of a tree. According to Darwin's speculations, at first there must have been one single phylum in the world, and different phyla developed slowly, over the course of time. Now, however, this theory
 had to contend with Walcott's proof that all phyla came into being suddenly, at the same time. 
\par But it would be 70 years before this blow turned the theory of the evolutionary tree upside down, because Walcott, at the end of four years of meticulous study,
 decided to keep his fossils a secret instead of revealing them to the scientific world. He was the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. and a staunch Darwinist. Thinking\emdash correctly\emdash 
that the fossils he had discovered would pose a majo
r problem for the theory of evolution, he kept them in the museum's archives rather than releasing them. The Burgess Shale fossils came to light only during an examination of the museum's archives in 1985. The Israeli scientist Gerald Schroeder makes the

Had Walcott wanted, he could have hired a phalanx of graduate students to work on the fossils. But he chose not to rock the boat of evolution. Today fossil representatives of the Cambrian era have been found in China, Africa, the British
 Isles, Sweden, Greenland. The explosion was worldwide. But before it became proper to discuss the extraordinary nature of the explosion, the data were simply not reported. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

. In the 1980s, two new areas of fossil remains similar to the Burgess Shale fossils were discovered: one in Sirius Passet in northern Greenland, and the other in Chengjiang
 in southern China. In both these areas were found fossils of very different creatures that came into being during the Cambrian period. Among these the oldest and best preserved fossils were those found in Chenjiang, which also contained the first vertebr
a
tes. In addition, two 530-million-year-old fish fossils discovered in 1999 proved that all body structures, including the vertebrates, were already in existence during the Cambrian. Investigations showed that the Cambrian explosion occurred within a 10-mi
l
lion-year period, which in geological terms is quite a short time. And the creatures that suddenly appeared in this period all had very complicated organs and had no resemblance with the one-celled and a few multi-celled organisms that preceded them. Step

Evolutionists have tried to explain away the Cambrian explosion in various ways, none of them convincing. All the theses put forward against the Cambrian problem are flawed, which is demonstrated by the arguments that evolution
ists have among themselves. The February 1999 edition of the noted science magazine }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Trends in Genetics}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

It might seem odd that fossils from one small locality, no matter how exciting, should lie at the center of a fierce debate about such broad issues in evolutionary biology. The reason is that animals burst into the fossil record in astonishing profu
sion during the Cambrian, seemingly from nowhere. Increasingly precise radiometric dating and new fossil discoveries have only sharpened the suddenness and scope of this biological revolution. The magnitude of this change in Earth's biota demands an expla

 descended from a common ancestor, Darwin had no proof to back up these claims; he just imagined that there was a family relationship between human beings and apes, animals that, he thought, were physically best suited to being compared to human beings. I
n his book, he developed his racial arguments, claming that some of the world's supposedly "primitive races" were proof of evolution. (However, modern genetics has disproved these racial views shared by Darwin and other evolutionists of the time.)
\par From the 
last quarter of the 19th century, almost a whole science of paleoanthropology devoted itself to the task of finding fossils to prove this imaginary theory of evolution, and many who accepted Darwinism started digging to find the "missing link" between ape
s and human beings.
\par The great discovery they had hoped for was made in England in 1910. For the next 43 years, the skull of "Piltdown Man" was presented to the world as a major evidence of human evolution. The fossil was discovered by Charles Dawson, an ama
teur paleontologist who gave it the name }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Eoanthropus dawsoni.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 It was an odd fossil: the upper part was totally human in structure, while the lower jaw and teeth were like those of an ape. Within a short time, this discovery became famous; and the English w
ere very proud that this fossil, discovered in their native soil, was an ancestor of their race. The considerable size of the cranium was interpreted as an indication that "English intelligence" had evolved very early. In the following years, hundreds of 
theses were written on }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Eoanthropus dawsoni}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
, and the fossil was displayed in the British Museum, where hundreds of thousands of visitors were persuaded as to the "truth of human evolution."
\par They did not know that the "fossil" was a fake. Tests applied in 195
3 showed that Piltdown Man was a combination of bones from a human being and an orangutan. The public was amazed when this fossil, once supposed to be the greatest proof of evolution, was removed from the British Museum exhibit where it had been highlight
ed for decades.
\par In 1922, another scandal occurred in the United States, smaller in scope but just as serious. A molar tooth found in the state of Nebraska was alleged to be an intermediate form between man and ape; and on the basis of this discovery, Nebras
ka Man was concocted. In 1927, however, it was determined that this tooth belonged neither to a human being nor to an ape, but to a wild pig. 
\par In spite of fiascos like this, evolutionists continued their search for human origins. Later, they came to think that extinct apes of the genus }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Australopithecus }{

, with its picture of apes gradually walking on two feet, was officially adopted by textbooks, science periodicals, magazines, daily newspapers, films and even commercials, and was used uncritically for decades.
\par In short, for a long period in the 20th century, the idea was widely accepted that the theory of evolution explained human origins. 
\par However, the reality was quite different. Extant fossils do not harmonize with the evolutionist scheme. And the problem won't be solv
ed by the discovery of more fossils; on the contrary, it will be complicated even further. Some authorities have begun to accept these facts. Among America's prominent paleontologists, Niles Eldredge and Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natura

\par Your DNA data bank contains all of your body's characteristics. This gigantic molecule is composed of a series of four different chemical units called bases. Like a four-letter al
phabet, these bases store the information about all the organic molecules that will construct your body. That is, these chemical building blocks are not arranged randomly, but according to particular information, divided into "sentences" and "paragraphs" 
that scientists call genes. Each gene describes various details of your body\emdash for example, the structure of your eye's transparent cornea, or the formula of the insulin hormone that lets your cells make use of the sugar you eat. 
\par The discovery of DNA is ackn
owledged to be one of the most important in the history of science. In 1953, two young scientists by the name of Francis Crick and James Watson determined this molecule's existence and structure. In the half century since then, a significant part of the s

genome\emdash that is, the totality of all human genes\emdash and took its flawless "inventory." 
\par Of course, the Human Genome Project was to benefit not only medical and genetic engineers, but various professionals in all fields. But an equally, if not more important res

aterialist philosophy claims that everything is just matter; that matter always has been and always will be; and apart from it, there is nothing. In order to solidify their claims, materialists use a kind of logic they call "reductionism," which states th
at things that seem to be immaterial can be explained in terms of material influences.
\par For example, take the example of the human mind, which is not something that can be seen or touched. Moreover, there is no "mind center" in the brain. Inevitably, this leads us to conceive of the mind as something beyond matter. That is, what we call "I"
\emdash the thinking, loving personality able to feel pleasure and pain, that gets upset or happy is not a material object like a table or a stone.
\par However, materialists claim tha
t mind can be reduced to matter. They claim that our ability to think, love, feel regret and all other mental activities are actually products of chemical reactions among the atoms in our brain. When we love someone, it is the influence of neurochemicals 
in certain cells in our brain; if we fear anything, that is due to another chemical reaction. Of this logic, the materialist philosopher Karl Vogt said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

 Bile is a material substance, but there is no proof that a thought is material.
\par Reductionism is a strictly logical operation. But any logical operation may rest on false foundations. One of the important methods in determining if this is so is by appealing to science. For this reason, we must po
se the following question: Can reductionism\emdash the basis of materialist logic\emdash be substantiated in the light of scientific data? 
\par In the 20th century, all scientific investigations, all observations, and the results of all experiments have given a resounding "No" to this question.

Gitt's words state the same conclusions arrived at by the so-called Information Theory, developed within the last few decades to investigate the origin and str
ucture of information in the universe, and accepted as part of thermodynamics. After long research, it arrived at the conclusion that information is different from matter, that it can never be reduced to matter, and that the sources of information and mat
ter must be investigated separately.
\par As we saw earlier, scientists who have investigated DNA's structure have stated that it contains a "magnificent" information. Since this information cannot be reduced to matter, it must originate in a source beyond matter.
\par George C. Williams, one of the pr
oponents of the theory of evolution, admits that most materialists and evolutionists do not want to accept this result. Williams had been a strong advocate of materialism for many years, but states in an article written in 1995 that the materialist (reduc

After this, he states that his observations indicate that a human embryo closely resembles that of an ape, a dog or another vertebrate but that, in later stages of development in the womb, a differentiation occurs. In a letter to his friend, Asa G
ray, Darwin considered the evidence from embryology to be "by far the strongest single class of facts in favor of" his theory.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 54}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But Darwin was no embryologist. Never once did he investigate embryos in a comprehensive way. Therefore, in developing his argu
ments, he quoted individuals whom he regarded as authorities on this matter. In his footnotes, one name was particularly noticeable: the German biologist, Ernst Haeckel, whose book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Naturliche Schopfungsgeschichte}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  (The Natural History of Creation) contained
 various drawings of embryos, together with his comments on them.
\par A short time later, Haeckel was to go down in history as the original author of evolutionist interpretation of embryology. He read }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Origin of the Species }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 (1859) with great excitement, acc
epted what Darwin wrote, and became a more avid evolutionist than Darwin himself. To make his own contribution to the theory, he conducted a series of experiments and published }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Naturliche Schopfungsgeschichte}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  in 1868. In it, he advanced his theory of embry
ology that was to win him fame. From the beginning, he proposed that the embryos of human beings and certain animals developed in the same way. The drawings of the embryos of a human being, an ape and a dog on page 242 were proof of this. The drawings wer
e apparently identical and, according to Haeckel, these creatures came from a common root.
\par In fact, it was the drawings, not these creatures, that came from a common root. Haeckel made a drawing of one embryo and then, after making slight changes to it, pre
sented them together as embryos of a human being, an ape and a dog. When the same drawings were printed side by side, naturally they looked the same.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 55}{\rtlch\fcs1

 However, even before Darwin wrote his book, some noticed a major distortion in Haeckel's "work" and wrote about it. In 1868, L. Rutimeyer published an article in the science periodical }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

Haeckel claims these works to be easy for the scientific layman to follow, as well as scientific and scholarly. No one will quarrel with the first evaluat

Despite this, Darwin and other biologists who supported him continued to accept Haeckel's drawings as a reference. And this encouraged Haeckel to try to make embryology a strong support for Darwinism. His observatio
ns produced no such support, but he regarded his drawings as more important than his observations. In following years, he made a series of comparative drawings of embryos and composed charts comparing the embryos of fish, salamanders, frogs, chickens, rab
b
its and human beings. The interesting thing about these side-by-side charts was that the embryos of these various creatures closely resembled one another, at first, but slowly began to differentiate in the course of their development. Particularly strikin
g
 was the similarity between the embryos of a fish and a human being; so much so that in the drawings, the human embryo had what looked like gills. On the so-called scientific basis of these drawings, Haeckel proclaimed his theory that "Ontogeny recapitula
t
es phylogeny." This slogan represented his belief that in the course of its development, either in the egg or in its mother's womb, every creature repeats the history of its own species, from the beginning. For example, a human embryo first resembles a fi
sh, in later weeks a salamander, then it passes through the reptilian and mammalian stages before "evolving" into a recognizable human being. 
\par The concept conveyed in the slogan "Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny" quickly became known as the "recapitulation 
theory," and in a very short time this myth became one of the most important proofs for evolution. Throughout the 20th century, countless students saw the chart of the human embryo's imaginary progress from fish, through salamander, chicken and rabbit; an
d the myth that the human embryo had gills for a while became an accepted fact. Even today, many supporters of the theory of evolution, if asked, would cite this as one of its proofs. 
\par However, this is pure fabrication. In fact, the embryos of various creat
ures did not at all resemble one another. Haeckel's drawings made all sorts of misrepresentations. To some embryos, he added imaginary organs, removed organs from others, and showed larger and smaller embryos as all the same size.
\par In the human embryo, the 
slits that Haeckel represented as gills were really the beginning of the middle ear canal, the parathyroid, and the thymus glands. Haeckel's other comparisons are also now known to be deceptions; what he made look like a "yolk sac" in the embryo is actual
ly a sac that produces blood for the baby. The structure that Haeckel and his followers called the "tail" was actually the human spine, which resembled a tail only because it formed before the legs did.
\par At the beginning of the 20th century, it came to light that Haeckel had falsified his drawings and he openly confessed to this, saying:
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s21\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid5071365 \rtlch\fcs1 \af444\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0

\par But even while Haeckel's fabrications came to light, another falsification close to that of Haeckel continued to go unnoticed: namely, Darwinism. 
\par As we saw earlier, Darwin discounted other scientists' negative views of Haeckel's interpretative drawings at the time and used them to bolster his own theory. But t
his was not the only point where Darwinism diverged from the truth. Much more striking is that he presented the views of Karl Ernst von Baer\emdash reputedly the most noted embryologist of the time\emdash as distorted. Jonathan Wells' }{\rtlch\fcs1

Darwin cited von Baer as the source of his embryological evidence, but at the crucial point, Darwin distorted that evidence to make it fit his theory. Von Baer lived long enough to obj
ect to Darwin's misuse of his observations, and he was a strong critic of Darwinian evolution until his death in 1876. But Darwin persisted in citing him anyway, making him look like a supporter of the very doctrine of evolutionary parallelism he explicit

In short, Darwin exploited his time's primitive scientific conditions to make false and prejudiced deductions; and took advantage of the limitations in communications in order to distort other scientists' findings.
\par This fact's coming to light\emdash late though it is\emdash is doubtlessly a major blow to Darwinism. Darwin received help from Haeckel's falsifications and portrayed embryology as in favor of his theory.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Oxford University zoology professor Richard Dawkins is one of the well-known evolutionists in the world today. He is known not by his work on zoology, but by his avid championing of Darwinism and atheism. 
\par In 1986, he published his book entitled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Blind Watchmaker,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 in which he tried to persuade readers that living creatures' complex characteristics were the result of natural selection. His attempts were mostly based on speculation, faulty comparisons and w
rong calculations that various scientists and writers have since exposed in detail.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 66}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
\par One of Dawkins' arguments was that of "faulty" or "bad" characteristics in living things. He stated that some structures in living creatures were useless and that, theref
ore, they were faulty, trying to do away with the fact that a flawless creation reigns. The foremost example he gave was the inverted retina in the vertebrate eyes, including the human eye.
\par An inverted retina in the vertebrate eye means that photoreceptors
 are located in the eye backwards, not frontwards where the light enters. The sensory ends of these light-perceiving cells face the back, and the retinal nerves coming out from them form a layer between light and the cells. These nerves converge to a cert
ain point on the retina where they exit the eye. Because there are no photoreceptors at this point, it is the eye's "blind spot," where there is no vision.
\par Darwinists have adopted this inversion and the blind point as flaws; that the eye came to be through natural selection and that such oddities are to be expected. As said earlier, Richard Dawkins is the well-known proponent of this argument. In }{

. . . consideration of the very high energy demands of the photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina suggests that rather than being a challenge to teleology, the curious inverted design of

ut unnoticed by Dawkins, we must first recognize that the retina's photoreceptor cells need a high level of energy and oxygen. While our eyes are open to perceive light, these cells are the locus of very complex chemical reactions every second. Photons, t
he smallest particles of light, are perceived by the cells and, as a result of the highly detailed chemical reactions begun by the photons, perception occurs and is repeated every instant. This reaction is so complex and rapid that, in Denton's words, }{

\par To keep up this high rate of metabolism, of course, the retina cells need a great deal of energy. A human being's retinal cells consume 150% as much oxygen as renal cells, t

The oxygen and nutrients for the voracious metabolic appetite of the photoreceptors are provided by a unique capillary bed, called the choriocapillaris, which is an anatomizing 
network of large and flattened capillaries which form a rich vascular layer situated immediately external to the photoreceptors, separated from them only by the retinal cell epithelial cell layer (RPE) and a special membrane\emdash Bruch's membrane

 form a highly selective barrier which only allows passage into the retina of metabolites and nutrients required for the function of the RPE and photoreceptor cells. These capillaries are much larger than standard capillaries being between 18\endash

\par It is for this reason that the photoreceptors are "inverted." Clearly, there is a strategy here. The inverted arrangement of the retina is not faulty as Dawkins claimed, but is proof of Creation for a specific purpose.
\par In a relevant article, Denton examines whether the retina could have been formed in a different way. 
His conclusion was that it could not. Dawkins' suggestion that the retina should be flat, with the receptor cells facing the light, would distance them from the capillaries that nourish them and in great measure, would rob them of oxygen and nutrients the
y need. Extending the capillaries into the retina layer would not solve the problem, because this would produce many blind spots and reduce the eye's ability to see.

In short, the arguments of Dawkins and other evolutionists that "the vertebrate retina is faulty" derive from ignorance. Their conclusions have been vitiated by more informed and k
nowledgeable investigations of the minutiae of living creatures. Actually, in the history of Darwinism there have been many other arguments arising from ignorance. One is the myth of the "vestigial" organs.

You may have read that the human appendix and coccyx, or tail bone, are vestigial organs that once had important functions in our supposed evolutionary ancestors, but lost those functions over the course of time. 
\par Lots of people have, because ever since Darwin, the myth of the vestigial organs has been the evolutionists' favorite propaganda material.
\par The myth started with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Origin of the Species'}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
 mention of organs whose functions were lost or reduced. Darwin described these organs as "rudimentary" and compared them with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
"the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 74}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  In 1895, the German anatomist R. Wiedersheim proposed a list of about 100 human "vestigial organs," including the appendix and the tail bone.
\par But like other Darwinist claims, this too was a myth that thrived because of the unsophisticated level of science at the time. As research advanced, slowly it came to light that the organs that Darwin and his followers thought to be vestigial actually ha
d important functions, as yet not been determined. With the development of science, it was discovered that Wiedersheim's list of organs had very important functions in the body. As their functions were discovered, the long list of "vestigial" organs grew 
s
teadily shorter. For example, it was discovered that the appendix, long regarded as vestigial, was a very important part of the lymphatic system that fights germs when they enter the body. An article titled "Examples of Bad Design Gone Bad," referring to 
some of the basic literature on anatomy, explains: 
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s21\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid5071365 \rtlch\fcs1 \af444\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0

An examination of the appendix microscopically, shows that it contains a significant amount of lymphoid tissue. Similar aggregates of lymphoid tissue (known as gut-associated lymphoid tissues, GALT) occur 
in other areas of the gastrointestinal system. The GALT are involved in the body's ability to recognize foreign antigens in ingested material. My own research, in particular, is focused on examining the immunological functions of the intestine.
\par Experiments
 in rabbits demonstrate that neonatal appendectomy impairs the development of mucosal immunity. Morphological and functional studies of the rabbit appendix indicate that it is probably the equivalent of the avian bursa in mammals. The bursa plays a critic
a
l role in the development of humoral immunity in birds. The histological and immunohistochemical similarity of the rabbit and human appendix suggest that the human appendix has a similar function to that of the rabbit appendix. The human appendix may be p
a
rticularly important early in life because it achieves its greatest development shortly after birth and then regresses with age, eventually resembling such other regions of GALT as the Peyer's patches in the small intestine. These recent studies demonstra
te that the human appendix is not a vestigial organ, as originally claimed.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 75}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

In short, the reason why the appendix was famously thought to be vestigial was the dogmatism of Darwin and his followers, thanks in turn to the unsophisticated level of science of
 their time. With the primitive microscopes at their disposal, they could not observe the lymphatic tissue of the appendix; and because they could not understand its structure, they regarded it as useless and included it on their list of functionless vest
igial organs. Once more, Darwinism was abetted by the unsophisticated level of 19th-century science.
\par This situation also pertained to all the other organs on Wiedersheim's list. As years went on, the tonsils that were thought to be vestigial were discovered
 to have an important role in protecting the throat from infection, especially before adulthood. It became known that the tail bone at the base of the spinal column supported the bones around the pelvis and therefore, if it were not for it, an individual 
could not sit comfortably. In addition, this bone was understood to be the point at which the organs and muscles of the pelvic region were held together.
\par In subsequent years, it was found that the thymus, thought to be vestigial, activates the T-cells and s
ets the body's immune system into operation; that the pineal gland is responsible for the secretion of essential hormones such as melatonin that controls production of the luteinizing hormone; that the thyroid gland ensures a balanced development of the i
n
fant and plays a role in setting the body's metabolic rate; and that the pituitary gland ensures the correct functioning of several hormonal glands such as the thyroid, the adrenals and the reproductive glands, as well as controlling the skeletal developm
ent.
\par The semi-lunar fold in the corner of the eye that Darwin called vestigial was shown to help clean and lubricate the eye. 
\par Today, it has been determined that the organs claimed to be vestigial in past years all have definite functions. In their book titled }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

\par Accordingly, it is accepted that the myth of vestigial organs subscribed to by so many evolutionists is an argument based on ignorance. In "Do 'Vestigial Organs' Provide Evidence for Evolution?," an article in the magazine }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22

The beginning of this chapter invalidated Richard Dawkins' claim that the vertebrate retina is faulty. Another evolutionist, supporting the s
ame ideas, is the late Stephen J. Gould, a paleontologist at Harvard University. Before his death in 2002, he had become one of America's leading evolutionists.
\par Like Dawkins, Gould also wrote about an example of "faulty" characteristics\emdash the thumb of the panda.
\par Unlike a human hand, a panda does not have an opposable thumb apart from its other four fingers that lets it hold objects easily. Its five digits extend out side by side. But besides these five parallel digits, there is also a projection in its wrist 
called the "radial sesamoid bone." The panda sometimes uses this bone as a finger, and so biologists call it the panda's thumb. 
\par Gould claimed that this bone in the panda's hand was non-functional. Gould was so convinced of the importance of his thesis that in 1980, he published a book on the subject. 
\par Like Dawkins' claim, however, Gould's thesis of faulty characteristic was also wrong. Gould's error lay in comparing the panda's hand with that of a human, assuming that the panda's thumb had the same functio
n. On this matter, Paul Nelson makes the following comment:

In short, the claims made by evolutionists over the past 150 years of "vestigial organs" and "faulty" biological characteristics have all been proved false by closer investigations of the structures in question.
\par Evolutionists cannot account for the origins of any biological structure in nature, and their objections to explaining these structures in terms of the fact of Creation have been shown to be invalid. 
\par For that reason we can say that there was once such a thing as Darwinism, which claimed that living things were full of "faulty" or "vestigial" organs.
\par Today, this theory has been discredited by scientific evidence.

but recently discredited\emdash concept of "junk" DNA. 
\par In the second half of the 20th century, as we saw in the last chapter, the myth of vestigial organs began to collapse. Organs formerly thought to be useless turned out to have important functions, and the my
th became untenable. But evolutionists, not wanting to do without the propaganda this myth afforded, embraced a new version of it, which claimed that some of the genes containing the organs' genetic code but not the organs themselves\emdash 
were vestigial. The new concept that replaced "vestigial" organs was "junk" DNA.
\par This term "junk" referred to some sections of the huge DNA molecule in which is encoded all of a living creature's genetic data. According to evolutionist claims, a large part of DNA is now non-fun
ctional. These parts did have a function in the so-called past, but in time, after the alleged evolutionary changes, they became vestigial\emdash 
in short, "junk." The parallel with Darwinism was quite clear, and in a short time, the concept of junk DNA became on
e of the most repeated terms in scientific literature. But this new version of the myth did not have a long lifespan. Especially with the announcement of the results of the Human Genome Project in 2001, it was more and more loudly proclaimed in the scient
i
fic world that the whole concept was wrong, because the functions of so-called junk DNA were slowly being understood. Evan Eichler, an evolutionist scientist from the University of Washington, admitted that "The term 'junk DNA' is a reflection of our igno
rance."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 81}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 \tab

\par This giant molecular chain within the cells of living creatures is often referred to as a data bank, because of the genetic information it contains. At the same time, this molecule contains a genetic code that directs how this data is employed in the body
'
s activities. As detailed in the previous chapters, every evolutionist's attempt to explain the origin of the DNA molecule has been unsuccessful, and it's been established that the data it contains could not have come into existence at random. The DNA mol
ecule is clearly an example of a superior Creation.
\par The special parts of DNA encoding our physical characteristics and physiological activities are called genes, which play a role in the synthesis of various proteins and ensure that we survive. But the tota
lity of our genes makes up only about 10% of our DNA. The remaining 90% is known as "non-coding DNA" because it does not direct the production of any proteins.
\par Non-coding DNA can be categorized into some sub-groups. Sometimes, it's found squeezed between g
enes and is called an intron. Another kind, called repetitive DNA, is formed by repeated nucleotide sequences extending the length of the chain. If the nucleotides on non-coding DNA were arranged in a way similar to the complex series in a gene, instead o
f in a repetitive series, they would be called a pseudogene.
\par Evolutionists have lumped these non-protein-coding segments of DNA under the general heading of "junk DNA" and asserted that they are unnecessary leftovers in the so-called process of evolution. H
owever, this endeavor has clearly been illogical: Just because these DNA segments do not code for proteins does not imply that they have no function. In order to determine these functions, we have to await the results of scientific experiments to be done 
o
n them. But evolutionist prejudice, with its longstanding misleading claims about junk DNA, has kept this logic from becoming disseminated in the public domain. In the past 10 years especially, research has shown that evolutionists are wrong and their cla
ims imaginary. The non-coding part of DNA is not "junk" as the evolutionists claim, but on the contrary, is now accepted as a "genomic treasure." }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 82}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

In the past few years, another important role played by non-coding DNA has been discovered: It is absolutely necessary for the structure and functioning of chromosomes. Studies have shown that non-
coding DNA provides the structure that lets DNA perform various functions\emdash 
which it cannot in the absence of a formed structure. Scientists observed that elimination of a telomere (the DNA-protein complexes at both ends of chromosomes that grow smaller after cell division) from a yeast chromosome caused a cell cycle arrest.}{

 all shown that the concept of junk DNA was an evolutionist error based on lack of knowledge. Non-coding DNA, like introns interrupting the sequence of genes and repetitive DNA found as longer sequences, have been shown to be functional. There was only on
e kind of non-coding DNA left whose functionality was unknown: pseudogenes.

 means "false, deceptive." Evolutionists gave the name "pseudogene" to a DNA segment produced by a functional gene that had apparently undergone a mutation and los
t its functionality. Pseudogenes have a special significance for evolutionists, who covertly acknowledge that mutations cannot bring about evolution and have resorted to pseudogenes as a means to deceive people.
\par Countless experiments on living things have 
shown that mutations always result in a loss of genetic data. Just as a few random blows with a hammer will not lead to improvements in the running of a clock, mutations have never led to the development of new organisms, or cause existing ones to evolve.
 Although the theory of evolution requires an increase in genetic data, mutations always reduce and destroy them.
\par Evolutionists, lacking even a single demonstrable mechanism to support their theory, presented pseudogenes as by-products of a phantom mechanis
m functioning in an imaginary evolutionary process. They claimed that these allegedly useless DNA segments were molecular "fossils" of so-called evolution. Their only support for this claim was the lack of knowledge as to whether these genes had any real 
function.

ion such as he proposed has ever been observed, and no satisfactory explanation has ever been provided for the origin of species.
\par To explain this, it will be useful to examine what sort of "speciation" Darwin envisioned.
\par His theory depended on the observat
ion of variations in the animal populations. Some of these observations were made by individuals who bred animals, raising quality breeds of dogs, cows or pigeons. From among the population, they selected ones with a desirable characteristic (for example,
 
dogs that could run fast, cows that produced good milk or "smart" pigeons), and bred them. Within a few generations, their resulting offspring had a high proportion of the selected qualities. For example, the cows produced much more milk than ordinary cow
s.
\par This kind of "limited variation" made Darwin think that modification is continual in nature, and when it is extended over a long enough period of time, it produces a radical change, that is, evolution. 
\par Darwin's second observation along these lines was t
hat the various breeds of finches he saw in the Galapagos Islands had differently-shaped bills than finches on the mainland. In the islands, long-billed, short-billed, curved-billed and straight-billed strains of finches developed in the same population. 
Darwin concluded that these varieties turned into separate species by mating among themselves.
\par When Darwin assembled all these instances of variation, he was led to think that unlimited modification occurred in nature and that to develop brand-new species, orders and classes, only a long period of time was required. But Darwin was wrong.
\par When individuals with a given dominant characteristic are selected and bred, only better and stronger members of that species are produced. But thi
s selective breeding can't possibly produce a different species. For example, a horse cannot descend from a cat, nor a giraffe from a gazelle, or a plum from a pear. Peaches do not turn into bananas nor do carnations turn into roses. In short, under no co
nditions can one species arise from another. The following pages will detail how Darwin was wrong on this matter.

That populations of living organisms may change in their anatomy, physiology, genetic structure, etc., over a period of time is beyond question. What remains elusive is the answer to the question, How much c
hange is possible, and by what genetic mechanism will these changes take place? Plant and animal breeders can marshal an impressive array of examples to demonstrate the extent to which living systems can be altered. But when a breeder begins with a dog, h

\par 1) No new genetic data can be obtained without external interference in the genes of organisms. Without such interference, new biological data cannot appear in nature. That is, new species, new organs, and new structures cannot come into being. It is
 only "genetic variation" that occurs naturally in a given species. These limited alterations include the development of, for example, shorter, larger, short-haired or long-haired breeds of dogs. Even given a million years, these variations will never pro
duce new species or higher taxa (genera, families, orders, classes, phyla).
\par 2) In nature, external interference with the genes of organisms comes about only through mutations. But these mutations are never beneficial nor produce new genetic data; they only destroy the existing one.
\par Therefore, it is impossible to explain the "origin of species" in terms of natural selection, as Darwin thought to do. No matter how much "selection" dogs are subjected to, they will always remain dogs; there is no sense in assert
ing that they were actually fish or bacteria in the past.
\par So, what of the "external interference" in the genes, or mutations?
\par Since the 1930s the Darwinist theory has relied on this alternative, and for this reason, the theory's name was changed to "neo-Darwinism." However, mutations were not able to rescue the theory\emdash an important topic to examine separately.}{

The various finches that Darwin observed in the Galapagos were an example of variation and, as with other examples, offered no definite proof for evolution. Observations made in the last few years have shown that finches have not undergone the kind of lim

tless alteration that Darwin's theory supposed. Moreover, most of the different types of finches, which Darwin thought to represent 14 separate species, were actually variations of the same species, able to mate with one another. Scientific observations h
a
ve shown that the example of the finch's bill, cited by almost all evolutionist literature, is actually an example of variation which affords no proof for the theory of evolution. Peter and Rosemary Grant went to the Galapagos to look for proof for the so

\par The best evidence that mutat
ions do not produce new genetic data is that of the fruit fly. Mutations done to fruit flies show that in nature, balance, not change, dominates organisms. Thanks to the fast gestation period of fruit flies, which lasts only 12 days, for years they have b
e
en the favorite subject of mutation experiments. In order to increase the mutation rate by 15,000 percent, X-rays were used in these experiments. Scientists could observe fruit flies that, in a short time, were subjected to the number of mutations they wo
uld be exposed to for millions of years under natural conditions. But even such rapid mutations produced no new species. Scientists were not able to obtain any new genetic data. 
\par In fruit flies, the classic case of supposed "beneficial mutation" is the inst
ance of the four-winged mutant. Normally, fruit flies have two wings, but some with four wings have hatched occasionally. Darwinist literature offers this example as a "development," but as Jonathan Wells has shown in detail in his }{\rtlch\fcs1

 interpretation is wrong. These extra wings have no muscles for flying and so are actually disadvantages to the fruit fly. And not one of these mutants has survived outside a laboratory.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Despite all this, evolutionists assert that beneficial instances 
of mutation do occur, even if rarely; and that through natural selection, new biological structures come into being. However, this is a major error. A mutation certainly brings about no increase in genetic data and, therefore, does not foster evolution. A
s Lester and Bohlin explain:

Mutations will be capable only of modifying what already exists, usually in a meaningless or deleterious way. That is not to say that beneficial mutation is prohibited; unexpected maybe, but not impossible. A beneficial mutatio
n is simply one that makes it possible for its possessors to contribute more offspring to future generations than do those creatures that lack the mutation. . . But these mutations have nothing to do with changing one kind of organism into another. . .

\par In 
this regard, Darwin called attention to the wingless beetles of Madeira. For a beetle living on a windy island, wings can be a definite disadvantage. Mutations causing the loss of flight are definitely beneficial. Similar would be the case of sightless ca
v
efish. Eyes are quite vulnerable to injury, and a creature that lives in total darkness would benefit from mutations reducing their vulnerability. While these mutations produce a drastic and beneficial change, it is important to notice that they always in
volve loss, never gain. One never observes wings or eyes being produced in species that did not previously possess them.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 114}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

Therefore, Lester and Bohlin conclude that overall, mutations are always a cause of genetic impairment and degeneration.
\par Mutations al
ways cause a loss of genetic data; to believe that they produced the extraordinarily complex genetic codes of the millions of different species is like believing that books falling randomly onto a computer keyboard have written millions of encyclopedias. 
It is unthinkable nonsense. Dr. Merle d'Aubigne, head of the Orthopedic Department at the University of Paris, makes this important comment:

The attempt to explain the origin of species in terms of evolution has come to an impasse, as has been openly admitted by evolutionists over the past few years. The situation is summed up in a 1996 article by evolutionist biologists Gilbert, Opitz and Raf
f in the magazine, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Developmental Biology}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 . They write: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "the origin of species\emdash Darwin's problem\emdash remains unsolved."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 116}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  
\par But the man in the street is not aware of this situation. The Darwinist system prefers not to let the public know that in Darwin's terms, th
e question of the origin of species is unanswerable. Instead, through media and textbooks, it repeats the myths of evolution. In the world of science, these myths are called "just-so stories" and constitute the main source of motivation for those who acce
pt the theory. 
\par You will find one of the most familiar of these stories\emdash about how humans came to walk on two feet\emdash in almost every evolutionist text, with slight variations: Humanoid primates that were the ancestors of human beings lived among the trees in t
he African jungles. Their spines were stooped, and their hands and feet ideally shaped for clinging onto branches. Africa's jungle expanses later shrank, and humanoids migrated to the savannah. In order to be able to see above the savannah's tall grasses,
 
they needed to stand upright, in other words on their feet. Thus it was that our ancestors came to stand and walk erect. Their hands were now off the ground; and as a result they began using their hands to make tools. The more they used their hands, the m
ore their intelligence grew. They thus turned into human beings. 
\par You can often find stories like this in evolutionist newspapers and magazines. Reporters who accept the theory of evolution, or whose knowledge of it is limited or superficial, relate these s
tories to their readers as if they were factual. However, more and more scientists proclaim that they have no scientific value. Dr. Collin Patterson, for years the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London, writes:

forces promoted leaping, then gliding, and eventually powered flight from branch to branch and tree to tree. Absolutely none of these suppositions about the intermediate forms, the ecological conditions they lived in, or the selective forces to which they

that "just-so stories" cannot be tested and therefore have no scientific value\emdash 
is only one aspect of the problem. A second, perhaps more important, aspect is that apart from the fact that these stories have no scientific support, they are impossible nonsense. 
\par To explain why, let us return to the story of the "hominoids that started to walk on two feet." 
\par Jean Baptiste Lamarck invented this myth in the unsophisticated scientific world of 150 years ago. However, modern genetics has shown that a characteristic acquired over a lifetime is not passed down to the next generation. T
he relevance of this lies in the supposition that the so-called ancestors of human beings }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 evolved}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  with characteristics they had acquired during their lifetime. This scenario claims that hominoids stood up on their hind feet to see above the vegetation, fre
eing their hands for use, and as a result, their intelligence developed. Nothing of this sort ever happened. Besides, it is not possible for a creature to acquire characteristics simply by trying to stand up straight and by using hand tools. Even if we ac
c
ept the possibility of such acquisition (which is scientifically impossible), these skills cannot be passed on to the next generation. Therefore, even if the impossible did take place and one ape could force its skeleton into an upright position, it could
 not pass on this habit to its offspring, and evolution would not occur.
\par So, why is this Lamarckian idea, discredited for more than a century, still trying to impose itself on society?
\par Evolutionists say that these "just-so stories" encapsulate an actual pro
cess of biological evolution. They do not believe that necessity gives birth to evolution, but that necessity guides natural selection in a particular direction. They also believe that it causes the selection of the mutations that will bring about results
 
in that direction. That is, when they maintain that hominoids stood up on two feet, they are actually saying that it would have been advantageous for them to stand on two feet. Some stood up straight, with a skeleton that had mutated at just the right tim
e; and those that stood up straight were chosen by natural selection.
\par In other words, the scientific explanations relevant to the mutation are completely ignored, because if these details are examined, it will appear that they are merely unscientific superstitions. 
\par The evolutionists' just-so stories suppose that mutations will appear to supply whatever an organism needs and to ensure whatever advantages would suit it best. 
\par Moreover, no mutation has been observed so far that develops genetic data. 
\par To believe in this scenario is like believing in a magic wand that supplies a creature's every need. It is superstition. 
\par Even though the French zoologist Pierre-Paul Grass\'e9 theoretically accepts evolution, he is aware of the reality of the situation and has come out strongly against Darwinism in describing its strange belief about mutations: 
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s21\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid5071365 \rtlch\fcs1 \af444\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0

The opportune appearance of mutations permitting animals and plants to meet their needs seems hard to believe. Yet the Darwinian theory is even
 more demanding. A single plant, a single animal would require thousands and thousands of . . . appropriate events. Thus, miracles would become the rule: events with an infinitesimal probability could not fail to occur. . .\~

These statements are very important because in future, you will probably encounter such "just-so stories" in evolutionist literature and especially in the media. Remember, the
se vain stories rest on no scientific proof. The same method is always used in their production. First, the advantage of a creature's particular characteristic or aspect is described, then a scenario is invented to show how this advantage could have evolv
e
d. In practice, of course, there's no limit to the evolutionist theses that could be produced in this way: "The trunk gives the elephant the ability to gather food from the ground, so it must have evolved for that purpose," or "The giraffe's neck enables 
it to reach higher branches so it must have evolved to let the animal do so." To accept this is to believe that nature looks after the needs of its every creature. That is, it is the same as believing a myth.
\par The nature of this myth is becoming clearer and clearer every day. 
\par Reviewing what we've examined since the beginning of this chapter, claiming that the origin of species is a random evolutionary process was the result of wrong deductions Darwin made in the scientifically unsophisticated 19th century. E
very 20th-century observation and experiment shows that no mechanism in nature produces new species, much less higher taxa of living things.
\par Now that science has destroyed the Darwinist error, it has come to light that the true origin of species lies in Creation. Almighty God, with His supreme knowledge, has created every living creature.

\par When Darwin was proposing his theory, there were no intermediate forms to support it, but he hoped that some would be dis
covered in the future. To remedy this vital deficiency, paleontologists who believed in Darwinism put together a set of horse fossils found in North America to form a sequence. Despite the fact that there appeared to be no intermediate forms in the fossil
 record, the Darwinists thought that they had come up with a great success.
\par One of the most important pieces of this sequence had already been discovered before Darwinism. In 1841, the English paleontologist Sir Richard Owen found a fossil belonging to a sm
all mammal and, inspired by its similarity to the hyrax, a small fox-like creature found in Africa, he called it }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Hyracotherium}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 . The hyrax's skeleton was almost identical to Owen's finding, except for its skull and the tail.
\par As they did with other fossils, paleontologists who adopted Darwinism began to evaluate }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Hyracotherium}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  from an evolutionist point of view. In 1874, the Russian paleontologist Vladimir Kovalevsky tried to establish a relationship between }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Hyracotherium}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  and horses. In 1879, two well-known ev
olutionists of the time carried this enterprise further and compiled the horse series which was to remain on the Darwinist agenda for years to come. The American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, together with Thomas Huxley (known as Darwin's bulldog)
, devised a chart by arranging some hoofed fossils according to tooth structure and the number of toes in foreleg and hind leg. In the process, to stress the idea of evolution, Owen's }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 and laid the foundation of the sequence that would be displayed for years in museums and textbooks as supposed proof of the evolution of today's horse.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 122}{\rtlch\fcs1

\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 .
\par In the next century, this sequence was taken to be proof for the so-called evolution of the horse. The decrease in the number o
f toes and the animal's gradual increase in size were enough to convince evolutionists, who for some decades hoped to assemble similar fossil sequences for other creatures. But their hopes were never fulfilled: They were never able to assemble a sequence 
for other creatures, as they supposedly had for the horse. 
\par Moreover, some contradictions became evident, with the attempt to insert newly-excavated fossils into the horse series. Characteristics of the new finds\emdash where they were discovered, their age, the number of toes\emdash 
were incompatible with the sequence and began to undo it. They were inconsistent with the horse series and turned it into a meaningless assortment of fossils.

The family tree of the horse is beautiful and continuous only in the textbooks. In the reality provided by the results of research it is put together f

Today, even many evolutionists reject the thesis that horses went through a gradual evolution. In November, 1980, a four-day symposium was held at the Fiel
d Museum of Natural History in Chicago attended by 150 evolutionists. It dealt with the problems associated with the theory of a gradual evolution. A speaker, the evolutionist Boyce Rensberger, told that there was no proof in the fossil record for the sce
nario of the gradual evolution of the horse, and that there never was any such process:

The popularly told example of horse evolution, suggesting a gradual sequence of changes from four-toed, or fox-like creatures, living nearly 50 million years ago, to to
day's much larger one-toe horse, has long been known to be wrong. Instead of gradual change, fossils of each intermediate species appear fully distinct, persist unchanged, and then become extinct. Transitional forms are unknown.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

aylor, Nilsson and Rensberger, we can understand that there is no scientific support for the supposed evolution of horses, and that the sequence is full of contradictions. So, if there is no proof for the horse series, what is it based on? The answer is e
vident: As with all other Darwinist scenarios, the horse series is imaginary; evolutionists assembled some fossils according to their own preconceptions and gave the public the impression that the creatures had evolved from one another.
\par Marsh can be called the architect of the horse series, and there is no doubt that he played a role on creating this impression. Almost a century later, Marsh's "technique" was described by the evolutionist Robert Milner, who said that "}{\rtlch\fcs1

their size. But contrary to expectations, the new fossils upset Marsh's scenario. The ecologist Garret Hardin says:

\par Interestingly, O.C. Marsh himself mentioned the existence of three-toed horses living in southwestern America at that time and that in this respect, they resembled the extinct }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  The inconsistency of the horse series lies not only in the fact that a genera existed in the same time and place as the so-called "ancestor" from which it claimed linear descent. No isolated area of th
e world can be taken by itself as evidence that horses came to be through an evolutionary process. Evolutionists have assembled fragments of fossils from different continents according to their preconceptions and used to corroborate their claims. However,
 this methodology does not accord with objective science.
\par While assembling the horse series, evolutionists relied on the fossils' number of toes and the size and structure of the teeth\emdash but this procedure turned against them. In arranging their sequence, the
y claimed that the horse's supposed ancestors went from feeding on bushes to feeding on grass, and that their teeth evolved accordingly. But from studies made on 5-million-year-old teeth belonging to six different species of horses, Bruce MacFadden demons
trated that these creatures' teeth did not really undergo any change.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 133}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  
\par On the other hand, an up-and-down variation can be seen in the number of ribs and lumbar vertebrae in the sequence, which is the exact opposite of what evolution would predict. For ex
ample, in the supposed evolutionary horse series, the number of ribs increased from 15 to 19, and later decreased to 18. In the so-called ancestors, the number of lumbar vertebrae went from six to eight, then back to six. These structures have a critical 
influence on these animals' movement and even their lives. Logically, a species whose vital structures undergo random variations clearly cannot perpetuate itself.
\par A final inconsistency in the horse series is the evolutionist assumption that an observed incr
ease in a creature's size represents evolutionary "progress." Looking at the size of modern-day horses, we can see that this makes no sense. The largest modern-day horse is the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  Despite the large variations in size in today's horses, evolutionists' past attempts to sequence horses according to their size was foolish indeed. 
\par In short, the whole horse series is clearly an evolutionist myth based on prejudice. It has been left to the evolutionist paleontologists\emdash the silent witnesses of Darwinism's collapse\emdash 
to make this known. Since Darwin's time, they have known that there were no fossil layers of intermediate forms. In 2001, Ernst Mayr said, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
"Nothing has more impressed the paleontologists than the discontinuous nature of the fossil record," }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 135}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  expressing the longstanding disappointment among paleontologists that the countless intermediate forms that Darwin envisioned have never been found. 
\par Perhaps for this reason, paleontologists have been speaking for decades about the invalidity of the horse series, even though other evolutionists continue to defend it avidly. In 1979, for example, David Raup said that the horse series was totally meaning
less and invalid:

The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record, such
 as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be modified or discarded as a result of more detailed information. What appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and l

About 20 years ago, an evolutionist paleontologist Dr. Niles Eldredge from one of the world's most famous museums, the American Museum of Natural History, confessed that evolutionist claims 
about the horse series diagrams displayed in his own museum were imaginary. Eldredge criticized assertions that this speculative series was valid enough to be included in textbooks.

museums around the world exhibit the horse series and tell visitors the tale that horses are an evolved species. Ironically, one of the gravest errors in scientific history is displayed in buildings intended to acquaint people with real science and raise 
their appreciation of its accuracy. What visitors see there is just a Darwinist myth that was discredited decades ago.

\par A horse's leg is evidence of Creation. Pierre-Paul Grass\'e9 explains the characteristics of a horse's hoof in technical language, then goes on to show that this continuity could not have been brought about by any ra

 The horny wall, by its vertical keratophyl laminae, is fused with the podophyl laminae of the keratogenous layer. The respective lengths of the bones, their mode of articulation, the curves and shapes of the articular surfaces, the structure of bones (or

entation, arrangement of the bony layers), the presence of ligaments, tendons sliding with sheaths, buffer cushions, navicular bone, synovial membranes with their serous lubricating liquid, all imply a continuity in the construction which random events, n

's statements clearly show the perfect structure of a horse's leg. Even more is known today about it, as a recent study reveals. 
\par In a 2002 study, researchers from the University of Florida discovered that one pa
rticular bone in a horse's leg (the third metacarpus bone) had unique properties. As revealed by this study, there was a hole, the size of a pea through which blood vessels could enter, on one side of the bone. Naturally holes cause weaknessess. In labora
t
ory stress tests, however, contrary to ordinary expectations, the bone didn't break near the hole. Further analysis showed that the bone was arranged in such a way as to push stress into a stronger region, preventing the horse's leg from breaking at that 
point. This structure attracted so many admirers that NASA financed Andrew Rapoff, an assistant professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering, to imitate it in the aircrafts near the holes for wiring.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The structure of a horse's leg surpasses the inventiveness of engineers trained in the most advanced technology; and is now mimicked by the aircraft industry. As Grass\'e9
 pointed out, such special structures cannot be explained in terms of random occurrences. Plainly, the horse's leg has superior character
istics that cannot come into being by coincidence; that is, horses came into being with all their characteristics by God's superior Creation. In conclusion, the horse series presented as fact in the 20th-century evolutionist literature has been discredite
d. Horses show no evidence of evolution, but their complex anatomy is an important example of the fact of Creation. 
\par So, Darwinism's myth of horse evolution, like its other myths, has been discredited.

\par In 19th-century England, the dark moths became prevalent, and this coloration was given the name }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 melanism}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
. Based on this, Darwinists composed a myth that they would use consistently for at least a century, claiming that it was a most important proof of evolution at work. This myth found its place in nearly all biology textbooks, en
cyclopedia articles, museums, media coverage and documentary films about Darwinism. 
\par The myth's narrative can be summed up as follows: At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, in Manchester and other predominantly industrial areas, the bark on the tr
ees was light in color. For this reason, darker, melanic moths landed on these trees could easily be seen by the birds that preyed on them, so that their life expectancy was very short. But 50 years later, as a result of industrial pollution, the light-co
l
ored lichens that lived on bark died off and the bark itself became blackened by soot. Now predators could easily spot the light-colored moths. As a result, the number of light-colored moths decreased, while the dark-colored melanic forms, harder to notic
e on the trees, survived to reproduce.
\par Evolutionists resorted to the deception that this process was a major proof for their theory; and that over time, light-colored moths had "evolved" into a darker-colored type. According to Darwinist literature, this was evolution in action.
\par Today, however, like the other classic Darwinist myths, this one has been discredited. In order to understand why, we must look at how the story developed.

 appeared and multiplied in England because of the Industrial Revolution began to be discussed even while Darwin was alive. In the first half of the 20th century, it remained current only as an opinion, because there was not a single scientific experiment
 
or observation to prove it. In 1953, H.B.D. Kettlewell, a Darwinist medical doctor and amateur biologist, decided to conduct a series of experiments to supply the missing proof, and went out into the English countryside, the habitat of peppered moths. He 
released a similar number of light and dark peppered moths and observed how many of each type the birds preyed. He determined that more dark-colored moths were taken by predators from the light lichen-covered trees.
\par In 1959, Kettlewell published his findings in an article entitled "Darwin's Missing Evidence" in the evolutionist magazine }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Scientific American}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

raphs showing Kettlewell's moths on tree trunks were published everywhere. At the beginning of the 1960s, Kettlewell's story was written into every textbook and would influence the minds of biology students for four decades.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
\par So, in the scientific argument, what facts became clear?
\par Another American writer and biologist, Jonathan Wells, has written on this subject in detail. His book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Icons of Evolution}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  devotes a special chapter to this myth. He says that Bernard Kettlewell's study, regarded as experimental proof, is basically a scientific scandal. Here are some of its basic elements: 
\par  Many studies made after Kettlewell's experiments showed that only on
e type of these moths rested on tree trunks; all the other types preferred the underside of horizontal branches. Since the 1980s, it has become widely accepted that moths rarely rest on tree trunks. Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael Majerus, Tony Lie
bert, Paul Brakefield, as well as other scientists have studied this subject over 25 years. They conclude that in Kettlewell's experiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test results could not be accepted as scientific. 
\par  Researchers wh
o tested Kettlewell's experiment came to an even more striking conclusion: In less polluted areas of England, one would have expected more light-colored moths, but the dark ones were four times as many as the light ones. In other words, contrary to what K
ettlewell claimed and nearly all evolutionist literature repeated, there was no correlation between the ratio in the moth population and the tree trunks.
\par  As the research deepened, the dimensions of the scandal grew: The moths on tree trunks photographed by
 Kettlewell were actually dead. He glued or pinned the dead moths to tree trunks, then photographed them. In truth, because moths actually rested underneath the branches, it was not possible to obtain a real photo of moths on tree trunks.}{\rtlch\fcs1

\par Only in the l
ate 1990s, the scientific world was able to learn these facts. When the myth of the Industrial Melanism that had been a feature in biology courses for decades came to such an end, evolutionists were disappointed. One of them, Jerry Coyne, said he felt ver
y dismayed when he learned of the fabrications with regard to the peppered moths.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 146}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

How was this myth invented? Judith Hooper explains that Kettlewell, and other Darwinists who made up the evolutionist story of the peppered moth
s with him, distorted the evidence in their desire to find proof for Darwinism (and become famous in the process). In so doing, they deceived themselves:

However, the same moth lives in North America, where no melanism has been observed despite the Industrial Revolution and the air pollution. Hooper explains this situation referring to the findings of Theodore David Sargent, an American scientist who studi
ed the question:

n Canada, Pittsburgh, and around New York City . . . and in Sargent's view, the North American data falsify the classical industrial melanism hypothesis. This hypothesis predicts a strong positive correlation between industry (air pollution, darkened back
grounds) and the incidence of melanism. "But this was not true," Sargent points out, "in Denis Owen's original surveys\emdash which showed the same extent of melanism wherever sampled, whether city or rural area\emdash

\par Within the last ten years, dinosaurs with avian 
feathers, or imaginary "dino-birds," have been one of the Darwinist media's favorite pieces of propaganda. A series of headlines about dino-birds, reconstruction drawings, and persistent explanations from evolutionist "experts" persuaded many that half-bi
rd, half-dinosaur creatures once existed.
\par The last, most exhaustive defense of this premise was undertaken by Richard O. Prum and Alan Brush, both well-known ornithologists, in the March 2003 issue of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
Scientific American}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 . In their article, "The Feather or t
he Bird? Which Came First?", Prum and Brush were assertive, as if to finally put an end to the on-going arguments as to the origin of birds. They claimed that their findings had led them to a supposedly amazing conclusion: Feathers had evolved in dinosaur
s, before birds came into existence. Feathers, they proposed, had evolved not for the purpose of flying, but for insulation, impermeability to water, to attract the opposite gender, camouflage, and defense. Only later were they used for flight.

One person whose views may be consulted on this matter is one of the recognized authorities in the world on the origin of birds: D
r. Alan Feduccia of the Biology Department of the University of North Carolina. He accepts the theory that birds came into existence through evolution, but he differs from Prum and Brush and other proponents of the "dino-bird" in thinking that the theory 
of evolution is not clear on this matter. He refuses to give any credence to the hype over the dino-bird, deliberately presented as a fact, without evidence.
\par He wrote an article in the October 2002 issue of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 The Auk}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
, a periodical published by the American Or
nithologists' Union and which serves as a forum for highly technical discussions of ornithology. His article, "Birds are Dinosaurs: Simple Answer to a Complex Problem," explains that the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs, avidly supported ever sinc
e
 John Ostrom first proposed it in the 1970s, rested on no scientific evidence. Feduccia also gave a detailed account of how such a theory was impossible, and explained a very important fact concerning the dino-birds said to have been found in China: It is
 not clear that the structures found on the fossil reptiles, presented as feathered dinosaurs, are feathers at all. On the contrary, there is much evidence that this so-called "dino-fuzz" has no relation to feathers. Feduccia writes:

Another interesting point is that all the fossil "feathered dinosaurs" were found in China. How could these fossils have come to light in China, but nowhere else in the world? And why weren't any feathers or feather shafts found on these din
osaurs, claimed by evolutionists to be feathered, in these Chinese formations that could so well preserve even such a structure as the dino-fuzz? The answer is plain: It's because they didn't possess any avian feathers. Feduccia writes:

 in the above extract is one of the fossils portrayed as a supposed intermediate form in the myth
 of birds evolving from dinosaurs. Like the others, however, this is nothing more than biased evolutionist interpretation. The feathers seen in the imaginary reconstructions of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Velociraptor }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 merely reflect evolutionists' imaginations; the fact is that there
 is no evidence the animal had feathers at all. In addition, again as we have seen in the above quotation, evolutionists manifestly distort the results from the fossil record according to their own theories. The only reason for supposing that a species, w
ith a 70-million-year-old fossil, actually existed 170 million years earlier\emdash and establishing an evolutionary family relationship on the basis of that supposition\emdash is to distort the facts. 
\par Cladistics is a covert confession that the theory of evolution cannot cope with the fossil record and opens a new dimension. To sum up:
\par 1) Darwin predicted that, once the fossil record was studied in detail, intermediate forms would be discovered to fill in the gaps between all the known species. This is what the theory expected. 
\par 2) But 150 years of work in paleontology has produced no intermediate forms, and no traces of these creatures have been discovered. This is a great defeat for the theory. 
\par 3) In addition to the fact that no intermediate forms have been found, the 
age of those creatures posited as ancestors of others only on the basis of comparison is also in dispute. A creature that appears more "primitive" may have appeared in the fossil record later than a creature that seems more "developed."
\par So, at this point, evolutionists were constrained to develop the inconsistent method known as cladistics. 
\par With cladistics, Darwinism, purporting to be a theory that starts from and relies on scientific evidence, has been revealed to be no such thing, but a dogma that distorts scientific evidence, changing it according to suppositions\emdash 
much like Lysenkoism, the official scientific doctrine of the USSR in the time of Stalin. It was nonsense concocted by Trofim Lysenko, who rejected the laws of genetics and was an adherent of La
marck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics. Like Lysenkoism, Darwinism, too, thus became recognized as having no basis in science.

Not only Prum and Brush's thesis, but every version of the "birds are dinosaurs" theory has been discredited. The differences in anatomical structure between birds and dinosaurs cannot be bridged by any process of evolution. Here I outline some of these d
ifferences, examined in detail in my other books: 
\par 1) The structure of birds' lungs is totally different from that of reptiles and all other land vertebrates. Air is unidirectional in birds, it always flows in one direction through the lung. So a bird is ab
le to constantly take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide at the same time. It is not possible that this structure, peculiar to birds, could have evolved from the lungs of an ordinary land vertebrate. Any creature possessing an intermediate structure could
 not breathe and therefore, would not survive.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 158}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365  
\par 2) Embryological comparisons of birds and reptiles made in 2002 by Alan Feduccia and Julie Nowicki showed a major difference in the hand structure of the two, proving that it was impossible to establish an evolutionary connection between them.}{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 159}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
\par 3) The final comparison between the skulls of the two groups showed the same conclusions. As a result of a study he carried out in 1999, Andre Elzanowski concluded that there were }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 "no specific avian similarities found in the jaws and palates of dromaeosaurids [a group of theropod dinosaurs]." }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 160}{\rtlch\fcs1 
\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 
\par 4) Another difference separating birds from reptiles is their teeth. It is known that in the past, some birds had teeth in their beaks\emdash which for a long time was presented as
 a so-called proof of evolution. But eventually, it became known that birds' teeth were peculiar to them. On this subject, Feduccia writes:

 their implantation. It is astounding that more attention has not been given to the dramatic differences between bird and theropod teeth, especially when one considers that the basis of mammal paleontology involves largely tooth morphology. To be brief, b
ird teeth (as seen in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 Archaeopteryx, Hesperornis, Parahesperornis, Ichthyornis, Cathayornis,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

tooth morphology between birds and theropods, including tooth form, implantation, or replacement. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 161}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

5) Birds are warm-blooded, while reptiles are cold-blooded. This means that they have two very different metabolisms and it's not possible that a change f
rom one to the other was effected by random mutations. To remove this difficulty, it was proposed that dinosaurs were warm-blooded. But this thesis rests on no evidence and there is much proof to discredit it.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par All this removes scientific support for the evolutionist thesis about the origin of birds. The Darwinist media may be able to prolong the furor over the dino-bird, but it is now clear that this was a non-scientific propaganda campaign. 
\par Everyone who examines the origin of birds and all the other c
reatures in nature apart from evolutionist dogma will plainly see that creatures are far too complex ever to be explained in terms of natural influences of random occurrences. The only explanation for this lies in the fact of Creation.

The Structure of Scientific Revolutions}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b0\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365 , deals with the concept of paradigm\emdash 
a scientific worldview accepted at any particular period of time. Sometimes scientists ally themselves 
closely with a paradigm, but over time as a result of new discoveries, it becomes clear that their paradigm was wrong. For example, at one time the commonly-held worldview was Claudius Ptolemy's model of an Earth-centered universe. It was a very strong pa
radigm, but was toppled by the discoveries of Copernicus, and a new paradigm was accepted in its place. According to Kuhn, the world of science often undergoes great paradigm shifts that are called "scientific revolutions."

le number of scientists make every effort to preserve the existing paradigm; in other words, they are conservative. For this reason, according to him, those who initiate scientific revolutions are not those with "scientific authority," but those still out
side the scientific world or young minds who have just entered that world. Kuhn quotes the known scientist Max Planck: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7359619\charrsid5071365

\par Today, the scientific world is experiencing a revolution. Darwinism has been scientifically discredited, but individuals regarded as "authorities" in the scientific community have not a
ccepted this. Their refusal to see the light is totally an ideological and dogmatic one. But it is getting weaker, and the public is aware of this. The name of the light beginning to glow before the eyes of the scientific world is }{\rtlch\fcs1

entists who have studied this subject assert that life is not the product of random natural forces as Darwin maintained, but on the contrary, is the work of a Creator with supreme knowledge. This Creator is God, the Lord of all the worlds. More and more s
cientists are accepting this fact every day, and the scientific collapse of Darwinism is being clearly demonstrated ever more clearly. 
\par One of the most important names in the anti-evolutionist movement, Phillip E. Johnson of the University of California at 
Berkeley, is certain that very soon, Darwinism will be thrown into the garbage can. After speaking about the new legal measures in various American states that allow scientific proofs against Darwinism to be included in textbooks, Johnson comments:

 the peppered moths or the fantastic horse series. They ignore the Cambrian Explosion, irreducible complexity and the origins of genetic information. But there is no longer any use for anyone influenced by outdated books and Darwinist propaganda to cling 
to this discredited theory. We invite Darwinists to avoid falling into such a situation, to discard their prejudice, accept the scientific evidence and see the truth.

 described this theory as a religion are such evolutionists as Julian Huxley and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin.

\par 88 Evolutionists resort to the Selfish DNA thesis to
 account for the alleged evolutionary emergence of non-coding DNA. This thesis is an illusory claim that there is a kind of competition among DNA components that have lost their function. As shown in this text, the thesis has been shattered by this study 
on crytomonads.

In the past, scientists have been caught up in various errors either because of the unsophisticated research equipment of their time or because of their own prejudices. Among such scientific errors, the greatest\emdash and most enduring\emdash 
historic example is one theory put forward concerning the origins of life. This theory's illogical claims have exerted a much greater influence than any of the other examples. This error, called Darwinism, unites a materialist worldview with a belief in e
volution.
\par The mask of Darwinism, which gained wide acceptance due to the inadequate level of scientific knowledge at the time, has finally been lifted in the 21st century, and it has emerged as an outdated and invalid theory. After seeing this clear truth, 
it is right to cease resisting it and to embrace it. Up to now, some may have believed in the lie of evolution because it was instilled in their minds by others. But if they are sincere, instead of running after a deception and being humiliated in this wo
rld and the next, they will seek to find the truth and live according to it. Those attached to Darwinism must give up believing blindly in this theory, study the conclusions of science, and evaluate them without prejudice.
\par If sincere in their search, even Darwinism's most avid supporters will see that this theory is a great deception, as proven by scientific facts. Sincerity and honesty, it must not be forgotten, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0
