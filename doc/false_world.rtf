A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash and therefore, Allah's existence\emdash 
over the last 140 years it 
has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think
 it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the r
e
ader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reje
ct spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The
 author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobser
vant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

ving completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Haru
n Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names Ha
run (Aaron) and Yahya (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and t
h
e Prophet Muhammad (saas), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to com
pletely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey
 the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many
 countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay
, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct s
tyle that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effec
t
iveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defea
ted, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other book
s that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effect in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emp
h
asize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qu
r'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the i
deological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a down
ward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

Throughout every moment of our lives, we encounter countless blessings and beauties created for us by Allah: the air we breathe, the varied and impressively lovely sights in nature, the splendid beauty in animals, plants and flowers are all examples of th
i
s incontestable fact. They, along with many other wonders of the natural world, all have a powerful impact upon the human soul. Yet there is one important fact about the beauties of this world which needs to be understood by man. As our Lord has revealed 
in His Book, "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 the life of this world is just the enjoyment of delusion}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 " (Surah Al 'Imran, 185).
\par The illusory and transitory nature of the life of this world stems from the fact that it is not permanent, that it will one day come to an end. As the Qur'an states, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
"He Who created death and life to test which of you is best in action" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
(Surat al-Mulk, 2), Allah has created the Earth and the blessings of the world in order to test man, to separate those who are committed to behaving in a godly manner from those wh
o embrace evil rather than good. Each of us will remain here for only a short time and can only enjoy these blessings for a limited period, according to Allah's will. It is the Hereafter in which people will live their true lives. This is how Allah has re
vealed in the Qur'an that the Hereafter represents one's true life:

One of the principal reasons that unbelievers imagine this world they live in to be real, forget about the Hereafter and seek only to fulfill their earthly desires is that, as revealed in the verses, they have "no intellect." They therefore imagine that t

eir whole lives are restricted to this world. Their narrow-minded perspectives on events and other judgments are nearly all directed towards this world. They see only the superficial aspects of the life of this world, are unable to comprehend its true pur
pose and spend their lives being totally forgetful of the Hereafter. Allah reveals the following about such people in the Qur'an:

'an that people learn the purpose behind their creation. They understand how they should serve Allah and they appreciate the truths about life itself. As set out in the preceding pages, we are informed in the Qur'an that }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 "the true life" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 is that of the Here
after. As revealed in the verses, therefore, the world we are living in at present is merely a "diversion," "a place of trial." When a person crosses over to the life of the Hereafter, all that will remain of this world will be brief memories in his or he
r mind. Compared to the Hereafter, the life of this world resembles "the blink of an eye," as in the following example:
\par Imagine that you are sitting happily by the banks of a river one lovely spring day. Imagine that a light breeze makes the air cool and re
freshing. Can you hear the delightful sound of the bubbling waters? Can you see the wonderful flowers, each more lovely than the last? Imagine that you are talking to a dear friend as you enjoy these beauties; imagine you are smelling the pure scent of th
e
 flowers on the air and listening to the sweet chirping of the birds. Imagine that as you are enjoying all these sensations you then wake up and find yourself lying in bed. In such a case, you would realize that everything you imagined to be real was in f
act nothing but a dream: a figment of your imagination, which suddenly evaporated.
\par Let us now imagine the same situation after you have woken up. Let us assume that you really are talking to a dear friend, enjoying all those sights and sounds by the banks of a sublime river.
\par If someone were to ask "which of the two would you prefer?" after you had experienced both, you would of course say, "the one after I had woken up." The reason is that what goes on in our dreams remains in our dreams and benefits a perso
n nothing in real life. Nobody can seriously feel sorrow at what he or she has lost in a dream since he or she knows that these have no effect on real life. No matter how much delight a person takes in a dream, this can never give as much pleasure as when
 he or she is awake and in the real world.
\par In the same way, the life of this world is dream-like, very short and transitory when compared to the Hereafter. Like returning from the world of the imagination to the real world on awakening from a dream, the lif
e of this world which seems so real now will shortly come to an end and your real, eternal life will begin in the Hereafter. This is how the Qur'an describes how people realize that they stayed only a short time in the life of this world:

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 Human beings always feel a deep longing for perfection in their souls. As a requirement of the testing they undergo, Allah, Who knows all their desires and passions, has created the lif
e of this world with flaws and imperfections alongside its countless blessings. People, if they wish to be spiritually successful, must strive to overcome these imperfections and rid themselves of flaws in order to pass the test erected in front of them b
y the Lord. However, one must always bear in mind the fact that it is still impossible for them to achieve the desired level of perfection. Allah has made this perfection unique to Paradise and to those of His servants deserving of bliss. 
\par In the life of this world, a struggle with a great many more imperfections is necessary just in order to survive; human beings, without exception, need to eat every day, sleep, protect themselves from illness, wash and take care of themselves. In exactly 
the same way, they need to use their reason and conscience at all times in order to protect themselves from the evils of earthly desires and to exhibit proper moral values. 
\par As revealed in the Qur'an, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 "He is Allah\emdash the Creator, the Maker, the Giver of Form. 
To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and Earth glorifies Him. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
 (Surat al-Hashr, 24), Allah's creation is flawless. Our Lord has the power to accomplish all and to create everything He so desires. Yet He encourages human beings to think by creating flaws and imperfections in the life of this world. 
\par When considered in its components and compared to the perfection of the life of Paradise, the wisdom in the imperfections in the life of this world c
an be more easily comprehended. To give an example, no matter what, an individual can go no longer than two or three days\emdash if that\emdash 
without sleeping. There then follows a gradual loss of consciousness and that person loses all touch with reality. Similarly, 
a person who goes several days without washing becomes dirty and will feel an immense physical discomfort. A person also needs to feed and look after him or herself on a regular basis in order to survive. Falling ill is another serious imperfection. That 
i
s because human beings are so helpless that even a germ or virus, so small as to be invisible to the naked eye, can result in sickness and oblige the individual to do nothing but rest for weeks on end. In such an event, the person becomes weak and takes l
ittle pleasure from most things. The individual concerned will no doubt become highly dependant on the help and care of other people. 
\par On account of His infinite compassion, our Lord has also created the means by which people can overcome the imperfections 
they encounter in the life of this world; foodstuffs which confer strength and power, materials which can be used for cleaning and bodily maintenance, and medicines capable of curing illness are all manifestations of Allah's compassion for and protection 
of His creatures. 
\par Alongside such physical imperfections in the life of this world, there are also spiritual ones: the way a person's heart may be troubled, and feeling of doubt or fear are examples of this. Moreover, earthly passions are never satisfied fo
r long; an activity embarked on with enormous enthusiasm soon becomes wearisome. These are all just some of the imperfections specially created by Allah in this world.
\par However, let us also note that although the spiritual difficulties in the life of this w
orld turn into great suffering for those without faith, believers live far distant from them. Human beings are created with a great many negative features in their desires; yet faith and a fear of Allah will shelter them from these evils and the weaknesse
s
 of their own passions, their own worldliness. Binding oneself to Allah with sincere faith and submission prevents a person from suffering such spiritual troubles as fatigue, despair and sorrow. On the other hand, the above-mentioned spiritual difficultie
s result in horrible crises for non-believers. 
\par With all these flaws and imperfections He has created,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid6847136  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
Allah reveals to us the false face of this world which He has created solely to test us in our faith. The individual thus longs for a life in which there is no imperfection, in which everything is flawless and complete\emdash 
for Paradise. In Paradise, people will live forever with no troubles of any kind, never becoming weary and never become bored of that which they are given by Allah. As He reveals in the Qur'an:

m the fact that they lead their lives far distant from Allah. Allah has created human beings in such a way that they can only find peace by remembering Him. Someone who fails to remember Allah wastes his or her life. Such people erroneously imagine that g
oods, property, rank or fame guarantee great happiness.
\par Only in the Hereafter will they realize the ultimate hollowness of the efforts they expended in this world. In return for their rejection of Allah in this world, they will encounter bitter suffering in
 the next. This is such a horrendous torment that they will happily give up all that was dear to them in this world to be freed from it: their families, their friends, the goods they were so deeply attached to and which they sought to add to by working da

no happiness in these attributes if he or she fails to live by the moral values of the Qur'an. On account of their denial, Allah fills the hearts of such people with unease, spiritual discomfort and restlessness. Although they live surrounded by blessings
 which appeal to their earthly desires they still take no real pleasure in them. No matter how happy and content they may appear, this is generally deceptive.
\par The unease experienced by unbelievers spreads into every area of their lives. Their failure to app
reciate the might of Allah, to think about destiny and look on events with a positive eye, and to exhibit proper moral values all guarantee trouble for them. Moreover, since they are unable to understand how the moral values of the Qur'an offer the indivi

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 We can see how all-encompassing and influential this trouble is. Some peoples' grea
test dream from childhood is to make a lot of money, become rich and spend that money howsoever they choose. This is so important to them that they will make any sacrifice to achieve that end. When their student years come to an end and they begin to find
 themselves undertaking serious responsibilities, they imagine that they are now in a position to deal with the difficulties life may confront them with.
\par Since they fail to consider that it is Allah Who gives human beings their daily bread and Who grants bl
essings and takes them away as He wishes, they wear themselves out in order to achieve such transitory benefits as wealth or position. They are essentially defeated by their own worldview. Much of the time, they are forced to give up things they love as t
h
ey strive for this end which they believe will bring happiness and contentment. They may eventually attain the enjoyment of this world at the end of this chase for glory, through so much difficulty and trouble. Yet the outcome is again no different. In ad
d
ition to all the trouble they experience in attaining their desires, they also begin to feel uneasy out of a fear of losing them. They have no idea how to be happy with what they have and make do with those blessings in their possession. They constantly c
omplain about the situation they are in and lament over the things they do not possess. Even the sight of someone wealthier, more cultured, more talented or apparently better looking than themselves is sufficient to undermine their morale.
\par They make great e
fforts not to allow their state of mind to show. They seek distraction and amusement and to free their souls from trouble in a variety of activities. They may indeed sometimes achieve happiness on a temporary and superficial level. At such times, they are
 
happy on the surface; yet this is not a permanent happiness. They feel massive doubt and fear yet they are so careful not to show this to the world. Indeed, even if they forget their woes for a time, they can at any moment fall victim once again to despai
r
, pessimism and sorrow because they do not submit themselves to Allah. When a jovial businessman suddenly remembers his debts; or a student regrets his poor marks; or the elderly look back on their lost youth; or the bereaved recall happy times they spent
 with their deceased friends\emdash these thoughts can give rise to sorrow and numbness. And it is similarly sobering for any of them when they realize that death, the inevitable end, is approaching.
\par Whether these people are rich or poor, old or young, attractive 
or ugly makes no difference. Someone obliged to labor under difficult conditions from morning to night is in exactly the same position as another person who enjoys total well-being and has no need to assume any responsibilities at all. They constantly exp
e
rience the difficulty of being unable to enjoy true interest, concern, love and affection from those around them. Since they imagine that the tasks they perform regularly every day and the responsibilities they bear will never come to an end, they feel a 
great weariness in their bodies, minds and hearts. They are indeed aware of how monotonous and meaningless their lives are and their inability to find a solution is a cause of major restlessness.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid6847136  }{

ition can never escape their doubts and troubles. They unequivocally fail to seek shelter in Allah. They do not abide by the road He has set out. They seek to adapt themselves to the lives they lead and regard troubles and difficulties as normal parts of 
life. 
\par In truth, Allah is punishing the unbelievers for their deeds with all these troubles they experience while they are still alive. Since they ignore the life of the Hereafter, their true life, and turn to the false things of this world, the sufferings

\par One of the most noticeable signs of false love\emdash love based on values other those of the Qur'an\emdash 
is the choice of friends. The fundamental logic behind the friendship of those who fail to consider the existence of the Hereafter is generally built
 upon ensuring the greatest mutual benefit in this world. Both sides have specific characteristics sought by the other and they look for a friend who can offer them material and emotional benefits of various sorts. The aim is to attain respect and prestig
e in the eyes of wider society. 
\par They attach considerable importance to the physical appearance, family situation, education and abilities of the person they select. Features of proper moral values such as love, respect and loyalty are generally of limited 
importance to the follower of godless love. In the absence of real love and respect in a friendship, there can of course be no true happiness. This also applies to the conception of marriage held by those who live far removed from the moral values of the 
Qur'an and, as with their friendships, relationships based on mutual advantage prevail.
\par However, the exact opposite applies to the believer. A person who believes in Allah loves and respects another to the extent of that individual's faith in and devotion t
o Him and proper moral values. That person hopes not for worldly interests or a temporary relationship with the other but for an eternal love compatible with the approval of Allah, Who has revealed that He will reward such people, together with their spou
ses, in the Hereafter:

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 The Qur'an states: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136

"Children of Adam! Do not let satan tempt you into trouble as He expelled your parents from the Garden, stripping them of their covering and disclosing to them their private parts. He and his tribe see you from where you do not
 see them. We have made the demons friends of those who do not believe."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
 (Surat al-A'raf, 27) Satan brings those he makes friends with under his control and directs them in the ways of his own loathsome moral values. 
\par People who win the friendship of satan
 instead of the approval of Allah are deprived of a great many blessings. One of these losses is the way that such people never have true friends. Friendship is a blessing given by our Lord to those who take Him as their friend. As revealed in the verse, 
}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 "Your friend is only Allah and His Messenger and those who believe: those who perform prayer and give the alms, and bow."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136  (Surat al-Ma'ida, 55), Allah grants these people the friendship of devout believers.
\par Satan's friendship, on the other hand, leaves a pe
rson permanently alone. That is because satan tells those he adopts as friends that lies, deviance, rebellion, denial and hatred are pleasant things. People under the influence of satan approach those around them with just that moral understanding. They w
ill primarily act according to their own interests and agenda. Such a person's best friend is him}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid6847136  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
or herself. It is therefore impossible for such people to build true and permanent friendships as alluded to in the Qur'an.
\par In a society which does not live by
 the moral values of the Qur'an, it is very hard to find a reliable and sincere friend from whom to seek help, to whom to entrust property or valuables or money or to confide in. Furthermore, this situation has become so widely accepted that many regard i
t as an immutable fact of life.
\par It is impossible for people to be at ease in such an insecure environment. That is because even when a friend seems to have been found, there always exists the danger that these "friends" may in fact be acting out of self-int
erest. This scenario is therefore far removed from true friendship. Some people look upon one another with envy in relation to jobs, cars or homes which they may covet. They may wish to achieve superiority over the other. They therefore take advantage of 
even the slightest opportunity to locate each others' weaknesses and rise above one another.
\par People who behave with such an understanding are aware that they are living in a most untrustworthy and insincere environment. They are perfectly aware that they ha
ve no friends in the true sense of the word. Yet since they fail to seek a solution by living by the moral values of the Qur'an, they are unable to escape their predicament. Neither will these people who fail to turn to the true path have any friends in t
h
e Hereafter. They will find the same uneasy, insincere, insecure environment they experienced in the world but multiplied many times over in the Hereafter. The position in the Hereafter of those who take satan as their friend in this world is revealed by 
our Lord:

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 Allah has revealed in the Qur'an that superiority among people rests solely upon godliness (Su
rat al-Hujurat, 13). In societies in which such elements as faith, fear of Allah and proper morality are ignored, the criteria by which superiority is measured are rather different. These people imagine that superiority lies with the most prominent member
s
 of society and can be acquired with the acquisition of goods and property, recognition or fame. Since this perspective is generally shared by most members of such a society, those without goods and property are generally thought of as "inferior" to those
 who are wealthy and enjoy wide circles of acquaintance. 
\par The manner in which people treat those around them in such societies, the decisions they take, the way they evaluate events, and the conclusions they draw from them are all directly related to the pe
rspective they hold. For that reason, it is impossible to speak of a true idea of justice among people who act in the light of that conception.
\par Such a thing is out of the question for those who have faith. Believers always act by taking the moral values re
vealed by Allah in the Qur'an as their yardstick. They therefore always attach the greatest weight to justice and truth. They do not judge people according to worldly values but according to whether they have the requisite fear of Allah and to their moral
 
values. They favor not the powerful and those with material means but always what is right and those in the right. They make no concessions on justice, even if this works against them and those closest to them. They decide not according to earthly values

\par They are also very honest in their business dealings. Due to their fear of Allah they behave in the manner ordained in the verse, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 "Give full measure when you measure and weig
h with a level balance. That is better and gives the best result"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136  (Surat al-Isra', 35). 
\par They are also fastidious about maintaining the bounds set by Allah and are fearful of transgressing Allah's laws. Among people who have no fear of Allah and belief in 
the Hereafter, one can encounter mutual deception in business life and partnerships and attitudes aimed at unfair profits. It is revealed in the Qur'an how Prophet Dawud (as) addressed the litigants who came to him in these terms: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 
\ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 "Truly many partners are unjust to one another\emdash except those who believe and do right actions, and how few they are!"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
 (Surah Sad, 24). Here, the Qur'an is drawing attention to this environment of insecurity and injustice which prevails among unbelievers. 
\par The proper behavior of those who believe can be seen in whatever environment they may be found. Their modesty, forgiveness and tolerance, and the way they respond to wickedness with goodness are all features of the superior moral virtues of believers. All
ah reveals that believers respond to wickedness inflicted on them with patience and goodness thus in the Qu'ran:

\par One of the main reasons for believ
ers having such pleasing moral values is their fear of Allah. At the same time, because they value the life of this world only as much as Allah has ordained, they never become caught up in passions and desires or exhibit extreme behavior. They make every

ffort to live by the moral values which Allah has revealed, those of which He approves of. They never forget that the blessings created by Allah on Earth are merely to test people and are simply the enjoyment of the life of this world. Thanks to this unde

hasing after the life of this world and spending one's valuable life in doing so?"

 living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "as
sumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions.

 ask: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangeme

 bringing organic chemicals together.

on, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can 
replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replicatio
n. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136

Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threa
t of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another
 living species, for instance, horses.

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologis
t Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new spec
ies to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 
, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.8
\par However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the tw
entieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

nced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replicatio
n errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous
 complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on t
he contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

ature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a
 highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai0\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i0\f0\cf1\up4\insrsid7079266\charrsid6847136 9}{

o simple as to be understood even by children:
\par The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including
 man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a 
single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materi
als present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessa
ry. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids\emdash which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions\emdash and as many proteins\emdash a single one of which has a formation probability of 10}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of yea
r
s. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope
.
 They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or m
illions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take 
other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. 
\par The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on t
he eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. Wit
h this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may e
ven be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For i
nstance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen 
p
roduced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness
.
 Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distin
ction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision 
quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground ap
pears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and dist
inct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? H
ow can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The sam
e situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by tra
nslating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does n
ot let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the 
noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to gene
rate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been work
i
ng on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when so
u
nd is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a s
ound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

\par The stimulations coming from a person's eyes, ears, and nose travel to the brain as electro-chemical nerve impulses. In biology, physiology,
 and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact: Who perceives these electro-chemical nerve impulses as images, sounds, odors, and sensory events in th
e
 brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for an eye, an ear, and a nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? Of course it does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer, and neurons comprising the br
ain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions. 
\par For this consciousness is the spirit created by Allah, which needs neither the eye to watch the images nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, it does not need the brain to think. 
\par Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty Allah, and fear and seek refuge in Him, for He squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeter
s in a three-dimensional, colored, shadowy, and luminous form.

s inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside 
as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only mat
erialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious
 matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning f
lashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a mater
ialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fas
hioned all living beings.

There is one important fact about the beauties of this world which needs to be understood by man. As our Lord has revealed, \'93The life of this world is just the enjoyment of delusion\'94 (Surah Al \lquote Imran, 185).
\par It is therefore a major error for any person to become disproportionately infatuated with the world\rquote s transitory blessings during his brief existence in this life. In the Qur\rquote 
an, Allah reveals that the benefits of this world are ultimately worthless, and promises that He will give \'93a good life\'94 to those who seek the Hereafter. On the other hand, there is a \'93dark and narrow life\'94
 for those who are unaware of these truths.
\par Believers are aware of these truths revealed in the Qur\rquote 
an. They know that all they experience is part of a test set for them by Allah. They feel no great passion for the blessings of this world. They instead spend their whole lives in such a way as to attain the Hereafter promised to them.
\par In this book, by using examples which may be encountered at any time and any place, the unnecessary sufferings and woes of those who are deceived by the false baubles of this world are considered. Ways in which these can be a
voided, and the trouble-free lives of believers who spend all their energies on attaining the Hereafter are explored. Recalling Allah\rquote s revelation in the Qur\rquote an, \'93
Anything you have been given is only the enjoyment of the life of this world and its finery. What is with Allah is better and longer lasting. So will you not use your intellect?\'94
 (Surat al-Qasas, 60), people are invited to lead lives better suited to the approval of Allah.
