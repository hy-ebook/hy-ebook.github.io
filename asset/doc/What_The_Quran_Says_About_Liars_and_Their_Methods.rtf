nti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style en

\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their re\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
flections and experiences to one another. 
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this re

\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subject

Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deologies as fascism and communism.

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpos
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godles
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ide
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 logies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eans in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
adily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
or the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This book warns people against lying, which they regard as innocent or harmless, even th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A significant number of people are habitual liars, having acquired this habit from others while \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they were still children or teenagers. For example, many young people lie about where they have been. Alternatively, when people are asked why they somehow did not live up to the other person's expectations, they might lie, sometimes without even thinking
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0  in order to escape the blame. If they were to think a little, they would see that being honest with others would not put them at any disadvantage vis-\'e0\loch\f0 -vis others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 People also frequently lie when asked for their opinions. Instead of expressing their real \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ideas, they prefer to say what the other person wants to hear or to give an answer that will suit their personal interests. They do so either out of fear or the desire to win that person's approval.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Giving an answer that suits their own interests is widesp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
read among people who are far from religion. They convince themselves that it is only natural to look after their own interests by adopting a defensive mentality. In such a society, this idea is regarded as extremely natural. Indeed, when a believer who l
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ves by the Qur'an's values insists upon observing justice even at the expense of his own interests, unbelievers consider him to be either naive or unsophisticated rather than an exemplar of superior morality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
People may classify lies as harmless when they are told to protect their own interests. For instance, when a friend asks for a loan, many people who could provide the loan find ways to avoid doing so by claiming that they are looking for a loan themselves
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
or that business is going badly. This tactic is used to block the other person's request from the outset. Among people who are far from the Qur'an's morality, such behavior is not considered immoral.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it is possible to encounter people who lie \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
out of habit, even if they have no definite aim in mind. Such lies are based mostly on a person's having nothing to talk about or a desire to attract attention. For example, when nobody is paying any attention to them, such people may say that they did no
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 sleep at all, even though they had a perfectly good night's sleep. Or, they might say that they have not eaten all day, instead of only a few hours, or that they have a terrible headache about which they can do nothing, even though the headache is only m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nor. Even though these lies might be seen as "minor" and "harmless," Allah has told us that all lies, without exception, displease Him.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One reason for lying is to annoy the person addressed or to show him that he is not\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Lying in order to mock others is also a widespread form of immorality. For instance, a person who wants to mock one of his friends might convince him\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that a fictitious event really took place. Believing his lying friend's words, he passes on the "news" to others and, when the truth comes out, is regarded as credulous or stupid. This entertains people who enjoy lying and mocking others. By mocking thei

 friends' credulity and belief in them, such liars consider themselves to be very cunning and intelligent. In reality, however, Allah does not approve of this and the mocker eventually is exposed as a manipulative person who is disliked. He has, therefore

 (Surat al-Kahf, 18:54). When a few people come together, usually they compete in making claims about a particular subject, put fo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rward different ideas, and try to make each other accept these ideas. In these arguments, the aim is usually not to learn the truth and reach the best conclusion, but rather to win the argument by convincing others of one's own ideas and ignoring anything
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that is wrong with them. Even if one of the parties realizes that he is wrong and is thinking incorrectly, he usually will continue arguing out of arrogance, even though his claims bear no relation to the truth. At this point, most people resort to lying.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

All of these methods are due to the person's arrogance and concern that people might not see them as they wish to be seen. As stated above, arrogance usually drives people into sin, whereas the best and most noble thing for a person to do is to ad

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Perhaps you have heard people reply, when asked if they ever lie, that they certainly do not lie, but that they see nothing wrong with telling "white lies" when necessary.

pinion and those of the people around them, and in such a way that their own interests are met in all matters. For example, they admit that theft is sinful but say that it is not sinful if the thief steals out of necessity. Some people who know that gambl

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ing. Those who try to call lying by another name to soften its meaning may convince other people, but Allah has forbidden people to lie, and that includes white lies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Qur'an does not accept any of the above rationales for white lies. In addition, those\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 who tell them shape them according to their own opinions about what does and does not constitute a white lie. Of course, their definitions are designed to suit their own advantage. One result of this is that society begins to accept lying as normal, beca
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 se it gradually begins to count all lies as white lies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, a merchant who tries to sell something to a female customer plies her with false courtesy, tells her that she is beautiful when she is not, that she is well dressed when she is not, and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that she is talented and intelligent when she really has no talent or intelligence at all. A man who comes home late uses a variety of excuses to avoid annoying his wife. He says that telling his wife the truth would only make her angry, but that when he 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ells these white lies, he does not make her uncomfortable and creates no trouble between them. People who tell such lies have no love, respect, or devotion for the person to whom they are told. Furthermore, it is obvious that such people are not honest or
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 trustworthy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In conclusion, all lying, no matter what it may be called, has been forbidden by Allah, for it destroys trust and loyalty between people and causes people to live insincere lives.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n, swearing oaths and claiming to be well-intentioned would later come to be among all liars' most defining characteristics.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Satan also deceives a wrongdoer with empty promises\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 because they fear that their lies will be exposed, they do not act comfortably and naturally. Their speech, voice, and posture are carefully controlled. Due to their state of continual tension, their voices are weak and their eyes are narrow. They regard

Just like Pharaoh, sly people try to present themselves to others as different from what they really are: people who are devoted to wickedness and treachery. Slyness colors even their everyday behavior. For example, they have secretive meth

ods of making others angry. Under a mask of benevolence and innocence, they take pains to avoid giving themselves away. However, others detect their immorality right away, because their superficial cleverness contains no real wisdom. And so they lose othe

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For instance, seeking to reduce their own workloads, they sometimes take some of their paperwork and leave it on their coworkers' desks. They make it seem as if this job was specially given to them\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 or they were doing some kind of favor by transferring an important job to them, when, in fact, their only intention is to get rid of the work that they do not want to do. If their coworkers object, these insincere people try to forestall any protest by s

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
." But when they begin to see that their coworkers are becoming tired and are facing great difficulties, while they themselves have nothing to do, they only "listen to their conscience" when the job is nearly finished so that the boss or other people will

not ask why they did not help out. Or, they might be looking for a way to prevent a possible complaint from their coworkers by going to the boss and saying: "My colleague has too much work to do by himself. I don't want things to get delayed, so please le

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this que\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
stion from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their neck
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "}{\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. }{\b\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 
\par }{\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, woul

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism."

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot for

s of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron m

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hen take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and lo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
k around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 -\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
urpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 al perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thout putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a res\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ult of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
iddle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Ne
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
vertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that mome
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
delity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest}{\f0\insrsid12540821\charrsid1315154 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{

company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music star\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing ar\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0
