at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the impostur
e of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par His penname is a composite of the names }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 Harun}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663  (Aaron) and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (
s
aas), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the o
bjections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message
, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from Indi

Indonesian. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to u
nderstand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite re
s
ults, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the bo
oks written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that crea
te confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the
 
author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's mor
al values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological
 prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spira
l of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.}{\rtlch\fcs1

al philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash and therefore, Allah's Existence\emdash 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show
 everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par 
\par All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'an
ic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that 
e
veryone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and ca
nnot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to com
municate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par 
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopel
ess, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

\ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\expnd6\expndtw30\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 T}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 here must be something in your life that you have spent a lot of time and energy to get. Think of when you
 were in school, a time of frequent exams taken to prepare yourself for entrance into the university of your choice. Most young people regard such exams as turning points in their lives, because these exams will determine the shape of their future. They p
repare for years for this event, give up their sleep and special activities, vacations, and other entertainment. Totally focused on entering their chosen university, they remain patient and determined to achieve this goal.
\par Now, consider the situation of tho
se people whose most important aim is to own a nice house. In order to afford their dream home, they must first have the financial ability to buy it. Therefore, they will work day and night to get a good job and then move on to higher positions and larger
 salaries. After years of self-sacrifice, they will be able to buy or build their dream house.
\par As these examples show, people often have to work with great determination for years in order to overcome all of the obstacles standing between them and the objec
t or goal to which they attach such value. Furthermore, if people pursue financial power, social respect, reputation, or a particular career, they will have to exert serious effort in the face of various setbacks and, as they say, "give something of thems
elves."
\par But here we must consider an important point: The above examples are about the transitory pleasures of this worldly life, all of which will disappear with the person\rquote 
s death or may be lost suddenly due to some unexpected mishap. For example, a young person who spends years working assiduously to pass an exam may be killed in an accident before taking that exam. Or, a person\rquote 
s effort and energy expended in the quest of buying a house may be disastrously undone in an instant through fire.
\par All of the pl
easures sought after in this earthly life, no matter how hard we may work for them, are transitory. But there is also a real and genuine life of endless pleasure, one that will never be lost or consumed, one that human beings will enjoy for eternity: the 
life after death that believers work so hard in this life to attain. They regard this goal as being far more important than anything else and always keep it before their eyes.
\par So, this worldly life is a "testing ground" that human beings must go through to 
determine which type of eternal life they will experience in the Hereafter. While in this world, human beings take an exam to enter the Afterlife. In every case, the correct answer is to pursue Allah's good pleasure. In reality, life is no more than a tra
n
sitory testing and training period created by Allah for each person. Throughout this period, human beings are responsible for pondering this reality in order to know our Lord, obey His commands, and seek His good pleasure. They are also responsible for sh
o
wing grace, patience, and moral strength in the face of everything that happens to them while in this world. The great secret within this test is known only to believers: to be content in knowing that everything is a test from our Lord and to meet every e
ventuality with joyful enthusiasm.
\par Those who grasp this secret and live according to this hidden, but nevertheless clear, truth will gain an eternal and never-ending treasure. This book announces these truths to those who do not know this secret and so live
 their lives without ever thinking about reality, and reminds them that they should set for themselves a much greater goal than the things of this world.

\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 " (Surat adh-Dhariyat, 56). In other words, all people were created to serve Allah.
\par Human beings have a lifespan of roughly 60 to 70 years. But like an hourglass, time is constantly running out. Everyone will stay in this world for a length of time that is known only to Allah,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid198663  }{

\par People
 are tested according to how they respond to what they encounter in the world, as well as how they exercise their moral characters and intentions. It is definitely not enough for them to say "I believe"; rather, they must show their faith through their ac
tions and words. On the Day of Judgment, everything they have done, both public and private, will be revealed and they will have to give a detailed account. While doing so, they will not suffer any injustice, for the Qur'an says "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0

It is very important to ponder these wise words. As we said earlier, people are responsible for serving Allah and for submitting and remaining attached to Him in all circumstances. One way to show this attachment is to be patient in all difficulties and f

\par For this reason, people must make the best use of every moment of time allotted to them in this world. Befor

 But one of the main things that prove the strength of the Muslims' faith is their refusal to compromise their moral character. Muslims who patiently endure poverty, hunger, fear, personal and material loss, illness, threats from unbelievers, slander, and
 entrapment will receive a better reward for their moral excellence.

The trust and submission described in these verses is a good example for all Muslims. But unbelievers cannot understand this patient trust, for they think that believers are just like themselves and behave according to their own misguided criteria. T

\par But this is a grave error on their part, for Muslims who unde

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 No person can know the future, because all people 
are bound by time and can assess events only from the standpoint of the moment in which they are currently living. As they cannot know the future, they may not always be aware of the long-term significance or usefulness of what they are facing. But Allah,
 
Who created time, is and therefore sees all from "outside time." Here we come to the reality of destiny, defined as Allah's knowledge of all past and future events, as well as their results, in one moment. (For a detailed discussion of this topic, see Har
un Yahya's }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 Timelessness and the Reality of Fate }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 [New Delhi: Goodword Publisher, 2001].) 
\par Thus, Allah knows the beginning and the end of all human trials, the past and the future, as well as the present moment. In His sight, everything has already been accom
plished. However, we learn about these events only when we experience them at the appropriate time. 
\par Unbelievers cannot understand this "knowledge of destiny," and thus cannot be aware of it. It is this knowledge that allows Muslims to show patience in all of their difficulties and trials. As the Qur'an says: "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\b\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 No misfortune occurs except by Allah's permission. Whoever believes in Allah\emdash He will guide his heart. Allah has knowledge of all things}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
" (Surat at-Taghabun, 11), believers live in the comfort of knowing that whatever happens to them is the result of destiny.
\par As a mercy from Him, Allah has created various trials for believers and then made them easy to endure, provided that they remain fai
thful to Him and put themselves in His hands. Those Muslims who truly believe and sincerely submit to Him see a lesson in the constant change that appears to them, and they contemplate it eagerly and with thankfulness. Similar to someone who sits comforta
b
ly in a theater watching a movie, they follow with joyful trust the destiny prepared for them. Sometimes these scenes are full of activity or frightening; other times they may be pleasant and serene. But in their totality, however, there is the joy and ea
gerness of belief. Frightening scenes have been especially prepared and planned down to their slightest detail. But in the end, all of them are included in Allah's knowledge and under His control. 
\par Those Muslims who understand the reality of destiny and gra
sp the secret of its trials see each instance of misfortune, hunger, or poverty as a good thing and take great pleasure in it, knowing that the fine moral character they display in the face of these trials is very precious in Allah's sight. This type of j
oy is unique to believers. When confronted by such difficulties, Muslims do not give way to melancholy, stress, pain, panic, or fear, because they know that Allah will change all of these things to their advantage. In the Qur'an, Allah says to believers:

 of this short period of testing, they will receive the reward of endless life in Paradise.
\par Muslims who are aware of this reality become more eager when faced with difficulties. At the same time, this eagerness foils the unbelievers' traps and defeats all o
f their efforts. When unbelievers think that they have put believers in a difficult situation, but then see the believers' sincere joy and gladness, they understand that they can never hurt them. Moreover, the believers' words in times of difficulty demon
strate their submission and trust in Allah. The Qur'an reveals some of these words:

 that something good will come after the difficulty ends, either in this world or the next. This is what it means to view events from the standpoint of the future. 
\par Muslims know that they are observers of their own destiny and that of others. Knowing this,
 they observe everything with patience, trust, and submission. In addition, they know that they cannot interfere with, prevent, or stop how an event will unfold. They keep the following words firmly in mind: "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0

The quality of a Muslim's belief and moral character is revealed in difficult times. Under such circumstances, we see their superior morality, courage, patience, trust, perception, fortitude, tolerance, willingness to forgive, self-sacrifice, mercy, human
ity, appreciation, conscience, and composure. 
\par "The Muslim of difficult times" indicates an individual who endures every difficulty, frustration, and deprivation while displaying the qualities listed above. Such people never compromise their moral character
, encounter every eventuality with great maturity and trust in Allah, see the reason for everything that happens and the good in it, and exhort others to practice the same superior morality. As The Qur'an says: "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 (Surat al-Ahzab, 10), these difficult times are when believers undergo serious testing and are beset by frustrations.
\par When we speak of difficult times, some examples come to the mind of peopl
e who do not know Allah: a natural disaster, losing a job, bankruptcy, and similar events. But for those with faith, the difficult moments refer to more serious situations: a time when a person is deprived of his or her most basic requirements, and when t
h
e frustrations are far more serious than those experienced in daily life. The Qur'an defines such times when "the heart roses to the throat" as periods when every imaginable kind of difficulty, illness, and disaster falls upon a person one after another, 
such as when they are thrown out of their house, driven from their country, confronted with traps set just for them, as well as their family and people, and they are subject to spiritual oppression.
\par The Qur'an provides examples of the difficulties experienced by the Prophets and devout believers. As we said earlier, devout believers have been brought through and endured many serious trials, for:

When people come face to face with difficulty or frustration, they hear two inner voices. One is the conscience, which urges them to behave as Allah wants them to behave: with self-sacrifice, courage, and moral rectitude.
 Those who listen to this voice will choose to be patient and trust in Allah. The second voice belongs to the lower self, described as that which "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 commands to evil acts}{

ardice, causes those who listen to it great loss and attracts Satan's "friendship." To describe to people what they will lose by making this bargain, it is necessary to know how Satan acquired his influence over them. The Qur'an gives detailed information
 about this and also warns people against his entrapments.
\par When Allah created Prophet Adam (as), He commanded the angels and Satan to bow before him. The angels did so, but in his arrogant pride, Satan refused to do so and was therefore driven out of Paradi
se for this rebellion. He then asked Allah to allow him to influence people until the Day of Judgment. Allah granted this request, but said that he would have no influence over His believing servants. Satan vowed that he would deceive human beings with va
rious promises, deceptions, and entrapments, and draw them away from the true path. The Qur'an relates his oath, as follows:

faithful and strong in such times. But when the trial comes, their behavior does not match their earlier promises and they react negatively when touched by the least frustration. They become angry all of a sudden and, instead of love and compassion, displ
a
y angry recrimination. In a moment, they can become suspicious, rebellious, and demanding. In such instances, the strong will be separated from the weak and corrupted morality will show itself; those whose belief is weak will reveal themselves by becoming
 immersed in anxiety. These people are just one step away from joining the unbelievers and their anti-Muslim activities. Occasions such as these increase by several times the value of a Muslim whose belief is sincere and strong.
\par All of the difficulties and frustrations encountered in daily life are both a test and a means to a happiness that can be compared to the Paradise that Muslims hope to attain in the afterlife. It is a source of great pleasure to compare the difficulties w
i
th this ease and comfort. And, for sincere Muslims, each of such difficulties brings an increase of love, respect, and appreciation from other Muslims, and is a blessing that deepens their belief. It is a divine blessing with abundant benefits and beautie
s that makes believers take that person as an example. In addition, it has a positive influence on the belief of those around them (by Allah's grace) and makes them worthy of the unbelievers' admiration, whether secret or open.
\par Someone who thinks that a par
ticular event is outside the plan of destiny is under Satan's strong influence, which often is the cause of such doubts. Satan takes great pleasure in seeing people fall into this situation. Sometimes, under his influence, people may fall into the sicknes
s of considering an apparently insignificant matter as being outside the sphere of destiny or beyond Allah's mercy, knowledge, and intention. Believers must be aware of and avoid this sickness, and be able to cure it if they somehow succumb to it.
\par For examp
le, there is good in every event in such apparently minor things as missing a certain television program or forgetting to order something to eat. For example, missing a television program might give them some extra time to do a good deed, think good thoug
h
ts, or might arrive at an idea that will increase their ability to serve Allah even more. Or, in that period of time they may remember Allah and understand far more than they would have gotten from the television program. Forgetting to order something to 
e
at may be like a diet that cures an illness. People with high blood-pressure may find that it returns to normal if they forget to eat cheese one day. By putting themselves in Allah's hands, they gain merit in His sight and win His approval by striving to 
do good deeds. Besides, always trusting in Allah is a means for believers to attain love and contentment. 
\par Given that many similar examples can be gleaned from daily life, it is very important to understand this matter and not let it slip our mind. Whatever
 people encounter, important or insignificant, is included in destiny. Satan suggests that these events are a necessary component of daily life and have nothing to do with destiny. However, believers must always be alert and aware of these suggestions, fo
r
 being able to understand this and keep it in our remembrance, see reason and good in every thing and event, and realize that everything happens within Allah's good plan is a great blessing in this world and the world to come. This is a truth that gives w
isdom, will, comfort, and contentment to all believers.

\par There is very good reason why good and evil are so closely connected with each other. One reason is that the value of good and evil may be understood only within this contradiction. If evil, deprivation, or disaster did 
not exist, people could not understand the value of good. For example, when you place a diamond among ordinary stones, its beauty and allure becomes more evident. 
\par Another reason is found in the secret of this transitory world's trials. Here, people are te
sted with good and evil. In the testing, the difference in degree between the two will become evident, and the good will be separated to one side, and the evil to the other. While the Angel of Death will take the souls of evil people with great harshness,
 good people will be invited to enter the beauty and pleasure of Paradise. The Qur'an says that these trials are the way by which believers are distinguished from those with a disease in their hearts:

\par Bediuzzaman discusses in depth how difficulties and disasters separate the good from the evil, and gives very good and wise advice on this matter. When asked what the purpose of 
Satan and wickedness is, he concludes that some very important reasons lie behind every frustration, deprivation, and wickedness. The most important of these is the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
separation between a "coal-like" disposition and a "diamond-like" disposition. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 He uses thi
s example to show that every kind of difficulty and frustration brings out the best in a person. The trials of this world bring to light each person's bad aspects and so provide the opportunity to correct them. For example, a serious illness may reveal an
 
individual's timidity or spiritual weakness. Thus, when a woman becomes aware of her weakness, she immediately remedies it. So, the illness allowed her to see her mistakes and to correct them within this short lifetime. After this misfortune, one more imp
u
rity will be done away with, and her moral character will be improved. Take the example of a man with a life-long reputation for being honorable but then goes bankrupt and resorts to illegal means to get money. This shows how misfortune can reveal a perso
n's bad aspects. But if this individual does not commit a sin and compromise his honor despite his need for money, then his deprivation will show that he is really pure and devout.
\par In his Letters, Beddiuzzaman gives examples of the wisdom of showing patience in situations that will later turn out for the good. He writes: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
So, the creation in the universe of wickedness, hurt, trials, evil and suffering is not something bad or ugly; these things have been created for a very important purpose. \'85in the world of h
uman beings advance and decline are endless. There is a great distance between the Nimrods and Pharaohs on one hand and the saints and prophets on the other. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
So to distinguish between the coal-like base spirits and diamond-like spirits above, the creation 
of Satan opened an arena of struggle, contest, and trial to which prophets are sent and in which the secret of responsibility is revealed. If there were no struggle and contest, the qualities within coal and diamonds would remain indistinguishable in the 
human ore. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
The exalted spirit of Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and the base spirit of Abu Jahl would remain on the same level. This means that the creation of evil and wickedness is not bad and ugly because it leads to important results.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\up4\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 7
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 Anoth
er matter stressed here is the value of this world's trials. If there were no evil or frustration, the good qualities in human character would not come to the fore, the high moral quality of devout persons would not be displayed, and there would be no adv
a
nce in one's level of spirituality. This is why every eventuality that appears to be negative in fact opens an unlimited horizon of opportunity to mature one's moral character, strengthen and deepen one's spirituality, and raise one's rank and position in
 Paradise.

es must be separated from the base coal-like qualities. But as this can be done only by applying fire, human beings must go through a serious testing period involving difficulties, misfortunes, and various frustrations to remove their bad qualities so tha
t their good qualities can shine in the light of day.
\par Bediuzzaman gives another example: the separation of silver and copper from the ore when it is struck against a touchstone. Two valuable materials are separated from each other by striking the ore agains
t that stone, and the valueless copper ore is eliminated. In this process of separation, the ore has to be struck violently against the stone and then passed through a fine sieve. This process reveals the silver within the ore and cleanses it of the coppe
r
 ore, which reduces its value. What the master means by being "struck against the stone" is that undergoing difficulties, misfortunes, and various frustrations will cause the person's internal beauty to be revealed. The severity of the difficulties and fr
u
strations reveal the strength of the person's belief, as well as the superiority of his or her moral character, discernment, faithfulness, and loyalty. Moreover, this testing leaves behind a maturity of character with great faith and spiritual depth. So, 
this process purges the believer's superior character of all qualities that weaken it, until it appears like silver. Bediuzzaman writes: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663

"If you feel pain, they too are feeling it just as you are. But you hope for something from Allah, for which they cannot hope"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663  (Surat an-Nisa', 
104). As this verse says, both believers and unbelievers are struck by the same kinds of difficulties and frustrations. But because unbelievers have no faith in Allah and do not consider that every event has been created by Him, they do not expect to rece
ive from Allah what believers hope to receive. So, the basic difference is that they remain oblivious of life's true meaning. In other words, the believers' belief in Allah totally separates them from the unbelievers in the afterlife.
\par For example, Allah tel
ls us that people will be tried by hunger and poverty. While hunger is a major difficulty and frustration for unbelievers, for Muslims it is a trial in which they can show the quality of their moral character and a good opportunity that they should not mi
ss. In such times, submission to Allah, trust, and patience gain great importance, and the fact that they do not lose hope but rather see the good in what is happening are indications that they are passing the test.
\par Unbelievers consider their own advantage 
and comfort first; however, the believers' moral quality always gives precedence to the other person. Believers freely give to other believers the best seat, the best food, and the best clothing. When it is cold, sincere Muslims will always take care of t
h
eir fellow Muslims by offering them blankets and hot drinks, even when they themselves are cold. They take joy in ensuring their friend's health, safety, comfort, and happiness, for they know that the pleasure derived from these acts of self-sacrifice can
not be compared with the pleasure of drinking the hot drink themselves.
\par People can exhibit fine moral qualities if everything is going well amid an abundance of blessings, if their health is good and their needs are being met. But showing exemplary moral qu
ality in times of difficulty, or displaying good treatment toward others while being shunned, slandered, or vilified by harsh words, is to respond to evil with good. Another sign of good moral character is when a person who is not hungry gives food to ano
t
her and a person who is warm gives clothing to someone who is cold. Both people are very valuable in Allah's sight, but showing moral excellence in the face of difficulty and bad treatment is very important and valuable, for it displays the strength and s
incerity of an individual's faith, devoutness, and superior virtue.
\par In addition, those who live a virtuous life listening to their conscience may hear their lower self constantly urging them toward evil, suggesting that they will find it hard to be virtuous
, and trying everything to prevent them from being so. This voice makes people fear that they will be cold if they give away a sweater or that they will be hungry if they give away their food. This is one of Satan's tactics, for he uses the fear of povert
y in an attempt to prevent believers from helping the poor:

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 One of the most notable th
ings that distinguish devout Muslims from others is their attention to Allah's commands and recommendations. No difficulty, frustration, or restriction will lessen their resolve to obey them or lead them to compromise their moral character. No matter how 
much in need or trouble they may be, they will never consider doing anything forbidden by Allah. In a situation rife with illness, need, failure, or oppression, they will not compromise their honesty and sincerity. 
\par As we said earlier, Satan wants to divert
 human beings from the true path and get them to listen to the negative voice of their lower self. So, he urges them to do things that Allah has forbidden and blocks them from doing what Allah has approved. This inner negative voice always works toward th
i
s goal, continually suggesting wicked things to their minds. For example, this negative voice wants to prevent people from getting up to perform their prayers; it makes them sleepy, listless, and out of sorts; and it constantly tries to make them forget w
hy they should do this. Satan inspires them to ask themselves: "What's the difference if I don't get up just for today?" 
\par But believers do not listen to this negative voice. They get up every morning with eager determination to perform their prayers, rememb
ering that this is the way to true beauty and salvation. This negative voice finds every excuse to make fasting appear difficult, even though Allah has commanded that this kind of worship be performed. It tries to make it appear that hunger and thirst are
 
difficult to endure. If they fast, this voice makes them doubt their ability to do it. But devout Muslims fast with eager determination despite their lower self's insistent pressure. They hope for reward from our Lord for the hunger, thirst, and fatigue t
hat they have endured to gain His favor. And in this, they take great pleasure.
\par Similarly, in some situations where making money illegally is considered legitimate, this inner voice makes it appear easy and suggests that everyone is doing it. Even though th
ey may be in great need and when the inner voice is pressuring them the most, Muslims would never lower themselves to do such a thing, regarding such a moral flaw as reprehensible. They would never touch money that was obtained illegally, and would never 
s
it at a table and eat food bought with forbidden money, no matter how hungry they were. Even being in such a situation would make them very uncomfortable. They would never assert that being in need was any justification for wrong behavior, for they know t
hat the important thing is always to carefully avoid what Allah has forbidden. They practice this precept with an inner sense of well-being and eager sincerity.
\par The Qur'an calls those Muslims who are eager to behave in ways that earn Allah's good pleasure "
those who race each other to the good." While striving to attain Allah's promised Paradise, Muslims experience peace and well-being from giving whatever and whenever they can and from being patient in every difficulty. For example, they may have Muslim fr
i
ends who are in need. So, they get up one sleepless morning and try to please their friends by supplying whatever they need. Most often the recipients of such good deeds do not know who did it, and the doers, pleased with their own moral conduct, would ne
ver let it be known if it caused them any difficulty.
\par Allah says that Muslims have a deep sense of pleasure in living according to the Qur'an's morality and find the opposite kind of behavior reprehensible:

 of everything, Satan tries to make it appear that all illegal activities are legitimate. To do this, Satan shows that those who do evil things are in the majority. A large number of people take forbidden money, pay no attention to what is permitted and w
h
at is not, and transgress the tenets of the Qur'an's morality. Thus, Satan always intimates the illogical idea that the majority is right and that what it does makes sense. But the Qur'an says that those who do evil deeds are not on the right path, even t
hough they are in the majority: "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 If you obeyed most of those on Earth, they would misguide you from Allah's Way. They follow nothing but conjecture...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 " (Surat al-An`am, 116). But, on the contrary, Allah says that only a small community of people has faith a
nd that the majority are on the wrong path. For this reason, Satan cannot fool believers but can only influence those whose belief is weak, whose minds are open to doubt and apprehension, and who openly reject Allah.
\par The attentiveness of devout Muslims com
es from their belief in Allah and the unwavering decisiveness that this belief brings with it, as well as from their superior moral character. Muslims know that good behavior is composed of acts that defy the lower self's voice. For example, when generosi
t
y, loyalty, patience, faithfulness, and other such high moral qualities are practiced, the lower self is disgusted. But the result of all this will be spiritual and material good. Living a life in this world and in the world to come in a state of contentm
e
nt with the rewards of moral purity is much better than acquiring all of the things that belong to this world and please the lower self. For example, people who refuse to listen to the lower self's persuasive tones to enter into an illegitimate relationsh
i
p, but who prefer to wait for their reward in the Hereafter, will enjoy honor and righteousness in this world. In the same way, those who go hungry or without sleep to supply the needs of a beloved Muslim friend, and who disregard the ensuing difficulties
, will be joyous in their hope to win Allah's good pleasure.
\par Muslims who ha
ve these fine moral qualities, all of which Allah praises in the Qur'an, also earn the believers' love and respect. If they work hard for Allah's cause and gladly confront every obstacle, if they act with untiring dedication to a just cause without fear o
f confrontation, and if they are willing to make every kind of self-sacrifice, the love and respect that others feel for them will increase severalfold. In the Qur'an, Allah refers to those who live according to His superior morality: }{\rtlch\fcs1

 fallen on hard times has no friends. This is a good expression of the common idea that you cannot find a real friend when you need one. However, friendship, loyalty, and faithfulness are very important in a person's life, for those who are in financial d
ifficulty or ill, or in need of spiritual support, want a real close friend at their side\emdash a friend who is a believer\emdash 
to help them. But since all relationships in non-religious societies are based on opportunism, unbelievers can never find a true friend. Onl
y when they are in trouble or need do people see the real face of those whom they had always considered to be their friends. Their supposed friends even give trouble to them in such difficult times. For example, people going through times of need complain
 that no relative calls, that they are left alone, and that no one gives them any support.

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 For example, a wealthy person who drives an expensive car and eats in gourmet restaurants generally has a wide circle of frien
ds, including many close ones. But if he loses his job and starts to work in a salaried position in his own factory, how will his relationships fare? Will his circle of friends show him the same love and respect that they did when he was rich? Will he be 
t
reated with the same interest, respect, and affection as when he wore expensive clothes and drove a luxury car? How will he be treated if he dresses modestly, does not throw his money around like he used to, and does not treat his friends to dinners? Clea
r
ly, he will not enjoy the same attention. Indeed, all of those whom he thought were his friends will turn their back on him. When they meet him, they will pretend not to see him or even might ridicule him. Actually, this person's spirit has not changed; o
nly his external appearance has changed. But because his erstwhile friends rely on outward material appearances, they abandon him in a moment, leaving him all by himself.
\par Take another example, that of a married couple. When they were married, they promised 
to stay together both in good times and bad. But what happens when the wife becomes paralyzed below the waist due to an accident and thus cannot walk or do anything for herself? What will her husband do? Perhaps he will stay with her for a while and help.
 
But when he realizes that this is a permanent situation and one from which he will never benefit, everything suddenly changes. This example clearly shows how unbelievers regard loyalty, fidelity, and friendship: When the profit goes, the connection ends. 
M
ost of those who do not abandon their spouse in such a situation stay because they are afraid of what their friends may think, not out of love and compassion for the handicapped spouse. On the surface, they appear dedicated and loyal, but they never feel 
real compassion and empathy for their spouse when he or she most needs it.
\par Another frequently encountered situation seen in unbelieving societies that are far from the Qur'an's morality is how young people behave toward their elderly parents. For years, the
ir families met their every need; but when their parents become old and their limbs do not support them any more, the young people do not show their parents the same loyalty and attention. They feel fettered by their elderly parents and usually put them i
n an old people's home.

e
n when they fall into desperate straits, they always do their best to fulfill their friends' needs before their own and take pleasure in their acts of self-sacrifice. When their friends are ill or in financial distress, they do not mind seeing to their ev

\par When Yusuf (as) was very young, his brothers threw him into a well and left him there to die. Those who found him sold him as a slave to an Egyptian vizier. Later, Yusuf (as) was fal
sely accused by the vizier's wife, arrested, and spent several years in prison, where he suffered many difficulties without ever compromising his moral character. Whenever something happened to him, he took refuge in Allah and thus turned his time in pris
on into a positive experience. He became an example for all believers with his trust, loyalty, and submission to Allah in all of his misfortunes. As a reward, Allah removed him from prison at a time of His choice and gave him power and wealth in Egypt.

arlier, we showed that whatever internal conditions exist, there is no alteration in a Muslim's moral character. Those who have no belief or have a sickness in their heart cannot stand difficult times, for their endurance is limited and they have a low bo
iling point. For this reason, they become very tense when they encounter difficulties and frustrations. Sometimes the slightest thing can trigger this tension, which causes them to become furious, shout, start a fight, fling insults, become aggressive, an
d
 resort to violence. People who are usually joyful, smiling, and easy-going under normal circumstances undergo a real character change in times of difficulty. They turn into aggressive, joyless, contrary, and sullen people. While Muslims talk patiently ab
out truth and beauty, unbelievers choose to go on the attack, thereby revealing their real face and character.
\par What reveals their real character may be their sudden unemployment, an illness, an accident, a disaster, or a misfortune. If they are homeless for
 two days or deprived of sleep, or if their accustomed comforts are removed, they become despondent. In the Qur'an, Allah describes the ungrateful character they display in times of difficulty:

The Muslims' understanding of the secret of these trials gives them a happiness and a sense of well-being, while those who are attached to this world live in great frustration, pain, and moral degeneration. While Muslims 
enjoy the fruits of their patience, those who are attached to what they believe is a world in which they will live forever are unaware that they are being tested and thus experience the frustration and pain of impatience, distrust, selfishness, meanness, 
a
nd worldly ambition. This pain shows itself in every moment of their lives. For example, there is a barrenness and joylessness in everything they do, as well as an inability to recognize what is good and to know the joy that a fine moral character brings.
 
\par They have neither honor nor moral character, and their lives are ruled by hypocrisy. Their greatest fault is that they think about themselves all the time. As a result, they think that being mean and selfish will benefit them and cannot see the harm that 
will result from such behavior. In fact, those who think in this way lose a great deal in both worlds, but are unaware of this fact. Unbelievers have lost the endless blessings of Paradise; but most importantly, they have lost Allah's good pleasure and me
rcy. As the Qur'an states, this is truly a great loss:

nd do not feed the poor and the needy. Even if they do help, they leave the recipient with a sense of obligation. The Qur'an's description of such people (e.g., those who are immoral, eat forbidden food, amass money without giving alms, and spend money in
 forbidden ways) awakens a reaction in believers.

As these verses reveal, the beauty of those with high morality increases while immorality covers the unbelievers' faces like the darkness of night. It is a necessity of this world of trials and testing that Allah reward all people acco

\par For example, if a visitor goes to an unbelievers' home, the hos
t's every action will make the guest uncomfortable. No matter how good the offered food may look, it does not appear so to a guest who knows his host's moral character and that his whole life is a violation of Allah's injunctions. Injustice done to orphan
s
 and the poor lie behind the food and drink offered. Believers will much prefer a stew made with legitimate money to a splendid meal paid for by money earned unlawfully. The guest may be invited to sit in an armchair. But if he knew how the money had been
 
earned to buy that chair, he would never want to sit in it. He would realize that everything in the house was acquired through the unjust exploitation of poverty-stricken women, children, and elderly persons. Even if everything were outwardly clean, there
 
would be a pervasive stench of spiritual corruption in the place that would make the guest uncomfortable. The Qur'an says that those who eat unlawful food and listen to liars will be humiliated in both worlds, and that other people will see their humiliat

These verses show the danger of abandoning faith to follow the wrong path. Such people spend a part of their lives believing in His existence and living according to His commands. But later on, their lower self leads them away from Allah's religion and in
t
o denial. As a result, they become irreligious, perhaps even more irreligious than others, because they had learned what was right, accepted and lived according to Allah's religion, but then had abandoned it. For this reason, all of their good works are c
o
mpletely cancelled. (Allah knows best)Therefore, people should not forget for even one moment that they are being tested in this world and that Satan will try to tempt them off the right path through various suggestions and doubts that these tests will ne
ver end. To deny Allah after believing in Him is the way to endless agony.
\par In addition, these people who reject belief live miserable lives. Even if they have attained a certain measure of material wealth and comfort, they suffer a spiritual pain for the re

Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was in
v
alidated by the scientific evidence of clear "design" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that Allah created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory o
f evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.
\par Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception i
n the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated
 
by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the
 origin of life. This "intelligent design" is a scientific expression of the fact that Allah created all living things.
\par We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and 
are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here.

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 , published in 1859. In this book, he denied that Allah created different living species on
 Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreove
r, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficult
ies. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. 
\par 2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.

erate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this
 "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to t

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life.
 The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had 
b
een widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mic
e would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies i
n the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publicati
on of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 The primary reason why the the
ory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our man-made technologi
cal products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 vol
umes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the in
formation coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San
 Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 Scientific American }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 magazine:

It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have
 to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i0\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 17}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663

\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663

\par Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natura
l conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individ
uals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses.

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this que
stion from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the
 
next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their neck
s were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\up4\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 19}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
\par However, the laws of in
heritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell o
ut of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, 
which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is 
Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an 
outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s17\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid198663 \rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af8\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f8\fs20\lang1033\langfe1055\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1055 {
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 
First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in
 a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would
 not be an improvement.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i0\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 20}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented 
as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." 
N
atural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "evolution" coul
d have taken place.

fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most "unscientific," are "extra-sensory perception"\emdash 
concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense\emdash and finally "human evolution." Zuckerman explains his reasoning:

ce we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this c
laim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphor
u
s, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutioni
sts what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrel
s. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids\emdash which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions\emdash 
and as many proteins\emdash a single one of which has a formation probability of 10-950\emdash 
as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremos
t scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do,
 
they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, ap
ples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par Briefly, uncon
scious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure und
er that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. 
\par The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par Before passing on to 
the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the 
brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely 
dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image for
med in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you
.
 Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional,
 
colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Agai
n
, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspecti
ve with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting
 on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the c
amera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance
, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been for
med by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, t
he middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 

\par Th
e situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, 
t
he sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete 
silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The resul
ts of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the sa

e sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you 
a
lways hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a h
i-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes hav
e no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-cente
red universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The rea
son is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of
 nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\cf1\insrsid2704427\charrsid198663 These are explicit statements that 
Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living spec
i
es (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary b
oth to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are work
s of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.

\par As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; such
 scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people, it i

 quite justifiable to speak of this theory as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from them

What has occupied your time over the years: worries about getting into the university of your choice, finding a good job, acquiring a suitable husband or wife, making lots of money \'85
? What have you struggled to achieve and acquire: fame, fortune, reputation \'85?
\par While seeking to meet your goals, have you eve
r considered the following truth: All of these goals are only temporary and impermanent, for you can take none of them with you when you die. After you die, what will happen to you? How will you fare in the Hereafter, where the only thing that will benefi
t you is how hard you worked while living in this world to earn Allah\rquote s good pleasure?
\par The Qur\rquote an states that this worldly life is a \'93testing ground\'94 that will determine each person\rquote s place in the eternal Hereafter. During these tests, we reveal to each oth
er and to Allah, Who already knows our ultimate destiny, who we really are.
\par Those who grasp this secret and live their lives knowing that they are being tested will gain an eternal and never-ending treasure: God\rquote s good pleasure in His eternal Paradise.
