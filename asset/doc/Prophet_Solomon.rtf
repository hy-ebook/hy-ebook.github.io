A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash and therefore, God's Existence\emdash 
over the last 140 years it ha
s caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think i
t appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explaine
d so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they ca
n be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of th
ese books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanat
ions based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
a
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names }{\i\f0\fs22\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Harun}{\f0\fs22\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  (Aaron) and }{

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is
 linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (May God bless him and grant him peace), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes 
it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the }{\i\f0\fs22\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 last word}{\f0\fs22\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
, so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expos
e godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French,
 German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, thes
e works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who
 
seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, i
t will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that
 clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from 
l
oss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the re
aders' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defe
at of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provi
ded speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

The Qur'an was sent down to humanity as a guide to the right path and for obtaining God's mercy. It gives important knowledge about what Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace) did, 
his message to unbelievers, and his struggle to spread God's religion. It also gives important information about the lives of Prophet Moses, Prophet Joseph, Prophet Jesus, Prophet Jonah, Prophet Lot , Prophet Noah, Prophet Shu'aib, and Prophet Salih (peac
e be upon them all). Like our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), they invited people to faith in God, warned them about the afterlife, and relayed true religion so that their people would adopt high moral standards. 
\par Its verses advise and admo
nish people by describing the prophets' high morality, sincere prayers, behavior in difficult circumstances, and determined efforts to fulfill their mission. In addition, it advises people to obey His prophets and follow the path that they have shown, and
 announces the good tidings that as people advance along the path, they will live without fear or sorrow in this world and the world to come (Qur'an, 7:35). The Qur'an informs us that God sends prophets for one purpose:

As this book explains, God bestowed a great kingdom, incomparable wealth, a mighty army supported by jinns and birds, and superior knowledge upon Prophet Solomon (pbuh). He rule
d justly throughout his life and, in his capacity as an administrator and a judge, brought many societies under his dominion. He was aware that God, Lord of the Worlds, is the true possessor of all knowledge, riches, and dominion, and so always turned to 
Him (Qur'an, 38:30), bowed to Him, and submitted to Him. 
\par This book will acquaint people with Prophet Solomon (pbuh), whom God made superior to other human beings, and analyze this chosen servant's exemplary moral qualities. As we examine what the Qur'an says about him, we will }{
\f0\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 see that each of his qualities can be related to our own lives. 
\par We will also study Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) story for information about the End Times, a period during which the Qur'an's moral teachings will prevail; all immorality, o
ppression, cruelty, injustice, and degeneration of the past eras will vanish; anxiety will be replaced by every kind of blessing, abundance, wealth, beauty, peace, and well-being; and technological developments will provide human beings with happiness and
 comfort. 
\par The hadiths contain many descriptions of the End Times. For example, God will destroy all atheistic philosophies and ideologies through the Mahdi, who will guide humanity to the right path, and bring all cruelty and chaos in the world to an end. 
The Mahdi's most important duty will be to restore religion to its original form under our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), make the Qur'an's moral teaching prevail, and establish global peace and well-being. In the hadith below, our Proph
et (may God bless him and grant him peace) draws our attention to a quality that is shared by the Mahdi, Prophet Solomon (pbuh), and Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh):

\f0\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 This hadith indicates that the Mahdi's rule will be similar to that of Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh). Therefore, we can gather important information about the End Times 
and the ensuing Golden Age by examining the Qur'anic accounts of Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) and Dhu'l-Qarnayn's (pbuh) reigns. (For more details about the connection between the time of Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh) and the End Times, consult Harun Yahya, }{

 [New Delhi: Goodword Books, 2004].) Developments in science and technology, as well as advances in economic and social life, that will be enjoyed in the End Times will be very similar to those mentioned in connection with Proph
et Solomon (pbuh). The Qur'anic account will allow believers to understand what is happening in the world from a broader perspective, and thereby open their horizons. One of this book's goals is to encourage people to think about these good tidings of the
 End Times and to share the joy and excitement that it will bring.

\par We can draw some important conclusions from this account:
\par Birds speak to one another on a special wave length that people cannot hear. God allowed Prophet Solomon (pbuh) to understand these conversations. This might have been made possible by technological means. 
\par Since Prophet Solomon (pbuh) could understand these conversations, he may have given them special tasks to fulfill. (God knows the truth.) 
\par Prophet Solomon (pbuh) achieved important results by using birds to both carry messages and gather information. This knowledge facilitated communication with other countries and reaching distant areas. (God knows the truth.)
\par This verse may be drawing our attention to a superior technology similar to that which will be used in the End Times. In fact, these birds may not even refer to birds as we know them, but perhaps to unmanned aircrafts. 
\par Besides this, he may have attached transmitters to them to obtain information about other countries and his enemies. In this way, he could have obtained images and sound recordings and used the information to govern his kingdom. 
\par 
\par Prophet Solomon (pbuh) had power over jinns and demons, for the Qur'an states: }{\b\f0\cf1\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 "\'85 And some of the jinns worked in front of him by his Lord's permission\'85"}{

\par 
\par The Qur'an is valid for all people until the end of the world. Therefore, similar things that
 happened during Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) reign may also be experienced in the End Times. For example, God may put these jinns under humanity's control once again. Again, the advanced technology indicated in this account may be a signal of what technology
 will bring to humanity in the End Times. (God knows the truth)

Prophet Solomon (pbuh) showed us how Muslims should look at wealth and possessions: Aware of their true owner, Muslims must consider their wealth and possessions as no more than a means to remember God. Muslims who realize this great tr

Prophet Solomon (pbuh) loved wealth, which he used to seek God's good pleasure, and wanted even more so that he could offer even more service to God. Muslims should follow this example if they find themselves in a similar situation.

Muslims can have great wealth, magnificent possessions, and wonderful works of art. Indeed, throughout history Muslim empires were characterized by such traits. The most obvious example is the Ottoman Empi
re, which was Islam's standard bearer for several centuries and left its architectural and other artistic works throughout its vast realm.

One reason for the believers' wealth is that wealth plays a major role in turning people's hearts to Islam. The be
lievers' splendid possessions attract those who are far removed from religious morality and give too much value to material things. After meeting individual believers, their interest in religion is awakened. As we shall see in this book, this was one of t
he methods used by Prophet Solomon (pbuh) to get the Queen of Saba to accept Islam.

a metaphysical way, God may have taken him from the material world to the spiritual world. Perhaps there is no matter in the spiritual world, which could have led Prophet Solomon (pbuh) to understand that his throne and the corpse were not material things

Prophet Solomon (pbuh) used his letter to explain His religion and then invite the people of Sab
a to belief in God. He did not want to subjugate them to himself; rather, he wanted to lead them toward God so that they might become Muslims. This shows that he was more interested in their belief system than in conquering Saba, because he was sent to in
vite people to the true path and warn them.

These verses inform us of the relations between Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Saba, and that achieved his goals through diplomacy instead of war. Using letters and envoys, he sought to open relations and encourage mutual understanding and peace.

This method of communication also reveals an important fact: Oral communication may be forgotten and be ineffective due to many distractions in the local environment. Also, people may not be able to express themselves cl
early while talking, or those listening to them may become distracted. However, a written document helps both the writer and the reader to focus their attention on what is being said. Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) method of communication shows that he understo
od this. It must be remembered that the written word is an important way of relaying the reality of belief and the truth of God's religion.

The Qur'an does not contain much information about the prophets' deaths. However, it does relate some important details about Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) death. For example, at the moment of his 
death he was surrounded by jinns who probably were trying to complete their assigned tasks. Not realizing that he was dead, they continued to work. This verse suggests that the jinns do not have any true knowledge of the Unseen, for if they did, they woul
d have stopped working. As this verse emphasizes the words }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 humiliating punishment,}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
 they were working very hard on a task and were afraid of Prophet Solomon (pbuh). Thus, they did not stop when he died as they did not realize he was dead until the staff broke.

aken after agreement was secured among all levels of government, and there was mutual respect and freedom of conscience. It seems to have been a model in which rights were protected.

According to historical sources, Saba was one of the four great civilizations of southern Arabia. Its inhabitants were a sophisticated people who had reached a high level of technology, as we can tell from the Ma'rib dam, one of their most important achie
vements. As the Sabaeans were establishing their civilization, they built this dam and began to irrigate the surrounding land, and develop a very comfortable lifestyle.
\par The Ma'rib dam was 16 meters (52 feet) high, 60 meters (196 feet) wide, and 620 meters (
2,034 feet) in length. Scholars estimate that it irrigated 9,600 hectares of land: 5,300 hectares on the southern plain and 4,300 hectares on the northern plain. Sabaean inscriptions sometimes refer to these two plains as "Ma'rib and the two plains."11}{

one to the right and one to the left"}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
 probably means these vines and gardens that stretched across two valleys. This dam, as well as the irrigation water it supplied to the surrounding land, made the area famous as the best irrigated and most productive land in southern Arabia.
\par The extensive repairs made during the fifth and sixth centuries CE did not prevent its collapse in 542. The ensuing flood, which the Qur'an calls the }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Arim flood,}{
\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  destroyed the Sabaeans' vineyards, gardens, and farms that they had cultivated for centuries. The Saba kingdom then entered a period of rapid decline and gradually disappeared. 
\par Archeological finds and historical sources corroborate this event. The Qur'an speaks of the }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Sayl al-'Arim}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  (i

dam or barricade.}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  So, }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Sayl al-'Arim}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
 indicates that the flood happened because the dam collapsed.
\par German archeologist Werner Keller, author of }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Und die Bible Hat Doch Recht}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  (The Holy Book Was Right), accepted th
e Qur'anic account of this flood and wrote that the existence of such a dam and the destruction of the whole kingdom by its collapse proves that the Qur'an's example of the people of the garden was indeed realized.12
\par The Ma'rib dam, which now has become a 
desolate ruin, is a lesson for all people who, like the Sabaeans, are ungrateful for God's blessings and so deserve His punishment. In a moment, all of their wealth was gone. (For a detailed discussion, see Harun Yahya, }{

\par Throughout this book, we have been considering Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) wealth, artistic understanding, and some of his other characte
ristics. We have spoken of his magnificent palace, which left everyone who saw it in awe, and of the works of art he commanded the jinns and demons under his command to create. We have related that some of them were builders and divers and knew how to mak

\par Earlier, we mentioned that Prophet Solomon (pbuh), just like his father Prophet David (pbuh), was sent to the Tribe of Israel. He warned them and invited them to live a goo
d moral life. For this reason, there is much information about Prophet Solomon (pbuh) in the Old Testament. 
\par The Old Testament contains the Torah revealed to Prophet Moses (pbuh), the Psalms given to Prophet David (pbuh), and other books believed either to
 have been written by various Jewish prophets or telling of their lives. Jews believe in the entire Old Testament, whereas Christians accept the Old Testament [but not the religious ritual and legal life that it commands all Jews to obey] with the added N
ew Testament, which contains the four Gospels that recount a few incidents of Prophet Jesus' life, some letters written by St. Paul to the young Christian communities, and the letters of other early Christian figures.
\par The Qur'an reveals that the earlier rev
ealed books were corrupted. However, a number of rules and practices belonging to the true religion have been preserved in these books. The Muslims' only guides to determining which elements in the religions revealed before Islam belong to the true religi
on, as well as those that have been corrupted, are those that are found in the Qur'an and the Sunnah of our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace).
\par  The Old Testament contains many stories about Prophet Solomon (pbuh), especially his power, superio
r wisdom, and strong belief. These stories are all in perfect conformity with what is said in the Qur'an. The Old Testament mentions that Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) kingdom consisted of all the land between the Nile and the Euphrates rivers. To possess such
 a vast territory in Mesopotamia, the region's cultural and economic center at that time, and to have the strength to govern surrounding nations, as in the case of Saba, is indeed an indication of great political power. 
\par Besides this, the information given in the Old Testament about Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) wealth, his temple's construction, the people who helped him, the materials he used, and its size.

cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape. The height of each cherub was ten cubits. He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched o

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Earlier, we considered various signs of the End Times in the Qur'an's account of Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) l
ife. We said that, in the End Times, there would be a Golden Age in which Islamic morality would be foremost, and that this period would be ushered in by the Mahdi, who bears title }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
al-Hadi}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  (the one who guides).
\par The hadiths of our Prophet (may God bless him
 and grant him peace) reveal signs of these two periods. And, when we compare them with what is happening today, we see many indications that we are living in the End Times and that the Golden Age is about to come. 
\par The hadiths characterize the End Times a
s a treacherous period in which the number of wars and conflicts will increase and the world will be in general chaos because of the moral degeneration arising from people's rebellion against religious morality. Natural disasters will be everywhere, pover
t
y will reach a previously unknown level, crime rates will soar, and murder and massacre will follow each other in an apparently endless succession. But this is only the first stage of the End Times; in the second stage, God will use the Mahdi to rescue pe
ople from this chaos.
\par Indeed, such events have happened numerous times in human history, for wars, earthquakes, and other natural disasters have been common. The same is true of moral degeneration, poverty, and hunger. What distinguishes the signs of the En
d Times from these events is that all of these signs will happen in the same period one after the other, and in the way described in the hadiths. Here we must give the glad tidings that this chaos will be temporary, for the coming of the Golden Age will b
ring this distressing period to an end. 
\par The Golden Age will be a time when wars and conflicts will end, all irreligious ideologies that caused so much misery will be buried in the dark recesses of history, and the world will enjoy a period of justice and a
bundant blessings. Islamic morality will spread throughout the world, and people will stream toward religion. As we stated earlier, some of the hadiths describe this dominance of Islamic morality, such as when our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him 
peace) speaks of the similarities between this period and the reigns of Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh). Some of these are as follows:

\par 
\par In this hadith, our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) announced that the Mahdi will come during a period of changing systems. This probably refers to communism, which was widespread before collapsing in the late 1980s.
\par This atheistic philosophy, the product of materialist philosophy, was one of the main reasons for the bloody wars and massacres that marked the twentieth century. This ideology influenced large parts of Europe, Asia, South Am
erica, and Africa. Many countries were ruled by communist regimes for decades or were targeted by communist organizations. Communism was one of the reasons for the cold war, which continued from the late 1940s until the early 1990s, and for the cruelest m
assacres. 
\par Besides fighting with other countries to extend their ideology, communists subjected their own people to great cruelty, mass executions, and massacre. Moreover, they put people to death in forced labor camps and killed them by starvation.
\par Accordi
ng to various historians' calculations, communist regimes were responsible for the deaths of 120 million people during the twentieth century. Most of these were not soldiers who died in battle, but were civilians murdered by communists. Tens of millions o
f
 men, women, old people, children, and babies lost their lives because of the communists' brutal savagery. Apart from this, millions of people were oppressed and forced to leave their homes and countries. Their lands and possessions were confiscated, and 
they were made to live every moment in fear of being killed, falsely arrested, or subjected to cruelty.
\par But toward the end of the twentieth century, these regimes, which seemed to be so strong and firm, began to lose their power and crumble one by one. The 
clearest symbol of this collapse was the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Two years later, the world's largest and most powerful communist state\emdash the Soviet Union\emdash 
collapsed and the Eastern Bloc completely fell apart. Communist regimes from Africa to
 Central Asia collapsed one after another, the bipolar world order that had been firmly in place since 1945 disappeared, and, according to political commentators, a new world order replaced it. With these very surprising developments, the }{
\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 change of system}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  mentioned in the hadith came about.
\par Today, as the last ideological and political traces of communism, and the totalitarian fascist system based on the same ideas, disappear, the world is being totally cleansed of these bloody ideologies. With the spread of
 Islamic morality throughout the world, the oppression, suffering, darkness, and poverty that these systems imposed on millions of people will be truly ended, and people will have beauty, wealth, happiness and well-being. And after distress, darkness, war
, massacre, and suffering, God, in His mercy and kindness, will give people His incomparable blessings.

\par This hadith indicates that before the Mahdi comes, rulers in some Muslim states will be far removed from religious morality, cruel and pitiless, or ineffective. Indeed, we can see this in such 
countries as Iraq, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Somalia, Tunisia, Libya, Ethiopia, and Syria. All of the Muslims in these countries are oppressed by their governments and subjected to difficulty and anxiety. They cannot live their religion freely and perform th
eir prayers, and economic restrictions make their lives difficult. Below are some examples of what these people have experienced: 
\par In Iraq, which lost about one million soldiers out of a total of three million during its war with Iran, the fascist Ba'thist dictator Saddam Hussein subjected the Iraqi people to incredible torture and oppression. 
\par Since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, the country has been unstable and chaotic. Those in power have not been true representatives of Islam; rather, they founded an oppressive, intolerant, and pitiless system.
\par Between 1977-91, the tiny African country of Djibouti was ruled by a brutal regime that killed about 2 million Muslims and falsely arrested and tortured 7,000 people. 
\par Between 1969-91, Major General Siad Barre led an oppressive regime in Somalia that targeted Muslims. 
\par For 31 years, Tunisia was governed by the dictatorial regime of Habib Bourguiba. He declared himself }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 president of the republic for life}{
\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187  and, while in power, oppressed his subjects. For example, he tried to ban the fast of Ramadan on the grounds that it hurt national production figures.
\par During the 30 years of Hafez al-Assad's dictatorship, Syrian Muslims were subjected to various acts of c
ruelty. After some massacres, women were raped and men were tortured. The most atrocious example act of his rule was his decision to bomb and destroy Aleppo (city in northwestern Syria) when it revolted against his rule in early 1982. An untold number of 
people were killed.

nd and heart from justice and right. It can also refer to war, savagery, confusion, conflict, and discord. This hadith says that dust and smoke will be left after this tribulation. This tribulation might be }{

\par When we look at it from this angle, this hadith probably refers to the 9/11 attack against New York and Washington, DC. As we saw on television and in newspapers, large clouds of dust followed these two acts of terrorism and wrapped the areas in smoke. 

\par According to the official account, aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The ensuing explosions, caused by their fuel, caused a great cloud to form. Smoke rose so high and spread so far that it could be seen throughout N
ew York City and even in surrounding towns. The collapse of the World Trade Center and the nearby Building Number 7 after the explosions caused an even larger cloud of dust to cover all people in the affected area from head to toe.
\par This event is extremely important, because it occurred within the same period as other signs and is similar to what is described in the hadiths. Therefore, this most deplorable terrorist act may be the }{

\par 
\par In the great majority of the hadiths in which our Prophet (may
 God bless him and grant him peace) mentions the Mahdi's coming, he stresses that the world will be in a state of general chaos, insecurity, and anxiety before he comes. Along with wars and conflicts, another characteristic of this period will be mass mur
der. The hadith given above draws our attention to this last characteristic. 
\par Historians estimate that both world wars killed about 65 million people. They also estimate that during the twentieth century, more than 180 million people were killed for politic
al reasons. This is an extraordinary figure when compared with similar figures for previous centuries. Until the twentieth century, most of the wars were largely local conflicts fought by opposing armies along a particular line or front. However, twentiet
h
-century developments in weapons technology and military strategy, as well as the prevalence of ideologies that favored violence and bloodshed, made both the idea and the actual implementation of total war feasible. Now governments target not only the opp
o
sing army on the front, but also civilians behind the front. Sometimes, there is not even a front to separate the two sides. The twentieth century saw cities bombed (e.g., carpet bombing); chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons used; genocide campaigns
 implemented with impunity; and concentration and forced labor camps built to hold various unwanted groups of people. 
\par If we look at recent history, we see many instances of massacres. For example, the Serbs targeted mainly Bosnian civilians. Thousands of p
eople were killed, including women, children, and the elderly. The mass graves discovered after the war show the dimensions of the massacres in horrible detail. 
\par The ethnic cleansing campaign directed against the Palestinians since the 1940s is a more long
-term policy of mass murder. Instances of this policy, like the slaughters at Sabra and Shatila in 1982, overseen by now-prime minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, show the dimensions of this policy. 
\par Africa has experienced frequent violent ethnic conflict in which thousands of people have lost their lives. In the spring of 1994, a conflict occurred between two large tribes\emdash 
the Hutu and the Tutsi (slightly less than 15 percent of the nation's population)\emdash that involved five countries\emdash Zaire, Rwanda, Uganda, Burun
di, and Tanzania. Nearly 800,000 people died in this ethnic conflict. Tens of thousands of refugees had to contend with destitution and epidemics in the forests; many of them died. Small children and babies were savagely slaughtered just because they belo
nged to another tribe.

\par The hadiths concerning the Mahdi's coming speak of widespread slaughter in which innocent people are especially targeted. As we know, in almost every conflict today the basic ta
rget is innocent civilians, mainly women, children, and the elderly. Since civilians do not have the means to defend themselves, vast numbers of people are killed. 
\par Besides these massacres, recent terrorist activities have focused on the mass eradication of }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 unwanted}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

 When we consider these meanings, we realize that this is an accurate description of the twentieth century, a time when war quickly spread to man
y nations, and when conflict, civil war, and chaos began and still continues today. Unfortunately, such violence still continues in the twenty-first century.
\par When we analyze the outbreaks of violence since the 1970s, we can see that when corruption ends in
 one place, it begins in another. During this period, conflict and civil strife occurred in many countries and regions: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Palestine, Israel, North Korea, Cambodia, Eastern Tur
kistan (Xinjiang [northwestern China]), Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen, Uganda, Algeria, Rwanda, Mozambique, Angola, Congo, Liberia, Burundi, Sudan, Lebanon, Argentina, Northern Ireland, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. 
\par World history is full of war and conflict, but 
those that occurred in the twentieth century are unique. First, the numbers of dead far surpassed the total of deaths in all other centuries. Second, until then war had always regional and restricted to a certain region. But in the twentieth century, it s
pread over the entire world. It seems that, in the last century, no country or region was immune from conflict or terrorism.
\par Third, the power of weapons is almost beyond human comprehension. The use of nuclear and chemical weapons inflicted unbelievable sla
ughter on the generation that lived through these conflicts, and succeeding generations continue to be affected by the long-term negative side effects. The first event that comes to mind in this regard is the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 19
45.
\par Today, one of the most threatening kinds of warfare is biological warfare. An example of this happened after the 9/11 terrorist attack, when letters containing the anthrax bacteria were sent to important addresses; to date, several people have died beca
use of such letters.

\par Up to this point, we have f
ocused on Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) exemplary life and moral character, faithfulness toward God, and how he turned toward Him in everything he did. We have mentioned his courage, just dealings, and tolerance, as well as his forgiving, courteous, welcoming,
 
peace-loving, and noble character. In addition, we have studied his methods of state administration and intelligence gathering, along with his diplomatic successes, public building, and artistic undertakings. We then looked at Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh), a fait
hful servant who shared many similarities with Prophet Solomon (pbuh). 
\par All of this information shows that Prophet Solomon (pbuh) was engaged in artistic and scientific work about which we know nothing and cannot even guess. This great leader and Prophet ma
de extraordinary advancements in various scientific and other fields in his day. Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh) also established dominion over a vast territory and governed societies with superior knowledge. 
\par Another thing we considered while examining these account
s was the signs of the End Times that they contain. As we know from the hadiths, the Golden Age will be a time of extraordinary development in science, art, and technology, just as in the days of Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh). Although t
he other two periods have passed and the Golden Age is still to come, all of them are realities announced to us by God. 
\par The term }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Mahdism}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
 connotes the establishment of these two leaders' superior morality on a new, different, and broader foundation. In othe
r words, the spirituality, logic, intelligence, and social manifestation of Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Dhu'l-Qarnayn (pbuh) will reveal themselves in society in the End Times. 
\par These three periods are characterized by the prevalence of Islamic morality thr
oughout their realms. God approves of all three of these periods. The times of Nebuchadnezzar II, Nimrod, and Pharaoh were governed by Satan and therefore were irreligious periods. Just as God made Islamic morality prevail after these periods, in the End 
T
imes our Lord will let His servants live under the rule of that same morality. This will be the Golden Age, which will be characterized by happiness, well-being, love, brotherhood, loyalty, peace, self-sacrifice, humanity, and helpfulness. Below are some 
examples of the similarity between the three times.

We have already seen the various kinds of knowledge that God gave Prophet Solomon (pbuh): how to rule over jinns and demons, speak to birds, hear and understand ants talking among themselves, and subject the winds and copper to his command. All of these w

\par Throughout this book, we have spoken of the incomparable blessings that God gave to Prophet Solomon (p
buh) and of the superior knowledge that He never gave to anyone before. Everyone who has read it carefully will have found in Prophet Solomon's (pbuh) life story some sound advice and interesting signs that are relevant to the present day. 
\par Prophet Solomon
 (pbuh) was an ideal statesman, and every Muslim should take him as an example in the areas of justice, modesty, sincerity, intelligence, prudence, patience, and decisiveness. Everyone who follows his example will meet with success both in this world and 
the next.
\par As we said earlier, Dhu'l Qarnayn (pbuh), just like Prophet Solomon (pbuh), had great power and dominion. God gave him }{\b\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 
"power and authority in the land and granted him a way to everything" }{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 (Qur'an, 18:84). Everywhere he went, he brought people hap
piness, justice, and security. In addition, he made God's religion supreme throughout his realm. Muslims should do their best to emulate this powerful, decisive, and faithful person. (For more detailed information, see Harun Yahya, }{
\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Signs of the End Times in Surat al-Kahf [New Delhi; Goodword Books, 2004]}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 .)
\par God sent these guides to inform people of the true path. If believers take these great people's lives and morality as an example, and desire only to win God's good pleasure, they will no doubt attain great success and victory. 
\par Today, one sign after another of Islamic morality's emerging dominance is taking place. All over the world, people are turning toward God in great numbers. The most-read newspapers in the world contain news items about this developm
ent, and there are now many thousands of new Muslims. Islamic morality invites all people to peace, tolerance, and happiness. As it becomes better known, this movement will surely grow even stronger.
\par From these developments, we can understand that, God wil
ling, Islamic morality's global dominance may happen quickly under the leadership of a strong nation. Even many Western politicians and strategists have begun to speak of this. Today's centers of conflict and chaos (e.g., the Balkans, Central Asia, the Ca
ucasus, and the Middle East) will, by means of the peace and happiness flowing from Islamic morality, be rescued from the chaos in which they are drowning.
\par God willing, the twenty-first century will be a blessed time, in which Islamic morality will give direction to the world.}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid12397537

 them for the advantage of true religion is certainly an indication that he was one of God's greatest servants.

"
 in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of 
the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.
\par Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and mo

i
n particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This "intelligent design" is a scienti
fic expression of the fact that God created all living things.
\par We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importa

s had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book 
titled "Difficulties on Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific find
ings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. 
\par 2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.

s and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theor

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science
 in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly b
e
lieved that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while
. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the 
naked eye.

, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur anno
unced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from 
the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."}{\f0\up6\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 16}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cel
l cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.

\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the
 information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help o
f some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life
 originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 So, how coul
d these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living crea
t
ures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from ant
elopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 The Origin of Species}{\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

\par However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were
 passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo
-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural 
mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, 
and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

ndom, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be 
a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\f0\fs22\up6\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 24}{\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

etic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do not
hing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "evolution" could have taken place.

the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance.
 According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such
 
as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the 
behalf of evolutionists what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magne
sium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids\emdash 
which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions\emdash and as many proteins\emdash a single one of which has a formation probability of 10-}{\f0\up6\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 950}{
\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 \emdash as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let 
them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No 
m
atter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, 
b
ananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of 
them. 
\par Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own
 cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with God's superior creation. 
\par The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of evolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spo
t at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its 
inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch d
arkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head
 and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is
 
a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made f
o
r this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-
dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to wat
ch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of t
he eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed 
as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye co
uld not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them
 
to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hea
ring in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely si
lent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at t
hat moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders,
 high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound pe
r
ceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the m
u
sic starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly
 as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolut

onary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe
 model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that 
this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.

\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists tha
t
 millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate m
atter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the supe
rstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible.
\par As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning profess
ors and university students; such scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this n

 and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with the incredible credulity that it has.}{\f0\fs22\up6\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 35}{\f0\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187

\f0\lang1024\langfe1024\noproof\insrsid6168250\charrsid13242187 That future is not far off: On the contrary, people will soon see that "chance" is not a deity, and will look back on the theory of evolution as the worst deceit and 
the most terrible spell in the world. That spell is already rapidly beginning to be lifted from the shoulders of people all over the world. Many people who see its true face are wondering with amazement how they could ever have been taken in by it.

 blessed Prophet Solomon (pbuh) with a great kingdom, incomparable wealth, a powerful army supported by jinns and birds, and superior wisdom. This book looks at his special God-given qualities, as described in the Qur'an, that made him superior to other h
uman beings. Such a study enables us to consider the exemplary moral character of this chosen servant of our Lord.
\par Given that many aspects of Prophet Solomon\rquote s (pbuh) biography are connected with the End Times, we also examine this period. The End Times, which is drawing ever-closer and during which the Qur\rquote an\rquote 
s moral teachings will prevail, will witness the coming of the Mahdi. This spiritual person, an agent of God, will destroy all false philosophies and ideologies, thereby bringing an end to the oppression and chaos seen all over the world.
\par The hadiths state that the world rule in the End Times will be very much like the reigns of Prophet Solomon (pbuh) and Dhu\rquote l-Qarnayn (pbuh). For this reason, the author examines the Qur\rquote anic accounts of the times of th
ese two great leaders from this point of view. This method will allow believers to interpret events from a wider perspective and broaden their horizons. In addition, it will cause Muslims to think about the good tidings of the End Times and live in eager 
expectation of its arrival.

The author, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has 
published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. His main focus has been the refutation of Darwinism and materialism, two modern myths presented under a scientific guise. Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, Muslims a
nd non-Muslims alike, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the readers\rquote 
 perspective by encouraging them to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of God and His unity, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems.
