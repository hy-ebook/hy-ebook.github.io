The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 9\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
80s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cove\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (saas), the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to dispr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ve each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sig
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of his intention of saying this last word.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in Engl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ish, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers worldwide. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any one who r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerel
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in human\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Allah, render an invaluable service.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a gr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
at effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point shou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ld be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 peedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the 21st century wil\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to a

 father loved Yusuf (as) and his brother more which led them to this jealousy. They wanted a love directed only towards themselves, and thought, because of their numbers and the way that they encouraged one another, that they had a greater right to that l

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This is clearly a most twisted way of thinking. According to the Qur'an, the real measure of a believer's love is the degree to which it is motivated by God concsiousness. Whoever is most conscious of Allah has most fear of Him and scrupulously remains
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 within the limits of behaviour set by Him. Hence, the people they love the most are those who exhibit the most upright moral values. That is the believer's concept of love. It is evident that Prophet Ya'qub (as) adopted that same criterion when giving lo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e to his sons. It is perfectly natural that since Prophet Yusuf (as) was more God fearing and possessed higher moral values than his other sons he should have loved him most. However, since Prophet Yusuf's brothers (as) did not share that perspective they
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 were unable to understand the love their father felt for Yusuf (as) and their youngest brother. This is an important indicator of how far their characters had deviated from their religion.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another aspect of their behaviour that is worthy of note is the dis\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
respectful way they treated their father. Despite their father being a chosen prophet and a man of superior intelligence and understanding, they claimed that their father was "clearly making a mistake" because of his love for Yusuf (as) and his brother. T
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is impudence towards a prophet shows just how weak their faith was. Furthermore, the way they attempted to kill Prophet Yusuf (as) is proof again of the weakness of their faith and their mischief-making natures. It is quite evident that nobody who fears A
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lah, who believes he will have to account for his actions in the hereafter, and who knows that Allah sees and hears him at every moment could ever favour taking such a course of action, and would never even consider it for a moment. Yet in order to make t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eir father love them or to satisfy their feelings of jealousy, these men believed the answer was to kill Prophet Yusuf (as) or abandon him somewhere on the road.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Killing is in any case a sin, and abandoning a young child by the roadside is a wicked action.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 People who could even consider doing such a thing clearly have no conscience or sense of compassion. Prophet Yusuf's brothers (as) were therefore, cruel and ruthless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Their thought processes were also totally defective. They hoped that after committing su\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ch a sin and doing such a wicked thing to Yusuf (as) they could still remain one of those "who do right." Of course if someone truly wishes Allah to forgive him after he has transgressed he may still hope to amend his ways and be one of the God fearing. H
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
wever, these men hoped to remain one of the God fearing even in the full knowledge that their actions were wrong. This is another piece of evidence that they lacked the power of reason and the character of the true believer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It can be seen in the continuat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion of the verse that in moments of extreme peril Allah assisted Prophet Yusuf (as), inspiring his brothers to throw him down a well instead of murdering him:

their father felt regarding them. The fact they came weeping was a clear sign of the corruptness of their behaviour. The fact is that such a weak attitude is one that no believer could ever accept. Since believers know that there is good and auspiciousnes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  in everything, they never fall into the weakness of lamenting or complaining, no matter what may befall them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, the lamentation engaged in by Yusuf's brothers was of the kind that those of a hypocritical character employ. Using tears as a weapon \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to deceive the other side is one of the mischief-makers' cunning techniques. In this way they try to make other people feel sorry for them and portray themselves as helpless. They try to give the impression that they are trustworthy when they are really n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thing of the sort. This is an unchanging feature of the character of the mischief-maker down the ages. The fact is that Yusuf's brothers felt not the slightest twinge of conscience as they flung their brother, a small child, into the depths of the well, y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t when the time came to give an account of themselves they came weeping into their father's presence. It is obvious that they were quite insincere and that their tears were put on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This situation is a means for believers to gain valuable insights. When car\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eful attention is paid to the lie the brothers made up about Prophet Yusuf (as), the concern expressed by Prophet Ya'qub (as) is perfectly understandable. His sons had come with excuses, just as he himself had said. Prophet Ya'qub (as) had clearly express
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d his concerns in his earlier words, saying that he was afraid of Yusuf (as) being eaten by a wolf. His sons, true to the character of mischief-makers, incorporated that concern into the lie they told to their father after throwing Yusuf (as) down the wel
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. They thought that their father might thus be more likely to believe them. The lesson that believers need to draw from this story is to avoid expressing their sincere doubts or concerns within earshot of mischief-makers. This is because, as we have seen 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n this example, they might use the believers' sincere words against them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As can be seen from the continuation of the verse, they were actually aware that their father did not believe them. This situation results from a state of mind that applies not just \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to Prophet Yusuf's brothers, but to everyone of a hypocritical nature. Those who set snares for believers feel themselves in a permanent state of guilt. They can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

The above verse emphasises two further points. The first is the way that his brothers collaborated as they threw Prophet Yusuf (as) into the well. Perhaps they imagined they could assume joint r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
esponsibility for the act but their thinking was very mistaken. Rather, their behaviour merely proves that they shared a common lack of conscience since not one of them stood out against the course of action they had taken.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One may conclude from this not o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nly that troublemakers are capable of taking organised action against believers, but that they also constitute the perfect material for mass communal protests.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, it can be seen in the above verse that Allah assisted Prophet Yusuf (as) by means of H\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is revelation, giving him news of the future even at what appeared to be his darkest hour. This is in itself a miracle. Looking at this from the point of view of Prophet Yusuf (as), this was a great blessing. Receiving a revelation from Allah when he was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
bout to be thrown into the well and receiving Allah's reassurance was the greatest help and support that he could possibly have. In other words, right from the moment he was thrown into the well, Prophet Yusuf (as) knew by Allah's revelation to him that a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l their snares would come to nothing. He was secure and at peace because of his trust in Allah's promise. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, it must not be forgotten that a sincere believer always places himself in Allah's hands, no matter what the difficulties and tribulations he\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 faces, even if he is given no revelation, and accepts whatever happens. That is because Allah has informed the believers that He will always be by their side:

Allah may have great difficulties and be wracked by doubts in such circumstances. Yet despite all this, Prophet Yusuf (as) was patient and submissive to the will of Allah. This is a clear indication of his superior consciousness. It is also obvious from t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e fact that he was tested in this way at such an early age meant that he would grow up to be one of the chosen ones, since only those who are sincerely devoted to Allah}{\f0\insrsid146565

ourse a most astonishing situation. Maybe it was the woman's confidence in her position in Egypt, in her wealth, and the fact that Prophet Yusuf (as) was her slave, that impelled her to commit this sin. This was a most depraved suggestion, and Aziz's wife

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Q\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ur'an also relates how Aziz raised no objection to Prophet Yusuf (as) being thrown into the dungeon, even though he had seen all the evidence. In the same way his wife turned a blind eye to Yusuf's years of imprisonment (as). As can be seen from this exam
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

they set for others. As they lay their snares, Allah hears and knows everything they say, their decisions and innermost feelings, down to the finest detail. In fact, the fact that they will set snares for believers was already enshrined in their destinies
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
long before they were even born. Allah had also determined in their destinies those events that would bring their traps to nothing. For that reason, every trap set for believers comes into being as a failure. Allah reveals this secret in the Qur'an:

 cunning traps to succeed, and that He eventually causes the truth to surface. This is an important point, because the slanders against Prophet Yusuf (as) came to light by Allah's permission. The ruler and the people learned the truth at the moment and in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the manner Allah desired. The destiny Allah determined went into effect and gave rise to the best and most favourable scenario.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet what Prophet Yusuf (as) says in the above verses is also most important. Despite the truth being out in the open, his being \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the victim of an obvious slander, his spending so many years in prison and being a servant raised to the status of prophet by Allah, Prophet Yusuf (as) did not attempt to deny the vulnerability of his own lower self. He also revealed another most importan
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  truth here; "The self indeed commands to evil acts \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 \hich\f0  except for those my Lord has mercy on\'85\loch\f0 
" This is something that believers need to bear in mind at every moment of their lives. That is because every human being has earthly desires, and all people are t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sted at every moment throughout their lives. One's desires may sometimes clash with one's conscience, and a person will listen to the one or the other. Believers strive with the very greatest determination to heed the voice of their consciences which call
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 them to what is pleasing to Allah, while other people live at the mercy of their desires.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a believer loses sight of his task and succumbs to his desires he must repent and be more on his guard against the evils of those desires. That is because, as Alla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h has informed us in the Qur'an by means of the words of Prophet Yusuf (as), earthly desires always command one to commit evil acts.

To recall, Prophet Yusuf (as) had gone to Egypt as a slave, after which he had been thrown into a dungeon on the ugly and baseless charge of lusting after a woman. However, Allah brought about a change that would h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ave appeared "impossible" on the surface, making Prophet Yusuf (as) a man whose word counted in the Egyptian government. Bringing to pass that which on the face of it might seem quite impossible, belongs to the realm of Allah's wisdom and vastness. As we 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 re informed in the Qur'an: }{\b\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "How many a small force has triumphed over a much greater one by Allah's permission!"}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
We are thus reminded that the possessions and rank conferred in this world are of no importance, and that what we need to set our sights on is the hereafter. However, in the final sentence of the verse, as we are reminded of this matter and informed that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 late any possible dangers and take the appropriate precautions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At the same time, however, Prophet Ya'qub (as) again reminds us of the essence behind everything. He says that it is Allah who lays this down, that if Allah wills something there is no way to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
prevent it and that it is necessary to submit to His will. These are exceedingly valuable reminders. Here can be seen the idea of submission to the will of Allah that Muslims need to adopt in its fullest sense. The popular ideas of fate and submission are
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
actually mistaken. Some people imagine that events arise because of measures that they have taken, or that they can cause other things to happen. Others possess a mistaken concept of submission to the will of Allah, along the lines of, "What is going to h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ppen is already preordained, so there is no need for us to do anything." Both are mistaken. People are responsible for taking the appropriate steps in whatever situation they encounter, to set causes in motion, but not to forget that the outcome is in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hands of Allah. Of course precautions will not determine the outcome of anything, yet they need to be taken carefully and scrupulously as an act of faith.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Prophet Ya'qub (as) was a complete believer, and was fully conscious of this secret. The way that he \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
called upon Allah whenever he spoke and considered the hidden aspect of matters is an indication of his God fearing nature. We are told in one verse that Prophet Ya'qub (as) was a servant possessed of knowledge:

On close examination, the brothers really did believe that their little brother had engaged in theft. Yet as we have already seen, it was a grave error for them to think in such terms. They should have known that a believer would never, ever do such a t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hing, and they should have thought the best of their brother and assumed that there had been some kind of mistake. In fact, Prophet Ya'qub (as) behaved in just the manner one would have expected of a believer. He never admitted the slightest possibility t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
at his son might be a thief, since he knew that he was a believer, one who feared Allah. As well as this, since he knew that the morals of his other sons were far removed from those of religion, he refused to trust them and assumed that their own unscrupu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ous dealings lay at the root of the matter, that it was some trick of theirs. Prophet Ya'qub's submission to the will of Allah here is another example of the upright conduct befitting a believer. Although he believed that what had happened to his son was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 mistake of some sort and that there was a trick involved somewhere, he immediately turned to Allah and patiently sought His help. Again, he made it clear that what befitted him was patience. Prophet Ya'qub (as) never lost hope. He even hoped that Allah w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uld reunite him with Yusuf (as) and his other son in the near future.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, believing that there is something auspicious in every event is one of the most defining characteristics of believers. That there was something auspicious in the other brothers'\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 belief that the youngest had stolen the goblet, is borne out by the fact that they were thereby easily persuaded to leave the youngest brother behind in Egypt without creating any difficulties for Prophet Yusuf (as).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Prophet Ya'qub (as), on the other hand\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, knew this secret, that is, that Allah created everything and made them favourable for believers. In fact, the most striking aspect of his attitude is the way that he does not link the events to material causes, does not think with a superficial logic of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cause and effect, and knows that everything is very definitely under the control of Allah. This example shows that believers must never abandon their hope in Allah, no matter what happens, no matter how difficult the conditions. They must always be full o

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, Prophet Ya'qub (as) was in an interesting position. Despite knowing that Allah created everything, he did not hesitate to feel sorrow as regards Prophet Yusuf (as) and his brother. That was his test. So testing 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
was the experience, in fact, that as revealed in the Qur'an, his eyes turned white from grief over Prophet Yusuf (as), that is to say, he went blind. His sons warned him that he might fall sick because of the sorrow he felt, or even die:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another fact emphasised in this verse is that believers must always be hopeful under all circumstances. Prophet Ya\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
'qub (as) never lost hope that he would see Prophet Yusuf (as) and his brother, and he advised his sons never to abandon hope in Allah. Loss of hope in Allah is a state of mind fit for unbelievers, not the faithful.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Da\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the lo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ry to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 om wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even in the period when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Species}{\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experime\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The conditions required for the formation of a c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 maller than 1 over 1050 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book }{\i\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Mendel and verified by the science of genetics that flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fe

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evoluti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
on in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent "mutations,"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ery complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer). No doubt,

\par }{\f0\insrsid5507536\charrsid146565 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly ans\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
wer the question of "how we see." Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 on. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is completely \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the centre of vision is a completely dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ight world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
image for you. This is a three-dimensional, coloured, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
esigns have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 yes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision lik
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ce. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of peo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 le cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uter ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matt\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

 the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible.
