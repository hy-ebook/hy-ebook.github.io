A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the last 140 years it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t appropriate to devote a chapter to summarise this subject. 
\par 
\par \bullet \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
xplained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hey can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par 
\par \bullet \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and re\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par 
\par \bullet \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

g under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has publish
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

d to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, R
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ssian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisd\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
om and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hese books are characterised by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary mov
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ments of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No mate\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rial gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a wast\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experien
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e. It is impossible for books devised to emphasise the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals en\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tate of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the wil\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Most interestingly, in spite of being surrounded by such a serious threat, we make no effort whatsoever to protect ourselves against it. This is because there is a mechani\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 bodies, for it undertakes one of the most vital missions of life. We may not be aware of it, but all the elements of the immune system protect our bodies just like the soldiers of a huge army. The defence cells that protect the human body against invader

People in general would like to know what makes them ill, how illnesses take complete control of their bodies, what causes fever, fatigue, pain in their bones and joints, and which processes take place in their bodies throughout their illnesses.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The ma\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in purpose of this book is to explore how this system, which protects the human body just like a disciplined, organised army, has come into being and how it works. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These two points will lead us to very important conclusions. First, we shall together witne\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  erected. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before proceeding to the main topic, it will be useful to state another important point: In books on the immune system, you will often see statements such as:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "We do not yet know how this formed\'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "The reason still remains unknown\'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "Research on the topic is under way \'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "According to a theory\'85\loch\f0 "
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These statements are actually important confessions. These are expressions of the helplessness people experience at the outset of the 21st century \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  even with all the latest technology and acc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 umulated knowledge at their disposal \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
 in the face of the miraculous work these tiny cells accomplish. The tasks achieved by these microorganisms include such intricate operations that the human mind can barely grasp the details of this well established s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 stem. There is obviously a secret wisdom hidden in the immune system which eludes man's understanding. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As you read this book, you will witness the superiority of this wisdom, hidden both in your cells and in other details pertaining to your body. The ulti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mate conclusion is that this could only be the wisdom of a supreme "Creator". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Science may one day succeed in solving all the secrets of the immune system and even produce a similar artificial system by imitating the actions of these cells. No doubt, this \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
task will require highly educated professionals using the most sophisticated technology and instruments available, working in highly advanced laboratories. The most important point here is that the accomplishment of such a task would once again invalidate
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the theory of evolution, proving that such a system cannot originate by coincidence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The likelihood of the spontaneous development of a mechanism such as the defence system currently seems too remote. As scientists unravel the secrets of this system, they\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 are enthralled by the design they encounter. The points that are revealed lead to many other questions, which make the wisdom and consciousness in the cell all the more apparent. Therefore, it has become very clear that the defence system, like all the o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 her systems in the body, could not have developed gradually, just by chance, as suggested by the theory of evolution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The main purpose of this book is to introduce you to these "brave warriors" within you, while also proving to you that this mind-boggling\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 system is a special sign of creation. In relation to this, we will see how the scenarios formulated by the theory of evolution are demolished and rendered meaningless when faced with the facts. The topic which will be particularly highlighted here, is no
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the biological details of the defence system, which are easily accessible in any book of biology or medicine, but the miraculous aspect of the system. We have especially avoided the unnecessary use of biological and physiological terms in order to make t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e contents of the book easily understandable to readers of all ages and professions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Lastly, we want to remind you that even now, you are totally indebted to your defence system if you are able to read this book peacefully, without being infected by the m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
icrobes all around you. Had the immune system not existed in your body, you would never have been able to read this book, having left this world even before you learned reading and writing.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before delving into the astounding details of the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 war of defence fought in the innermost recesses of our bodies, we must first have a general look at the defence system and its elements. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, the defence system may be defined as "an extremely disciplined, hard-working and organised army that protect\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s the body from the clutches of external enemies." In this multi-faceted war, the main duty of the elements fighting in the front line is to prevent the enemy cells, such as bacteria or viruses, from entering the body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Although it is not easy for the enem\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y organisms to enter the body, they exert themselves to the utmost to reach their ultimate goal of invading the body. When they successfully do so, after overcoming various obstacles such as the skin, and the respiratory and digestive tracts, they will fi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d tough warriors waiting for them. These tough warriors are produced and trained in specialised centres such as the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. These warriors are "the defence cells" referred to as the macrophages and lymphocytes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
various types of phagocytes, which are called the "the eater cells" will swing into action. Then the macrophages, another specific type of phagocytes, take their turn. They all destroy the enemy by engulfing it. Macrophages also perform other duties such 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s summoning other defence cells to the battleground, and raising the body temperature. The rise in temperature at the onset of a sickness is very important, for the afflicted the person will feel fatigued by it and need to rest, thus reserving the energy 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eeded to fight against the enemies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If these elements of the immune system prove insufficient against the enemies penetrating the body, then lymphocytes, the champions of the system, come into play. Lymphocytes are of two types; B cells and T cells. These
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  are again further divided into sub groups.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The helper T cells are next in reaching the battleground after the macrophages. They may be considered the administrative agents of the system. After the helper T cells identify the enemy, they warn other cells i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n order to initiate a war against it.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thus alerted, the killer T cells come into play to destroy the besieged enemy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The B cells are the armaments factory of the human body. Following their stimulation by the helper T cells, they immediately start to prod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uce a sort of weapon called the "antibody". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After the alarm is over, suppressor T cells stop the activity of all defence cells, and therefore prevent the war from lasting any longer than is necessary. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the mission of the defence army has not yet \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ended. The warrior cells, called the memory cells, store necessary information about the enemy in their memories and keep it for years. This will enable the immune system to mount a quick defence against the same enemy at later meetings with it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
There are many more incredible factors hidden in the details of the defence system, which we have very briefly outlined above. As mentioned before, in this book, these extraordinary events are told in an easy-to-understand way. }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743

n continues even when we are asleep. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This intense activity occurs in periods of time which from our viewpoint are very short. There is a significant difference between the notion of time in our daily lives and the biological time of our body. The span of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
one second that represents a very short time period in our daily life would pass for a very long time for many working systems and organs in our bodies. If all the activities performed by all the organs, tissues and cells of our body in one second were wr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tten down, the result would be so inconceivable as to push the limits of the human mind. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One vital system, which is involved in constant activity, never shirking its duty, is the defence system. This system protects the body from all kinds of invaders day\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 and night and works with great assiduity, just like a fully-equipped army for the host body, which it serves. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each system, organ, or group of cells within the body represents a whole within a perfect labour distribution. Any defect in the system ruins th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e order. And the defence system is indispensable.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Would we be able to survive in the absence of the defence system? Or what sort of life would we have if this system failed to fulfill some of its functions?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is not hard to make a guess. Some examples in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the world of medicine make clear how vital the immune system is. The story of a patient cited in many related sources shows how difficult life would be in case of any defect in the defence system. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This patient was placed immediately after his birth in a s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
terile plastic tent, which nothing was allowed to penetrate. The patient was forbidden to touch any other human being. As he grew up, he was placed in a larger plastic tent. He had to wear a specially designed outfit similar to an astronaut's to get out o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  this tent. What prevented this patient from living a normal life like other people? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Following his birth, the patient's defence system had not developed normally. There was no army in his body to protect him from the enemies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The boy's doctors were well a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ware of what could happen if he entered normal surroundings. He would immediately catch a cold, causing diseases to develop in his throat; he would suffer from one infection after another, despite being given antibiotics and other medical treatments. Befo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e long, medical treatment would lose its effect, resulting in the death of the boy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At best, he would be able to live only for a few months or a few years out of this safe environment. So the boy's entire world was forever bounded by the walls of his plast\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ic tent. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After sometime, the doctors and his family placed the boy in a completely germfree room which had been specially prepared in his house. However, all these efforts were useless. In his early teens, when a bone transplant failed.

 family, doctors, the staff of the hospital where he had earlier stayed, and pharmaceutical companies did their best to keep him alive. Although absolutely everything was tried, and the boy's place of residence was continuously disinfected, his death coul

This end clearly shows that it is impossible for a human being to survive without a defence system to protect him from microbes. This is evidence that the immune system must have existed complete and intact since the advent of the first

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The main protective function of the skin is realised via the dead cell layers constituting the outer section\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of the skin. Each new cell produced by cell division moves from the inner section of the skin towards the surface. While doing this, the liquid element (cytoplasm) of the cell interior transforms into a resistant protein known as keratin. During the proc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ss, the cell dies. The newly formed keratin substance has a very hard structure and is not therefore subject to decomposition by digestive enzymes, which is a sign of its resistance. Thus, invaders such as bacteria and fungi will be unable to find anythin

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, dead outer cells containing keratin are constantly shed from the skin surface. The new cells that come from beneath to replace the discarded ones form an impenetrable barrier in that area. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The organ\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
isms on the skin fulfill another protective function of the skin. A group of harmless microbes live on the skin, which have adapted to its acidic medium. Feeding on the leftovers stuck on the keratin of the skin, these microbes attack all kinds of foreign
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 bodies to protect their feeding site. The skin, as the host of these microbes, is like a supplementary force that provides external support to the army within the human body.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This plan developed by the virus to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The human body can produce a compatible antibody for almost every enemy it encounters. Ant\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ibodies are not of one type only. According to the structure of every enemy, a specific antibody powerful enough to deal with it is produced. This is because an antibody produced for one disease may not be effective on another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Manufacturing a specific an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tibody for each enemy is rather an unusual process, which deserves closer attention. This process can be realised only if the B cells know their enemies and their structures very well. There are, however, millions of enemies (antigens) in nature.

like manufacturing a compatible key for each of millions of locks straight away. What is important is that the manufacturing agent does this without examining the lock or using any mould. It knows the formula by heart.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We have previously stated that antibodies are a type of protein. So, let us first examine the structure of proteins. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Proteins are made up of amino acids. Twenty different types of amino acids are\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 arranged in different sequences to form different proteins. This is similar to making different necklaces by using beads in twenty different colours. The main differences among proteins are due to the sequence of these amino acids.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet there is an importa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nt point to remember: Any error in the amino acid sequence makes the protein useless, and even harmful. Therefore, there is no room for even the smallest error in the sequence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how do the protein factories in the cell know in which sequence to arrange\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the amino acids they contain, and which protein to produce? The instructions for each of the thousands of different types of proteins are encoded in the genes found in the genetic data bank in the cell nucleus. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Therefore, these genes are required for the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  production of the antibodies which are a type of protein. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is a very important miracle here. There are only one hundred thousand genes in the human body compared to the 1,920,000 antibodies that are produced. This means that nine hundred thousand ge\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nes are missing. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Then how is it ever possible that such a small number of genes can produce antibodies about ten times their value? The miracle is revealed at this point. The cell combines the hundred thousand genes it contains in different combinations t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o form new antibodies. It receives the information from some genes and combines it with the information in other genes and makes the required production according to this combined information.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1,920,000 different antibodies are formed as a result of 5,200 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 different combinations.}{\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  This process represents a wisdom and planning that are too great for the human mind to comprehend, let alone design.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{
\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An unlimited number of combinations can be made with the use of one hundred thousand genes. The cell, however, us\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es, with great intelligence, only 5,200 basic combinations and produces 1,920,000 specific antibodies. How has the cell learned to make the right combinations out of these unlimited possibilities to form the required antibodies?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Making the correct combinat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ions out of an infinite number of possibilities aside, how has the cell got this idea of making combinations?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, the produced combinations serve a certain purpose, and aim to produce an antibody that would eliminate the antigen that enters the body.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Therefore, the cell also knows the properties of the millions of antigens entering the body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No intellect in this world can produce a design of such unparalleled perfection. But cells only the size of a hundredth of a millimeter can do so.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how has th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e cell learned such a special system? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The truth is that no cell has the opportunity to "learn" a biological function in the real sense. This is because the cell does not possess the ability to perform such an act a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t birth, nor has it the chance to develop the required skill during the rest of its lifetime. In such cases, it is a prerequisite that the system in the cell should be ready and complete at the beginning of life. The cell neither possesses the skill to le
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rn such combinations, nor does it have the time to learn them, as this would cause it to fail in stopping the antigens entering the body and the body would lose the war. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that a system that baffles mankind, even at the point of comprehending it, h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
as been placed in a cell which has no ability to think and reason, has a very special meaning. This is the reflection of the uniqueness of the creation of Allah, the All-Knowing, in a tiny cell. In the Qur'an, it is stated that Allah's superior wisdom enc

design an antibody molecule, how would you do it? You would first have to carry out comprehensive research before deciding on the shape of the molecule. Surely you could not shape it randomly without an exact knowledge of its duty. Since the antibodies yo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  are going to produce will make contact with antigens, you would have to be very well informed about the structure and specifications of the antigen, too. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Eventually, the antibody you will produce has to have a special and unique shape at one end. Only th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
en can it bind to an antigen. The other end of it has to be similar to other antibodies. This is the only way the antigen destructing mechanism can be activated. As a result, one end has to be standard, while the other has to be different from the others 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 (\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 which come in more than one million different types). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Human beings, however, have been unable to design an antibody, despite all the technology at their disposal. The antibodies produced in the laboratory environment are either derived from antibody sampl

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n" (a type of protein) and designated as "Ig". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most characteristic proteins of the defence system, the immune globulin molecules bind to the antigens to inform other immune cells of the existence of the antigen or to start the destructive chain reacti

\par }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3871332 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 IgG (Immune Globulin G):}{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 IgG is the most common antibody. Its development takes only a few days, while its life span ranges from a few weeks to se\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
veral years. IgGs circulate in the body and are mainly present in the blood, lymphatic system, and intestine. They circulate in the bloodstream, directly target the invader, and latch on to it as soon as they detect it. They have a strong antibacterial an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  antigen-destroying effect. They protect the body against bacteria and viruses, and neutralise the acidic property of toxins (poisons). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Additionally, the IgG may squeeze itself between cells, and eliminate the bacteria and micro-organic invaders that have\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 infiltrated to the cells and the skin. Due their above-mentioned ability and small size, they can enter the placenta of a pregnant woman and protect an undefended foetus against possible infections.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }
{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If antibodies were not created with this characteristic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 which permits them to penetrate the placenta, the unborn child in the mother's womb would be unprotected against microbes. It would be under the threat of death even before it was born. For this reason, the antibodies of the mother protect the embryo aga

 These antibodies are present in sensitive regions where the body fights with antigens such as in tears, saliva, mother's milk, blood, air sacs, mucus, gastric and intestinal secretions. The\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 sensitivity of those regions relates directly to the tendency of bacteria and viruses to prefer such damp mediums. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 IgAs, which are structurally quite similar to each other, settle in those regions of the body where microbes are most likely to enter, and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they keep this area under control. This is like placing reliable soldiers on guard at strategically critical points. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The antibodies, which protect the foetus from various diseases in the mother's womb, do not abandon the newborn following their birth, but\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 continue to guard them. All newborn babies do need ongoing assistance from the mother, because there are no IgAs in the organism of a newborn baby. During this period, the IgAs present in the milk the baby sucks from its mother protect the baby's digesti
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e system from the effect of many microbes. Just like IgGs, this antibody class also disappears after they have fulfilled their term of service, when the baby is a few weeks old. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Have you ever wondered who sends you these antibodies that try to protect you\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 from microbes, when you are in the form of an embryo and unaware of anything? Is it your mother or your father? Or is it that they have taken a common decision and sent you these antibodies together? Certainly, the help in question is out of the control 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f both parents. The mother is not even aware that she has been endowed with such an aid plan. The father is just as unaware of all that is going on. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then why do the cells present in the mother's breast and productive of these antibodies function in such a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 way? Which power has told these cells that the newborn needs antibodies? It is by no means a coincidence that the cells engaging in antibody production for the baby are located in the place where the newborns suckle. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here, there is another very important\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 miracle. Antibodies are protein-structured organisms. Proteins, on the other hand, are digested in the human stomach. Therefore, normally, the baby suckling milk from its mother would digest these antibodies in its stomach, and would become unprotected a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ainst microbes. The stomach of the newborn baby, however, is created in such a way that it does not digest and destroy these antibodies. The production of protein-digesting enzymes is very little at this stage. Therefore, antibodies vital for life are not
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 digested and they protect the newborn baby from its enemies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The miracle does not end here. The antibodies, which are not broken down by the stomach, can, however, be absorbed by the intestine as a whole. The intestinal cells of the newborn are created in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 such a way as to do so. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Unquestionably, it is no coincidence that these miraculous events are arranged in such a sequence. The human body, a meticulously planned example of creation, passes from the embryonic stage to having a fully functional immune sys
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tem in a perfectly phased manner. This is because the events that are supposed to take place in the body every day, every hour and every minute, are computed in an extremely finely-tuned manner. Certainly, the author of this precise calculation is Allah, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 W\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ho creates everything according to a very intricate plan.

 These antibodies are present in the blood, lymph and on the surface of the B cells. When the human organism encounters an antigen, IgM is the first antibody that\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  is produced in the body in response to this enemy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An unborn child can produce IgMs in the sixth month of gestation. If an enemy ever attacks the baby in the mother's womb, for example, if it infects it with a microbial disease, the baby's IgM production

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - Antibodies latch on to antigens (enemies) entering the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - A different type of antibody is produced for every enemy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - The cell is able to produce thousands of different antibodies for thousands of different antigens. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - This production \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 starts as soon as the enemy enters the body and is identified. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - There is full harmony between the antigen and the three dimensional antibody, which is produced for that specific antigen, just as a key exactly fits a lock. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - The cell, when required, arra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nges the information it possesses in a conscious way and produces different antibodies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - While doing all this, it displays wisdom and planning far beyond the boundaries of the human mind's comprehension. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - Certain antibodies, which are specially placed \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in the mother's milk, meet the antibody need of a baby, which is as yet unable to produce these antibodies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 - The baby's stomach does not digest the antibodies, but spares them so that they serve the baby's body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here we see a perfectly working system in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 place. Inside the cells that produce the antibodies, Allah placed information containing the construction plans of these antibodies that would fill thousands of encyclopaedia pages. Furthermore, He has given these unconscious cells the ability to make co
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 binations, such as are beyond the reach of the human mind. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How do people who blindly believe in evolution explain the existence of such a perfect system? The answer is very simple: they cannot. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The only thing they do is put forward illogical assumptions \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
which strongly self-contradict. There are many imaginary scenarios without any scientific validity that are solely directed towards finding an answer to the question of "How can we explain this system in terms of evolution?". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most popular of these sce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 narios maintains that the immune system evolved from a single antibody. Here is the summary of this scenario which has no scientific basis:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Initially the defence system comprised of a single gene that produced a single type of immunoglobulin (a kind of pro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tein). But this gene "rapidly created copies of itself (!)" and developed these copies so that they formed a different molecule of immunoglobulin. Then the control mechanisms developed that monitor the manufacturing of different genes which possess the ab
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lity to re-combine".
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This example is important in seeing how shaky are the grounds the theory of evolution is built on, and in understanding the brainwashing and window-dressing methods evolutionists frequently have recourse to. Now let us examine this dec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eit sentence by sentence: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sentence 1: "Initially the defence system comprised of a single gene that produced a single type of immunoglobulin (a kind of protein)."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The first question that must be asked is: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "By whom was this inaugural gene created?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Evolutionists try to present this stage as an insignificant detail and circumvent it. However, how this initial gene has originated must be explained. It is scientifically impossible for a gene to have formed by itself. The impossibility of the coincident
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l formation of the gene sequence is a fact which has been admitted by evolutionist scientists many times. We can give an example from Prof. Ali Demirsoy, a Turkish evolutionist, on this subject. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 That is, if life requires a certain sequence, it can be said\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that this has a probability likely to be realised once in the whole universe. Otherwise some metaphysical powers beyond our definition must have acted in its formation.}{\i\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 5}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet evolutionists cover up this point and make a senseless presupposition such as "wh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
atever the argument, there surely was a gene at the beginning." As is quite evident, the scenario collapses right at the first step. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sentence 2: "But this gene "rapidly created copies of itself (!)" and developed these copies so that they formed a differe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nt molecule of immunoglobulin."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Though impossible, let us suppose that there was a gene at the beginning. Though it is utterly impossible for this first gene to have formed by itself, evolutionists make statements, lacking any logical basis such as "it cre
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ated copies of itself." Such statements, which have no scientific value, constitute a good example of the window-dressing style of the evolutionists. A hypothesis assuming that a gene created and developed different copies of itself complies neither with 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he rules of logic nor with scientific facts. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, the antibodies produced by such an imaginary gene, which has supposedly formed by itself, and its copies, have to possess such properties and structure as will stop the antigens coming from the extern
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 al world. This means that the same Creator, that is, Allah created both antigens and the genes that are responsible for producing antibodies for antigens. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sentence 3: "Then the control mechanisms developed that manage the manufacturing of different genes \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 which possess the ability to re-combine."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Unable to explain even the working principles of these control and combination mechanisms, evolutionists evade the issue by saying that "this system brought itself into being" whenever it serves their purpose. They
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 do not attempt to describe how such an incredible system developed by itself as a result of coincidences. When they try to bring some explanations of their own to these issues, they cannot put forward anything but fabricated and ridiculous scenarios. By 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oing so, they expose their weakness, and the unreasonableness of the claim they make.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If an enemy overcomes all barriers and succeeds in entering our body, this does not mean that the defence army has been defeated. On the contrary, the real war has just begun, and the main soldiers come into play at this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 stage. The first soldiers to meet the foe are the eater cells, that is, phagocytes, which continuously travel in our body and keep control of what is going on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These are "special cleaning cells", which ingest the unwanted microbes that have penetrated the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 inner surfaces of the body, and alert the defence system when necessary. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Certain cells in the defence system capture, break down, digest, and eliminate the miniscule particles and liquid foreign matter that have entered our body. This event is called "pha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gocytosis" (cell engulfing).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Phagocytosis is one of the most important elements of the immune system. It provides an immediate and effective protection against infections. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Phagocytes, considered the "police forces of the body," can be examined under two s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eparate headings. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. Mobile police forces: These roam in the blood and shuttle forwards and backwards between the tissues when required. These cell units, which circulate throughout the body, also serve as scavengers. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Immobile police forces: These are\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  immobile macrophages, which are situated in the gaps in various tissues. They perform phagocytosis on the micro-organisms from where they are, without moving. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If the invader antigens (foreign micro-organisms) are few enough for the present eater cells to\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 deal with, they are destroyed with no extra alarm being given. But if the invader microbes are too great in number, the eater cells may fail to get them under control. Unable to digest all of them, they expand in size. When distended by the antigens, the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cells burst, causing a liquid substance (pus) to overflow. This does not mean that the war is lost. So far, the eater cells have just met the microbes, which have still many tougher barriers to pass. The formation of pus activates the lymphocytes, which h

When the war becomes intense, the macrophages swing into action. Macrophages operate in a specific manner exclusive to themselves. They do not become involved in a one-to-one combat like the antibodies. Unlike the antibodies, they do not work with a syste

 similar to a bomb aimed at a single target. Just like a gun firing lead shot, or a bomb that can be aimed at many targets together, the macrophages can destroy a great number of enemies together, all at the same time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Like all other defence cells, the ma\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
crophages are also derived from the bone marrow. The macrophages, which have a very long life span, can live for months, and even years. Despite their small size (10-15 micrometers), they are highly crucial for human life. They possess the ability to abso

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Their characteristic of ingestion makes them the scavengers of the defence system. They remove all materials that need to be cleaned up, such as micro-organisms, antigen-antibody com\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
plexes, and other substances similar in structure to an antigen. At the end of these processes, substances that would be qualified as antigens are digested, and thus pose no further threat to the organism.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After traveling a long way, "pyrogen" reaches the brain where it stimulates the fever-increasing centre of the brain. Once alerted, the brain sets off alarms in the body and the p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The human body can defeat many of its enemies by using antibodies. This may lead you to wonder why lymphocytes intervene in the war directly when they already make a considerable contribution by producing antibodies. However, some microbes are 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 so deadly that very strong chemical toxins are needed for their removal. Therefore, some lymphocytes use these chemical toxins and directly participate in the war. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How then would the defence system stop these enemies?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, chemists and a laboratory woul\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d be needed to produce the toxin. The structure of the required material is too special to be formed by coincidence. Allah, Who knows that the human body will face such an enemy, or rather, Who created such an enemy for man to take warning, has also given
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the lymphocytes to synthesize this toxin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, is this chemical material satisfactory? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No, because this substance cannot freely circulate in the blood, as this would mean the death of our own cells as well. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How then will this toxin be used without causing any harm to our cells?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The answer to this question is hidden in the perfection of the creation of the lymphocytes. Toxins are placed in sacs located in the cell membrane of the lymphocytes. This helps the ch\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emical weapon to be used easily. The lymphocyte injects this toxin only when it contacts the enemy cell, eventually killing it.

In that case, the other cells send a signal inside the B cell. This signal is actually an order for the cell to "commit suicide". Eventually, some enzymes in the nucleus of the cell are activated and they decompose the DNA of the cell. A perfectly workin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g auto-control mechanism protects the body, and finally, only the B cells that produce antibodies that cause harm to the enemy can stay alive. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Only comprised of a compact nucleus and very little cytoplasm initially, the B cells undergo unbelievable change\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s when they meet an antigen. They divide repeatedly and build up thousands of assembly points in their cytoplasm for the manufacture of antibodies, as well as an extensive channeling system for the packaging and exporting the antibodies. One B cell can pu

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Memory cells are cells specially created to protect man's health. Allah equipped them with strong memorizing ability by design. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the cell to develop a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 strategy on its own accord and give itself within this strategy the responsibility for storing information. Moreover, the cell is even unaware of such a need; much less does it feel the need to employ such a strategy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, there is another importa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nt question that needs to be answered about the strong memories of the memory cells. In a normal human being, eight million cells die every second to be replaced by new ones. Therefore, the metabolism continuously renews itself. Yet the life span of memor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cells is much longer than the life span of other cells. This characteristic helps them to protect people from diseases thanks to the information in their memories. These cells, however, are not everlasting. Though a long time later, they eventually die. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t this point, we are left with a very surprising situation. Memory cells transfer the information they possess to the next generation before they die. People are indebted to these memory cells for not having to be afflicted all over again by the same in d

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How then can this cell know that it has to transfer this information?

 definitely needs further consideration. It knows that the T cells defend the human body,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  identify the enemy and present the enemy it captures to the T cells for them to provide intelligence about it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Why would the cell do this? According to the theory of evolution, this cell should be concerned only about its own well-being. However, it serv\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es the system, although it receives no benefit from it. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What is even more interesting is that the APC are very well aware of the requirements of the T cells. Based on this, the APC will break down the enemy cell and present to the T cell only the amino ac\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Until now, we have discussed the general structure of the defence system, its organs, cel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ls, and enemies. In this chapter, we will explore the deadly warfare between our defence system and enemy cells, and the wonderful defence our body mounts. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brave battle fought by of our defence system is comprised of three important stages: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. Identi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fication of the enemy, first action. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. The attack of the real army, all-out war. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. Retreat to a normal state. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The defence system has to clearly identify the enemy before it starts the fight. This is because each engagement differs from the other depen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ding on the type of enemy. Moreover, if this piece of intelligence is not properly handed on, our defence system may inadvertently attack the body's own cells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The phagocytes, known as the scavenger cells of the defence system, take the first action. They\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fight hand-to-hand with the enemy. They are just like infantrymen who fight with bayonets against enemy units. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sometimes, phagocytes cannot catch up with the increasing numbers of the enemy, at which point big phagocytic cells, macrophages cut in. We can\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 liken the macrophage to cavalrymen cleaving their way through the middle of the foe. At the same time, macrophages secrete a fluid, which sets off a general alarm in the body to increase the body temperature. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Macrophages have yet another important charac\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
teristic. When a macrophage cell captures and engulfs a virus, it tears off a special portion of the virus, which it carries on itself like a flag. This serves as a sign for the other elements of the defence system as well as an item of information. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the gathered intelligence is forwarded to the helper T cells, by the help of which they identify the enemy, their first task is to immediately alert the killer T cells, stimulating them to multiply. Within a short period, the stimulated killer T cells wil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 become a formidable army. This is not the only function of the helper T cells. They also ensure that more phagocytes arrive at the battlefront while they transfer the gathered intelligence relating to the enemy to the spleen and lymph nodes.}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once the lym\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ph nodes receive this information, the B cells, which have been waiting for their turn, are activated. (The B cells are manufactured in the bone marrow and then migrate to the lymph nodes to wait for their turn to be of service). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The activated B cells go \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
through a number of stages. Every stimulated B cell begins to multiply. The multiplication process continues until thousands of identical cells are formed. Then, the B cells, which are ready for war, start to divide and are transformed into plasma cells. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 P\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lasma cells also secrete antibodies, which will be used as weapons during the fight with the enemy. As stated in earlier chapters, B cells are capable of producing thousands of antibodies in a second. These weapons are very handy. They are capable enough 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o bind to the enemy first, and then to destroy the biological structure of the enemy (antigen). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If the virus penetrates the cell, the antibodies cannot capture the virus. At this point, the killer T cells come into play again and, by identifying the virus\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es in the cell with the help of MHC molecules, they kill the cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, if the virus has been successfully camouflaged, escaping even the notice of killer T cells, then "natural killer cells", briefly called NKs, swing into action. These cells destroy\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the cells which host viruses in them, and which are imperceptible to other cells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After the victory is won, suppressor T cells stop the war. Although the war is over, it is never to be forgotten. Memory cells have stored the enemy in their memory. Stayin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g in the body for years, these cells help the defence to be faster and more effective if the same enemy is encountered again. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The heroes of this war have not received any military training. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The heroes of this war are not human beings able to reason. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  heroes of this war are cells so minuscule as to hardly cover a full stop when they come together in millions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, this amazing army does not engage in fighting alone. It manufactures all the weapons it will use during the war; it makes all war plan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s and strategies itself, and cleans up the battleground after the war. If all these processes were left in the control of man, and not cells, would we ever be able to handle such a feat of organization?

People do not immediately realise that microbes or viruses are invading their bodies. Only when the symptoms of their illness surface do humans become aware of them. This is proof that a virus, a bacterium, or a similar mic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ro-organism has long ago settled within their body. This means that the primary intervention has resulted in failure. Such unchecked conditions could cause the disease to progress considerably, resulting in irremediable dispositions. Even if the person ha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  been infected with a curable and relatively simple disease, delayed response may result in a serious crisis, or even death. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let us imagine that the coordination and control of the elements of the defence system and the ensuing strategies to be devel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oped and implemented, the overseeing of the war itself were all left to human beings. What sort of difficulties would we confront?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us assume that the initial symptoms were effectively diagnosed. When foreign cells enter the human body, immediately the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
warrior cells must be manufactured and then sent to the area of conflict. The B cells must immediately commence the production of the weapon (antibody). How are we to determine the type and location of these foreign cells? This is a significant point, as 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uture treatment depends on this initial stage. To do this, the only solution for the person would be to have a medical check-up which covered all the organs of his body down to every drop of his blood at the slightest suspicion of invaders having entered 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he body. Otherwise, it would be impossible to determine the type and location of the antigens. The long time needed for such a process would undoubtedly cause a serious delay in timely intervention. It is evident how troublesome and distressful life would
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 be for people if they had to go to the doctor's to undergo such a check-up on the merest hint of infection. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us suppose that timely intervention was possible and the type and location of antigens could be identified precisely. Depending on the type of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the enemy, first the phagocytes have to be activated. How can phagocytes be directed to rush to the exact location? What kind of a message would help them to locate the enemy easily? Let us suppose that the impossible became the possible. Then comes the t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
me to learn whether the phagocytes have won the war or not. Depending on the result, either the macrophages will be launched or the war will be stopped. No doubt, the only possible solution lies with visiting the doctor again and having a thorough check-u
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. If the war has not been won, the secondary forces, that is, the macrophages, must be sent to the area of conflict. Meanwhile, the time spent on the check-up would work against us. Without losing any time, the macrophages have to tear a piece off the ene
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y and warn the helper T cells. The helper T cells will in turn warn the killer T cells, thus initiating another struggle. These cells, too, must be checked on as to whether they are successful or not \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

 the NK cells must be called in for assistance. After a final examination, it will be determined if the defence system has been effective in defeating the infection. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If man were asked to control only his defence system and nothing else, he would have to b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 E\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ven the slightest delay or a problem in the course of the process would cause the illness to be further aggravated.

We have explored in previous chapters how the defence system distinguishes between friendly and hostile cells with the help of the receptors. However, the building blocks of some hostile\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cells are almost identical to those of certain tissues in the human body. This represents a significant problem for the defence system, which might conceivably attack some of its own tissues accidentally. }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Under normal conditions, though, such a response \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
never happens in a healthy human body. The defence system never attacks a molecule, cell, or tissue of its own. In medical terms this phenomenon is referred to as "tolerance".
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This constitutes an extremely important miracle. We can clearly see that the def\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ence system is fully capable of differentiating between thousands of proteins. For example, the defence system must distinguish the haemoglobin found in blood from the insulin secreted by the pancreas and from the vitreous humour contained in the eye, and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 indeed, from everything else in the human system. The defence system knows that while it fights a merciless war against foreign molecules, it must not harm any tissues belonging to the human body.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, researchers have tried to understand how th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e defence system has learned to be tolerant towards its own tissues. Yet, details concerning why the most important lymphocytes, namely, the T and B cells, do not attack the human body have only been revealed in the last 20 years. The tolerance process, o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ly a small portion of which mankind has been able to discover as the result of years long research, has been in operation since the human being came into existence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How then has the defence system possessed the ability to distinguish the various different\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 structures from each other? Can this be the result of unconscious coincidences as the theory of evolution suggests? It is certainly impossible for structures made up of unconscious atoms to coincidentally acquire this selection ability that requires such
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 consciousness, information and intelligence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When specially designed structures of lymphocytes enabling them to make the right choise is investigated, it will be understood how illogical and unreasonable the claim of evolutionists is. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A defence cell developed within the bone marrow or the thymus would be killed or inactivated if it reacted to the products of the body. A mature lymphocyte faces the same consequence in case it attacks the body's own products. That is to say that any elem
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nt of the defence system likely to harm the body is either killed or forced to commit suicide obeying the command it receives. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, if a T cell is confronted by another body cell, it does not attack but rather inactivates itself. Similarly, if there i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s any substance in the body that carries antigen properties which should not, however, be destroyed, the human body does not produce any antibodies and so does not attack it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If we consider the fact that our body contains around 1 trillion lymphocytes, we \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

In essence, the embryo in a mother's womb should normally be considered foreign matter by the host human body. Subsequently, when the embryo is first formed, the body would immediately instigate a struggle against it. The defence system would not allow su
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h an \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 
enemy' to develop. However, despite this negative scenario, the embryo is not as vulnerable as we might assume. After it is formed, it succeeds in fully developing over an extended period of 9 months, completely protected against the intended attack
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of the antibodies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How then is this achieved?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is a barrier surrounding the embryo specially created to absorb only the nutrients in the blood. This barrier helps the embryo to take up the necessary nutrients for its development, while isolating it 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 from the destructive effect of antibodies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Otherwise, the antibodies would immediately attack the embryo (considered as a foreign substance) and destroy it. The isolation of the embryo from the antibodies with such a special protection is one of the most p

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Neither mutation, nor natural selection nor any other so-called evolutionary mechanism could have incorporated such perfect creation in the evolution tale. The miracle of creation is self-evident. In the Qu

In most general terms, cancer can be characterised as uncontrolled cell replication. Regardless of its type, cancer initially develops in a normal, healthy cell and shares the basic characteristics of this normal ce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ll, at least in its early developmental stages. However, these cells tend to lose some of their abilities. One such important ability is that of reacting to the messages delivered by their surrounding or their own organisms that regulate cell replication.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
When such a disorder occurs, the cell can no longer control its replication and the growth of tissues. This process, known as "continuous dividing," is genetically transferred to new cells resulting in the spread of tumours, which in turn invade the neigh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ouring tissues. These decomposed cells eat up the nutrients of other cells, consuming the vital amino acid supply. Cancer cells eventually shut down the passages within the human body with their expanding volume. They accumulate in various organs such as 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys, surrounding the healthy and normal cells of these organs and preventing their normal functioning, eventually posing a serious threat to human life.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Normal cells replicate only when they receive a command from neighbouri\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng cells. This is a safety measure within the organism. However, cancer cells do not respond to this mechanism and refuse any control over their replication system. The type of cancer described so far does not create any problem for the defence system. A 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
trong body with an effective defence system is capable of struggling with the increasingly expanding cancerous cells multiplying in number, and of even defeating the disease. The main problem arises when cancer cells pierce their own membranes with the he
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p of an enzyme (pac-man enzyme), and mix in the circulatory system (the conveyor network) of the body by penetrating the lymphatic fluid, and eventually reaching distant tissues and cells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The current scenario is quite negative. Cells that used to work co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
llectively in providing humans with the gifts of seeing, hearing, breathing, and living suddenly grow recalcitrant, not obeying the "stop" command they receive from neighbouring cells. As they continue replicating, they carry out a destruction process at 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ull blast which leads to the total death of the body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If we compare the human body to a country and the human defence system to a powerful, fully equipped army, the cancer cells emerge as the rebels of this country. This mutinous community grows in number
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  daily, continuing their demolition of the current structure. But the army of this country is not at all pregnable. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The macrophages, the front line warriors of the defence system, surround the invader when they encounter it and destroy the cancer cells wi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
th the help of a protein they specially produce. In addition, the T cells, the strong and intelligent warriors of the defence system and their exceptional weapons (antibodies) kill the cancer cells that have begun to fuse in the body and lymphatic fluids 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y piercing the cell membrane. The struggle will continue even as the cancer spreads. As the cancer cells develop further, the defence cells help to inhibit the progress of the disease, resulting in remission.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the systems within human cells which pre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
vent the spread of cancer cells is "apoptosis", which causes the suicide of the cell. Apoptosis is seen when the DNA of the cell is damaged, or a tumour develops, or the effectiveness of the P53 gene \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
 also known as the "cancer preventing gene" \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  lessens.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Though apoptosis may appear to be a very negative event, it is actually highly important, as it blocks such vital disorders and prevents the disease from passing on to the next generation. When compared to the potential danger imposed by the cancer cells,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
which are likely to damage the entire human body, the loss of a single cell is much more acceptable. Cells within the human body that realise (!) that there is a disorder in their own structure threatening the human body instigate their own demise to prol
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng human life.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The cancer takes on a life-threatening form when these decomposed cells overcome this suicide system. In this case, a second defence mechanism is activated to avoid uncontrolled multiplying of these cells. If they succeed in surpassing this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
barrier, too, they then encounter a further stage known as the "the term of crisis". At this stage, the cells, which have successfully escaped from the previous security systems, are killed en masse. Among these cells, one cell, however, succeeds in overc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ming the "crisis". This "rebellious" cancer cell will transfer its rebellious nature to its descendants, which will multiply in great numbers. The cancerous patient must now fight an intensive struggle with cancer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Is it only the uncontrolled, independent \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 and continuously multiplying nature of the cancer cell that brings victory to it? Other reasons lie behind this success. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Cells carry a type of inscription system on their surface which positions them in the body. This inscription system is decipherable by\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 all the cells within the human body, helping each cell to know exactly where it belongs and preventing it from occupying another's place. This system ensures the integrity of the tissues. Cells, which are aware of their position, neither go anywhere else
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nor let any other cell occupy their place, thus ensuring the maintenance of the body in a healthy state. Cells that are not located at a certain site or those located at an inappropriate site will eventually commit suicide. However, with the help of this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
system, the suicide process is totally eliminated, as the cells are not allowed to be dislocated or located in an inappropriate site. This process is not as simple as it may seem. In order to maintain the effective functioning of this system, each cell ha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to identify its own position whilst respecting the locations of other cells, and being mindful not to invade their sites. These procedures are taught to them by various mediator molecules which enable these cells to maintain their respective places. Howe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er, there are occasions when these mediator molecules are absent or unable to fulfil this duty. This provides the cancer cells with an advantage. When inhibitory molecules are not present in the environment, cancer cells spread more rapidly. Besides, canc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r cells are not required to anchor themselves to any specific site. They undermine the rules by living independently and without settling in any place.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Erythrocytes are exceptional cells that do not possess a stationary site within the human body. They pie\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rce the membranes of other cells and tissues and tear down the obstacles with the aid of a special enzyme called "metallo-proteinase". They are therefore able to visit any part of the human body at will. The defence cells use this enzyme to reach out to t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e enemy cells, while cancer cells use them for an entirely different purpose. Their main goal is to attack healthy cells and invade them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The skills of the cancer cells are not limited to these pursuits; they are also capable of playing other \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 games' again\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
st the defence cells. Odd as it may sound, we are not talking about talented actors but rather cancer cells, which play games against their opponents. Before attempting to explain these unbelievably clever games, let us review what we have explained so fa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Isn't it extraordinary that our army of defence sets up progressive barriers against the enemy? This organization we call an "army" is made up of cells which can only be viewed under an advanced electron microscope. Their ability to protect and guard th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eir sites, their willingness to lay down their own lives to save the life of the human body they belong to, their unyielding commitment to continue their struggle, are not the products of coincidence. Undoubtedly, we can see a very conscious and well-orga
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ised form of functioning in defence cells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What would happen if such a difficult mission were handed to a trillion highly educated humans beings? Would the success rate be as impressive? Would it be possible for them to enforce their will on the crowd des
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pite the existence of strict disciplinary rules and obligatory measures? If a few of these individuals forgot the formula of the antibodies they were supposed to manufacture, or neglected to manufacture them, or refused to commit suicide when necessary, w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uld all of these stages function regularly? Would the struggle end with victory? Could an army of billions of individuals continue its struggle without any mistake? Are there, by any chance, any brave and skilled commanders or managers who would be willin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to undertake the responsibility of keeping these billions under control? However, our defence cells do not need any commanders or managers. Their system operates in a very regulated manner, without any inhibitions or difficulties. There is no anarchy or 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
onfusion during the process. The reason for this perfection and extremely effective functioning is Allah, Who established this system down to its minute details and inspired the elements of this system to fulfill their responsibilities. In the 5th verse o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Surat al-Sajda, it is stated: "He directs the whole affair from heaven to earth". In accordance with this rule, the defence cells continue their struggle without rest or duress with this inspiration Allah has given to them.

It must not be forgotten that cancer cells are original body cells that carry the molecular character of the human being. In consequence, it is difficult for the defence cells to identify cancer cells. Furthermore, cancer cells manage to win over some ant
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 bodies by a method undiscovered to date. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we have mentioned, antibodies are a type of protein that stops the activities of enemy cells. However, for some unknown reason, cancer cells are adversely affected by the antibodies. Instead of stopping, their a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ctivities increase, resulting in the rapid and forceful spreading of the tumour.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Antibodies, which bind themselves on to the surface of the cancer cell, "collaborate" with the cancer cell in a sense. Other antibodies do not touch a cancer cell having an an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tibody attached to it. Hence, the cancer cell is perfectly camouflaged. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Collaboration between antibodies and cancer cells can reach even broader dimensions. There are also occasions where cancer cells combine with antibodies to form "pseudo supressor T ce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lls". These pseudo suppressor T cells misinform antibodies by relaying the message that there is "no danger". More sinister situations also develop whereby the cancer cells develop into "Pseudo Helper T cells" instead of the pseudo suppressor T cells. In 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uch situations, the message is delivered to a bigger number of antibodies. There can be no more convenient environment possible for the development of cancer cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Additionally, cancer cells may sometimes spread "trap antigens" in order to protect themsel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ves from a possible attack by the defence system. These tumours spread out such large amounts of antigens from their surface that the blood stream is inundated with them. These antigens, however, are fake and cause no harm to the human body. However, the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ntibodies are not aware of this and they respond without delay by instigating a war against them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During this chaos, the real and dangerous cancer cells continue to function, going undisturbed and undiscovered by the enemy.

One of the most important facts known about the HIV virus is that it enters only some and not all the cells of human beings. Its main target is the helper T cells, which are the most effective elements of the defence system. This is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a very important point. Among numerous types of cells, the virus chooses those cells of the defence system which are, in effect, the most beneficial for it and this instigates the destruction of the human body.}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When T cells, the vital elements of the defe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, the antibodies produced by the human body do not harm the AIDS virus. AIDS patients continue to produce antibodies, however, they are not as effective in the absence of the killer T cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One unanswered qu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
estions is: How does the HIV virus know exactly what target to focus on? By the time the AIDS virus understands that the T cells are regarded as the "brains" of the defence system, it will be destroyed by the existing system immediately upon entering the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uman body. However, it is impossible for the AIDS virus to conduct any form of intelligence surveillance prior to entering the human body. How then has the AIDS virus developed this strategy? 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is only the first of many amazing skills mastered by the A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 IDS virus. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
At the second stage, the virus has to attach itself to the cells which it has set as a target for itself. This procedure is not at all difficult for the AIDS virus. In fact, it attaches to these cells as a key fits into its lock. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At the third \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 stage, the HIV virus undergoes a series of miraculous processes, which will ensure its longevity. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The HIV virus is a retrovirus. This means that its genetic make-up contains solely RNA and no DNA. But a retrovirus needs DNA to remain alive. To provide thi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, it has recourse to a very interesting method: it uses the nucleic acids of its host cell and converts its RNA into DNA by means of an enzyme called "the reverse transcriptase", meaning it will reverse the process. Then it places this DNA in the DNA fou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d in the nucleus of its host cell. The inheritance material of the virus has now become the inheritance material of the T cell. As the cell multiplies, so does the HIV virus. The cell starts to work as a factory for the virus. But invading a single cell d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es not satisfy the HIV virus. It will eventually attempt to seize the whole body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then the fourth stage comes. The initial HIV virus and others want to leave their host cells and invade other cells to facilitate their extraordinary proliferation. They do n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ot expend much effort in doing so. Everything takes place at a natural pace. The membrane of the invaded T cells cannot tolerate the pressure of the multiplication process, and is riddled with holes, allowing the HIV viruses to get out of the cell to seek
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 alternative hosts. As the HIV virus increases in number, it also kills its host T cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The successful HIV virus has now completely seized the human body. Unless mankind succeeds in discovering an effective cure to beat this virus, it will remain there. I\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t is entirely at the discretion of the HIV virus either to lie dormant for many years, or instigate an immediate attack on the human body.

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialised proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

ould these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to na
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a rand
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\i\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 27}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.)
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolution
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ry mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "evolution" could have taken place.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 swered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the dar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 kest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreove
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-}{

ion. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid5072743\charrsid3934205 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nsulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silen
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with image\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ry, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest compan
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are ext
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uch scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people, i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is quite justifiable to speak of this theory as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
m as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m) worshipping idols they had made with their own hands, or the people of the Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) worshipping the Golden Calf.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact, Allah has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur'an. In many verse, He reveals in many verses that some \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
peoples' minds will be closed and that they will be powerless to see the truth. Some of these verses are as follows:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact, the Qur'an relates the incident of Prophet Musa and Pharaoh to show that some people who support atheistic p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hilosophies actually influence others by magic. When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told Prophet Musa to meet with his own magicians. When Musa did so, he told them to demonstrate their abilities first. The verses continue:

\par }{\b\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid5072743\charrsid1132360 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He said: "You thr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we have seen, Pharaoh's magicians were able to deceive everyone, apart from Mus\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

As we can see, when people realised that a spell had been cast upon them and that what they saw was just an illusion, Pharaoh's magicians lost all credibility. In the present\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The author, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. His main focus has been the refutation of Darwinism and materialism, two modern myths pr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sented under a scientific guise. Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the readers\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 perspective by encouraging them to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hink about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of Allah and His unity, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems.
