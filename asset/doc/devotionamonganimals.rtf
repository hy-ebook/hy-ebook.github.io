A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and therefore, Allah's Existence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless sy
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 stems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spa

g deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that is easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other pe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
verted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invalua\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ble service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily se
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ntinuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can find the answer to this question by investigating nature itself. Certainly all living things must seek out food and safety; and every creature must hunt for nourishment and become aggressive in its own de
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fense. However, this is not the only principle at work. The great majority of creatures display selfless acts unequalled of devotion for their offspring and families, for other animals in the herd or in some cases, even for other species. The animal kingd
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m often displays behaviors that reflect devotion and cooperation, solidarity and guarding one another's interests.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution, claiming that nature is only an arena for warfare, can in no way explain these examples of devotion. Living things d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

silverside fish should risk death by coming ashore so as to help ensure the survival of their eggs. According to the claims made by evolutionists, natural selection should have eliminated this kind of altruistic behavior long ago. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Along with invalidating \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the theory of evolution, devotion and cooperation in animals provide evidence of an important truth: that the whole universe has been created by a superior being; and that each and every creature acts on the inspiration of God, its Creator.

Beavers calculate like real engineers, work like master builders, and build lodges of extraordinary design. With the same impressive skill, they build dams to slow the outflow of the water in which\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 they build their dwellings. To accomplish this, they have to undergo some highly tedious procedures. First of all, they must obtain a large quantity of logs and branches, as sources of nourishment as well as for building material for the dam and nest. To

Beavers construct the outside walls of their nests by piling up the building materials they gather, filling every crevice with twigs and mud, making sure not to leave any holes or cavities. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These build\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ing materials they use protect the lodge from sliding and keep out the cold. In winter, it becomes blanketed in snow, and even if the temperature outside falls below -35\'b0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Beavers also build a network of canals, each of them approximately one meter (three feet) wide, by which they can reach the trees they feed off, which are typically located on higher and dri\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Beavers build their dams of plant matter and stones, in a manner similar to their nests. First they weave branches across the water between the two banks of a stream, forming an interwoven triangular structure. In ord

avers are not the only creatures in nature that plan, calculate, and display rational behavior. One of the other successful creatures in this respect is a species of caterpillar, much smaller tha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n a beaver, in which one would never expect to find the slightest glimmer of intellect. This is the atlas moth caterpillar.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This caterpillar pupates in a cocoon like all other moth caterpillars, concealing itself under a leaf once it has emerged from the l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
arval stage. It does this according to a clever premeditated plan whose every stage requires great skill. Since a fresh green leaf cannot be bent to form a protective shelter, the caterpillar overcomes this problem by the simplest imaginable solution. To 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erve its purpose, it first ties the leaf to the branch with its silk, so that the leaf won't fall when the caterpillar gnaws through its stem. Inevitably, the cut leaf dries out and, after a while, begins to curl. In this way, the caterpillar obtains an i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eal leaf tube in the space of a few hours. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the first instance, you might think that by hiding in a dry leaf to obtain a safe abode for itself, the caterpillar displayed intelligent behavior. This might well be true. But also, it would present an easy m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eal. A dry leaf's difference in color would give it away, attracting the attention of birds and spelling doom for the caterpillar.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here again, the caterpillar acts to prevent itself from being recognized easily. Like a mathematician who makes probability c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
alculations, it prepares five or six other "decoy" leaves just like the one it will enter, and weaves silk around them. In this way, any hungry bird must choose among six or seven dry leaves, only one of which contains the caterpillar's pupa. The others a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e all dummies. If a bird turns its attention towards any one of the dry leaves, the odds are six to one against its finding the caterpillar.}{\f0\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It's self-evident that these behaviors are all intelligent and premeditated. But is it really possible for a cate\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rpillar with such a microscopic brain and simple nervous system to display such behavior? The caterpillar does not have the faculty of thought to let it plan ahead. Nor can it possibly have learned this stratagem from another caterpillar and, in reality, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t's not even aware of the dangers that birds might present. So who came up with this idea of how to mislead the caterpillar's predators?

 who programmed them in the first place? No program is self-generating or self-fulfilling, and every program must have a programmer who originated it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists can find no answers to this question. In their publications on the subject, they use a conv\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
? Which part of nature has the intellect or ability to program living creatures? Everything we see in nature has been created and therefore, cannot create on its own. What intelligent person, on seeing a painting, would say, "What a nice picture these pig

Furthermore, it can't be said that they learned their extraordinary behaviors. All these creatures begin to display these behaviors perfectly, from the first moment they emerged from their pupae. They do not go through any learning process on any subject;

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Mammals, which evolutionists claim to have evolved from reptiles, reproduce altogeth\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each animal hunts for food in a different way. Some\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 lurk in ambush over an extended period, others camouflage themselves, and yet others use the advantages of speed or flight. As we know, land animals' behavior varies considerably from that of water dwellers, all depending on their environment and living

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Under these circumstances, animals' instincts must undergo great changes during the evolutionary process. For instance if a fish, following its instincts, sticks its eggs onto a rock and stirs up the water to provide an oxygen flow to them, this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 inner drive must also change, in the process of its evolving into a land animal. Furthermore, this instinct must change further, to the extent where the species starts building perfect nest structures high above the ground to incubate its eggs.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Yet another difficulty presents itself: If a species' biological makeup and therefore, its living environment change, but its behavior does not, then it cannot survive. For instance, a fish able to conceal itself in the oceans must qui
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ckly develop new defense mechanisms for itself, wasting no time. All of its bodily functions, behavior, and way of life must change at once. Otherwise, it is doomed, and its species will quickly die out along with it.

 number of beavers becomes unsustainable, the younger ones migrate north, and the older ones south.19 As these facts demonstrate, no merciless struggle for food or shelter is going on. To the contrary, it can be observed that even in the hardest of times,

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some evolutionists, refusing to admit de\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
feat, came up with a proposition they termed "selfish gene theory." Richard Dawkins, one of the most ardent adherents and the pioneer of this position, claims that what appears to be selfless devotion is really driven by egotism. According to his view, an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mals displaying devotional behavior are doing so not because they want to help others of their species, but are acting on behalf of their own genes. To put this idea in context, any animal mother who sacrifices her life for her young is thereby helping pa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s along her genes. If her offspring survive, they will be more likely to perpetuate her genetic characteristics to the next generation. According to this rationale, all creatures\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 humans included\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are simply "gene machines." Every living organism's foremost\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 responsibility is to pass its genes along for future generations.

Some animals remain with other family members for a very long time, or even for life. Penguins and swans, for instance, are birds that mate for life. Female elephants stay together with their mothers and even their grandmothers.25 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In mammals, usually the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 in wide open spaces where animals live side by side in large colonies, they can recognize their own offspring, mates, parents, and siblings.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each species has a different method of recognizing its own. Ground-nesting birds recognize their young's voices as\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 well as their looks. One example of this are Herring gulls, which raise their young in huge colonies. Even when their chicks are out of sight, parents recognize and respond to their calls without ever confusing their calls with other young gulls'. If a s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ray young bird trespasses their nesting spot, they recognize and chase away the intruder.26 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Usually mammals recognize their own young by their smell and taste. As soon as a baby is born, the mother sniffs and licks it and from then on, never confuses it w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ith any other.27 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Among the most successful creatures in this respect are penguins. They look so alike that when humans observe them carefully, it's almost impossible to tell them apart. Thus it is so astonishing that the members of a penguin family can re
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cognize one another with no difficulty. Consider that the mother leaves her mate and young for a period of two to three months in order to search for food. Yet on her return, she recognizes them both. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Among the hundreds of other penguins, the mother pengu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in easily finds her own mate and their chick. More interestingly, before the adult females set off to go hunting in the sea, they gather all the young to form a nursery as a precaution against the freezing cold. The young birds stay closely packed togethe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, taking advantage of one another's body heat. But there is one problem: How are the adult birds going to recognize their own young on their return from their hunting trip from among the hundreds of other birds. This though does not seem to pose a problem
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
for penguins. Each adult begins to call at high pitch and the young birds recognize their parents by their sound and move towards them.28 No doubt, recognition by voice is under these circumstances the most appropriate method for the thousands of penguins
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 But, how come penguins have the very same appearance but distinct voices so they can recognize one another? Furthermore, how did they acquire the skill to distinguish each other by voice? No penguin could have come up with the idea of such qualities and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 kills and then adopt them by themselves. These must be given qualities, but by whom? According to evolutionists, it is nature\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

y neither, because "nature," to which evolutionists ascribe this and many other powers consists of rocks, stones, trees, ice and the like, which are a totality of created matter. Therefore, the answer to the above question is simple: God creates everythin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  perfect within itself, gives each penguin a distinct voice note and the ability to recognize by voice, thereby making their lives easier for them.

young. Many species use a wealth of astonishing techniques to construct nest with a variety of diverse architectural details. Animals plan often like architects, working like master builders, finding technical solutions like engineers, and sometimes adorn
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng their nests like decorators. Often they work tirelessly, day and night, in constructing their nest. Their mates often share the workload, and the two assist each another. The nests most carefully prepared are those built for the expected arrival of the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 young.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The various techniques used to build these nests are so perfect that one would not expect them from animals devoid of intellect and technological skills. As the following pages will show in great detail, they could not have been designed by the anim
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
als themselves, because they would have to plan out the many stages of the project before even beginning to build. First off, they'd have to realize the need for a nest for the safety of their eggs and young. Next, they'd need to locate the most suitable 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lace for their nests, since no creature builds its nest just anywhere.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Building materials used in the nest's construction are carefully selected from those available in the enviro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nment. For example, water birds build nests from plant matter that will float, in case of unexpected flooding. Birds living among reeds, on the other hand, make their nests wide and deep, to prevent their eggs from falling out when the reeds bend in the w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd. Birds inhabiting deserts build their nests atop of shrubs and cacti, where the temperature is 10o C (50o F) lower than on ground level, where the oven-like 45o C (113o F) heat would kill the young birds in a very short time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Choosing the right locatio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n for a nest requires knowledge as well as intelligence. An animal cannot foresee the risks of flooding, or the danger that high temperatures pose for young birds\hich\f0 
\emdash \loch\f0 much less how to prevent their adverse effects. We are faced, then, with a paradox: On the o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e hand, animals of little intelligence and no knowledge and, on the other, behavior that is conscious, intelligent and knowledgeable. God is the owner of consciousness, intelligence, and knowledge; and expresses these qualities in His perfect creations.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e healthy survival of their offspring is vitally important for all living species; and from the moment of laying their eggs or giving birth to their young, protecting them becomes the parents' sole occupation. The penduline tit, paying utmost attention to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the safety of its offspring, builds a number of dummy nests in the vicinity of its real nest, to divert the attention of any hungry enemy. This diversion strategy, obviously the result of careful planning, couldn't possibly be the product of the penduline
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tit's own intellect. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
One of the most common methods birds use to protect a nest from predators is to build it in a thorny bush or camouflage it among dry leaves. Some species, in order to protect the female and her eggs, wall off the entrance to their nes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t structure with mud while she is inside, or else mix their saliva with soil to form a sort of mortar they use to build a wall covering the entrance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These can hardly be skills those animals could develop on their own. What, then, enables these birds and o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ther animals to build nests so intricate and perfectly designed? How do animals acquire these skills?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another detail should not be disregarded. At birth, every animal possesses the knowledge of building its characteristic nest. Every member of that species\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, wherever on Earth it might be, builds its nest in the same way. This clearly shows that creatures did not learn their nest-building methods or acquire them in any casual sort of way, but that this knowledge and skill was given them by the same power. Go
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , the All-knowing and All-powerful, creates them together with their skills and gives them this knowledge.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Quite aside from their architectural perfection, the extraordinary dedication that parents invest in building their nests is certainly worth noticing\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. Whereas birds build ordinary nests for themselves, they build ones for their offspring with the utmost care. Considering the different phases involved in nest building, we can better understand the scale of the efforts birds put into it, the energy they
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
invest and the selflessness of their behavior. To build its nest, a bird can carry only a few twigs or grass stalks at a time in its beak, and so must make hundreds of flights to gather the building materials it requires. But this does not discourage the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ird. It continues to forage patiently. It never becomes frustrated, never settles for less, is never too tired or lazy to complete its nest in every last detail.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 According to Darwin's natural selection theory, these animals should be concerned only with th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emselves. In an environment where only the fittest and strongest could succeed in the battle for survival, would animals exhaust themselves so that their vulnerable offspring could survive? What could explain their preparing in advance a secure environmen
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 for the arrival of their vulnerable young? Natural selection cannot answer these questions; neither can the theory of evolution, nor any other atheist ideology. These questions have one answer only: God gives to these animals dedication, patience, endura
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ce, persistence and ambition. God instills them with these qualities so that the strong can protect the weak, so that natural balances can continue and these species can exist until their appointed times and can become living signs of God's artistry, powe

fs, or even amidst tall grass, provide a safe, hidden shelter for the chicks.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another purpose of the nests is to provide protection from the cold. Birds are hatched featherless, and since their muscles do not get exercised within the egg, they are relative\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ly immobile and thus need nests to insulate them from the cold. Woven nests in particular trap body heat, providing warmth for the chicks\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
but constructing these structures is a detailed and difficult undertaking. The female builds the nest by carefully we\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ving grasses, twigs, and scavenged yarn over a fairly long period of time. She cushions the inside with feathers, hair and fine grass, thereby further insulating the nest.29 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For every type of nest, finding the right building materials is essential. Birds \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
can spend a whole day in their quest for the building materials their structure needs. Their beaks and talons are designed for carrying and arranging the materials they gather. The male bird chooses the location of the nest, and the female builds it.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nests' features depend on the materials and techniques used in their construction. All building materials for their architectural masterworks must be pliable and compressible. Nests are built taking into account the elasticity, durability and toughness o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the different materials birds use\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
mud, leaves, feathers, cellulose and the like. This increases the structure's durability. Using plant fibers mixed with mud, for instance, prevents cracks from developing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, birds mix the mortar from the materials th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ey gather. One species that uses this technique is the cliff swallow, which builds its nests on cliffs and the walls of buildings, using mud as an adhesive to glue their nests together. They gather mud and feathers and transport them in their beaks to the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
construction site, where they mix mud with their saliva, smearing the mixture against the face of the cliff to form a pot-shaped structure with a round opening on top. This structure they fill with grass, moss, and feathers. Usually they build these struc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ures in cavities under overhanging cliffs, to prevent rain from softening and thus destroying the nest.30

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Naturalists consider \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 these birds' nests to be the most astonishing structures built by birds. This species uses plant fibers and tall plant stems to weave themselves extremely solid nests.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First of all, a weaver bird collects the building materials. It will cut long strips fro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
m leaves or extract the midrib from a fresh green leaf. There is a reason for its choice of fresh leaves: The veins of dry leaves would be stiff and brittle, too difficult to bend, but fresh ones make the work much easier. The weaver bird begins by tying 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he leaf fibers around the twig of a tree. With its foot, it holds down one end of the strip against the twig while taking the other end in its beak. To prevent the fibers from falling away, it ties them together with knots. Slowly it forms a circular shap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that will become the entrance to the nest. Then it uses its beak to weave the other fibers together. During the weaving process, it must calculate the required tension, because if it's too weak, the nest will collapse. Also it needs to be able to visuali
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 z\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e the finished structure, since while building the walls, it must determine where the structure needs to be widened.35 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once it finishes weaving the entrance, it proceeds to weave the walls. To do so, it hangs upside down and keeps on working from the insi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
de of the structure. It will push one fiber under another and pull it along with its beak, until it accomplishes a stunning weaving project.36 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The weaver bird won't just begin building its nest. It proceeds by calculating in advance what it needs to do ne\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 xt\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
first, collecting the most suitable building materials, then forming the entrance before going on to build the walls. It knows perfectly well where to thin or thicken the structure, and where to form a curve. Its behavior displays intelligence and skil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , with no trace of inexperience. With no training, it can do two things at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
holding down one end of the fiber with its feet, while guiding the other end with its beak. None of its movements is coincidental; its every action is conscious and purposeful\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Another member of the weaver bird family builds a solid, rainproof nest. This bird obtains the perfect mortar by gathering plant fibers from the environment and mixing them with its saliva, which gives the plant fibers both elasticity and makes them water
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 proof.}{\f0\insrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Weaver birds repeat this process until their nest is complete. It's no doubt impossible to claim that they have acquired these skills unconsciously, by chance. These birds construct their nests like an architect, construction engineer, and site for
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eman all rolled into one.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Another interesting example of nest building is performed by sociable weaver birds of southern Africa, which nest in a single huge, cooperatively built structure with separate entrances. With the ingenuity of accomplished architec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ts, sociable weavers build these nests, some of which are home to as many as 600 birds.37 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When it comes to nest building, why does this species choose the more complex over the easier option? Can we possibly ascribe to chance the fact that they can build \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
such complex nest structures all by themselves? Surely not\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 like all other creatures in nature, they too act by the directives of God.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, these swifts do have p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
roblem in gathering building materials for their nests. Their feet are too small to let them pick up materials from the ground, as other birds do. So instead, they catch feathers, fragments of dried grass and such materials that float in the air. Then the

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The female hornbill starts work by finding a suitable hole in a tree that will shelter the nest. She narrows the opening on the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 tree by plastering it with pellets of mud she carries in her beak. After entering the nest through the narrowed hole, she seals the entrance with mud that has dropped inside, thus reducing the gap to a beak-size slit. This will protect the female and the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

e fed by the same way.44 Both birds are very patient and dedicated to their offspring. While the female bird sits in this tree hole barely big enough for herself, for three month without ever leaving, and the male never deserts them in all this time.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
From these examples, we have seen that each species of bird has its own way of constructing nests. Each technique requires a design planned in advance, and is of such a complexity that couldn't be expected from creatures without intellect or the faculty o

Many animal species suffer hardship in order to raise and protect their offspring, even risking death on occasion. Some migrate for hundreds of miles to their chosen nesting grounds, where they \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
build sophisticated nests requiring much effort. A few, like the male praying mantis, die after mating; or\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 like the salmon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
All these acts of altruism serve an important purpose: survival of the species. The weak and vulnerable young can survive only if protected and cared for by strong adults. The chances of survival are next to nothing for a newborn deserted at birth or 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 for eggs laid just anywhere. But living beings take it upon themselves to care for their defenseless young without any signs of laziness, hesitation or frustration. Each species fulfills its role, ordained by God, without fail.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another interesting point is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that those species that devote the greatest care and attention to protecting their eggs or young, are those that reproduce in the fewest numbers. Birds, for instance, lay only a limited number of eggs each year, but guard them meticulously. Likewise, lar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er mammals produce only one or two young, but take it upon themselves to protect and care for them for a very long time. Some fish and insects lay thousands of eggs at any one time; and mice have several litters per year. But they do not pay the same atte
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tion to their eggs or offspring. Even if only a few survive, they are enough to guarantee the continuation of the species, because of the original high numbers involved. Were they to try and show the same devotion to every single one of their offspring, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ere would be a significant damage done to the world's ecological balance. For example, were this the case with field mice, who reproduce in great numbers, their population would increase to such an extent that they would overrun the world.51 Reproduction 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s a vital factor in the preservation of the ecological balances, but it is impossible for animals themselves to monitor and balance this factor by conscious control.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
None of these animals is a rational being. They cannot know that they need to reproduce to begin with, nor that they should consider the balances of the ecosystem and act accordingly. However, natural balances are indeed preserved, and each animal exactly

fulfills its responsibilities. This clearly shows that all living things are governed by the same authority. Nothing in nature is unsupervised or uncontrolled; all bow to God, their Creator, and act accordingly.

. Around 25,000 penguins congregate to mate. In May or June, each female lays one egg. The pair will not build a nest for their egg, as their whole environment is a land of ice and snow. Nor will they lay their egg on the ice, because it would not withsta
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d the cold and freeze instantly. That is why the female carries the egg on her feet. A few hours after the female lays the egg, the male joins her, and they stand breast to breast. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The male takes the egg from the female, both making sure that the egg does\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n't make contact with the ice. He pushes his toes under the egg, then raises them to roll it onto his feet, doing this with utmost care and attention so as not to break the egg by accident. After this difficult exercise, he buries the egg in his feathers.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Producing the egg has almost exhausted the female penguin's fat reserves, and she must immediately return to the sea to find food and restore her body fat to its former level. This is why the male needs to incubate her egg. But this is a much more difficu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t incubation period than other birds experience, and requires much patience. A male penguin never puts the egg down on the ice and therefore, he is almost completely immobile. He can move for only a few meters by dragging his feet and using his tail like 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 third foot. He rests on his heels while raising his toes, to prevent the precious egg from rolling onto the ice to freeze. Because his feet are covered by feathers, the temperature there is 80 degrees Centigrade (176 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tside air. The egg never gets chilled by the freezing cold.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As the Southern Hemisphere winter progresses, snowstorms begin to wreak havoc. Winds can reach speeds of 120-160 kilometers an hour (75-95 mph). Under these murderous conditions, the male penguins\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 go without food for a month and hardly ever move, proving their dedication for their offspring. In order not to freeze, male penguins huddle closer together, forming a solid bloc. To prevent cold air from blowing in between them, they press their beaks a

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once the wasp has arranged the nest and food for its young, it's time to cater for the larva's safety. Carefully it conceals the entrance with soil and little pebb\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
les. It picks up a little pebble with its jaws and uses it like a hammer to drive the soil level with the ground. Then it rakes the surface with its spiky legs and sweeps the ground until the burrow's entrance is perfectly concealed. But this is still not
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
good enough for the wasp! As a precautionary measure, it digs a few dummy burrows nearby. In this enclosed and well-protected burrow, with the food it has, the larva will develop into an adult and can then emerge by itself.80 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The wasp will never see its y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 must be enabled to do so by a knowledgeable, intelligent power.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As mentioned before, evolutionists say that animals are programmed to behave in this way. According to their theory, this program originated in a series of random occurrences. If we consider t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Evolutionists' claim that animals are engaged in a great struggle for survival, and must compete with one another in order to survive, is disproved by the lives of herd animals. Except during mating season, animals mostly do not compete but take advantage

1. One striking aspects of colony life is that all ants share food. If two ants from the same colony meet, one hungry and the other with a belly full of digested or semi-digested food, the hungry ant will ask the other one to share some. This kind of requ
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 st is never turned down. Ants also feed their larvae from the food in their stomachs and often, end up keeping less for themselves than what they offer to others.133}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10365038

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. In ant colonies, there is perfect sharing of tasks, and each ant fulfills its responsi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
bility with great devotion. The responsibility of the "soldier ant" is to guard the entrance to the nest. It will admit only ants belonging to its colony and refuse entrance to all others. The heads of these guard ants serve as a living "gate" to the nest
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  They guard the entrance all day and never leaving it unattended.134 In the case of an attack, these ants form the first line of defense.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{
\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. Along with sharing food, ants will also share, with as many other ants they can, information about the location of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 food sources. In their behavior, there is no sign of selfish struggle. The ant who discovers a new source of food eats her fill and then returns to the nest, leaving behind a chemical trail on the way by touching her lower abdomen to the ground at regula
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  intervals. Also, she goes around the nest three to six times, speedily communicating the news to the other ants and on returning to the source of food, is accompanied by many others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  4. Medium-sized workers in a colony of leaf-cutting ants spend their wh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ole day transporting leaves. During this time, they are exposed and highly vulnerable to attacks, especially from a species of fly that deposits its eggs onto the ants' heads. The maggots hatching from these eggs will feed on the ant's head and decapitate
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it by eating into its brain. When carrying leaves, worker ants are defenseless against these flies, but other ants will fight back for them. Smaller ants from the same colony take up positions on the leaves being carried back to the nest and fight off the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e predatory flies.135}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
5. Some ants feed on the highly sugary digestive wastes of aphids, which is why they are known as honey ants. They carry this sugary substance they extract from the aphids to their nest, where they store it using a very original meth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
od. A few of the worker ants serve as living storage tanks. Ants returning to their nest regurgitate the food into their mouths, and those ants store it in their lower abdomens, which can inflate to the size of blueberries.136 Each chamber contains betwee
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  25 to 30 of them, each dangling from the ceiling, where she remains immobile. Should one of them fall to the ground, the other ants will return her to her original position. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These living storage tanks can hold up to eight times the original mass of the a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nt. During winters or droughts, hungry ants visit them to feed. The hungry insect puts her mouth into the mouth of the "storage" ant which, by contracting the muscles around her lower abdomen, delivers a drop of nectar to the visitor. These ants couldn't 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ossibly have developed such a method of storing food on their own. Those that serve as living honey jars clearly demonstrate their selfless devotion, by remaining suspended upside down from the ceiling, carrying eight times their own body weight, expectin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nothing in return. Patiently they help to feed other ants of the colony, one by one. Clearly, these ants' system and the physical capabilities that make it possible couldn't be the results of chance. In each generation of honey ants, a few take it upon t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 emselves to serve in this way, which proves that all of them act on the inspiration of their Lord God.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 6. One method that ants use to defend their colony is to commit suicide. They can deliver their kamikaze attacks against an enemy in a variety of ways. O\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ne of the most interesting examples is provided by a species living in the rainforests of Malaysia. This ant has a venom gland stretching from its jaw towards the back of its body. If confronted by an enemy, the ant contracts its abdominal muscles so forc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fully that the gland and surrounding tissues burst, spraying the enemy with its poison before it dies.137}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{
\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 7. In order to reproduce, male and female ants must be very dedicated. Soon after their mating flight, the winged male ants expire. The female looks \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
for a suitable place to build her nest and when she finds one, will enter it and break off her wings. Then she seals off the entrance and remains inside without food for weeks, even months, all alone. Later she will lay her first eggs as a queen ant. The 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nly things she will have eaten in all this time are her own wings. The very first larvae that emerge she feeds with her saliva. This is a period of great devotion for the queen ant, in beginning a new colony.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 8. If their nest is attacked and occupied, the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ants move to protect their brood at any cost. The soldier ants move to the area under attack to fight the invaders, while workers rush to the nursery chambers, evacuating the larvae and young ants between their jaws. They carry them outside the nest and h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
de them somewhere safe until the attack has been fought off.138 It would be expected for a creature like the ant to be concerned only with itself, seeking a place to hide. But the worker ants, soldiers and those guarding the entrance aren't concerned abou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  their own lives and will die for one another if necessary. This is selfless devotion at the highest level, and all ants have been behaving in this way for millions of years.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thus far, we have related astonishing behavior in the animal kingdom, but still n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 significant to be ignored. With their little brains that cannot be seen by the naked eye, consisting of so few nerve cells, they perform intelligent actions that wouldn't be expected of them. For millions of years, they have been obeying their Creator Go
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 's orders in great discipline and without fail. They have surrendered to Him and move only by His will. All beings submit to God like the ants. As the Qur'an says:

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A similar display of harmony and solidarity can be observed in hives. The devotion of worker bees is especially reminiscent of ants.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A beehive's population consists of the queen, the drone males responsible for fertilizing the queen and the hundreds if not thousands of worker bees\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. All work is performed by the workers: building the combs, cleaning and defending the hive, feeding the queen and the drones, caring for the larvae, building and preparing the brooding chambers according to the type of bee (worker, queen, drone) that wil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 develop inside, cleaning the hive and regulating its humidity and temperature, feeding the larvae according their specific needs (nectar, honey and pollen), and collecting nectar, pollen, water and resins.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can list the phases of a worker bee's life and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  its devotional behavior as follows:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. A worker's lifespan is between four and six weeks. Once it emerges from the pupal stage, it works for approximately three }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
weeks inside the hive. Its first job is to nurse the developing larvae. The worker lives off t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he pollen and honey from the feed store, but feeds most of it to the larvae. It regurgitates some of the food it has eaten, mixes it with substances drawn from glands inside its head, and feeds this mixture to the larvae.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How does a creature which has just\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 emerged from the pupa know its job? Why do all bees comply without objection? The bee ought to emerge from the pupa and seek to continue its own life without showing any signs of conscious devotion. But not so: The bee fulfills its nursing duties in a hi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hly disciplined, responsible manner.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. When the bee is approximately twelve days old, its wax glands develop and it begins to restore and build the hexagonal comb structures in which larvae develop and honey is stored.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
3. Between the age of twelve days and three weeks, the worker receives the pollen and nectar brought back to the hive by the other bees, converts it into honey and stores it. It also cleans the hive, removing from it dead bees and other waste.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4. When it h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
as reached the age of three weeks, it's old enough to gather the nectar, pollen, water and resins needed in the hive. These mature workers leave the hive to look for flowers and nectar. Obtaining food is a tiring process: After only two to three weeks, a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 orker bee will die of exhaustion.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 139}{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 However, a point hard to explain is that each bee produces far more honey than it requires for its own needs. It is impossible for evolutionists to explain why \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an unthinking creature, supposedly in a struggle for its own survival, should persist in this hard work without ever giving up.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here we confront another sign of God. As stated before, God reveals in Sura 16 that He commands the bee to make honey. This is w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In each hive, there are bees guarding the entrance. Their duty is to fight off intruders trying to enter the hive. Every creature that does not have the hive's resident scent is c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a bee stings the enemy, she will inject as much venom as possible, giving off a stronger odor. The stronger the odor, the fiercer her mates become.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 140}{

such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of pro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
teins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molec\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ing of 500 pages each.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ey both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rom one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave sim\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ilar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038

 by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism. }{

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
illions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally under\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 mines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. }{

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganath\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an explains this as follows:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
orse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.150}{

, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actua
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "evolution" could have taken place.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
all oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a serie
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to ach
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 arpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is fr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
om light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9665616\charrsid10365038

claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of scien\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ce. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewon\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between mat

er such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Anyone who does not look at the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed
