\f0\fs22\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism.

\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author's books has a symbolic meaning linked to the their contents. This seal represents the Qur'an, the last Book and the last word of God, and our Pro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
het, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 aised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eople, thus encouraging them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Eve
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 if they continue to advocate, this will be only a sentimental insistence since these books have refuted these ideologies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books writt
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, no mat
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 erial gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Mean\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
while, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has attained are manifest in the reader's conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point needs to be kept in mi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by ensuring that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
verybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the Will of God, these books will be the means through which people \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in the 21st century will attain the peace and bliss, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For centuries, people searched for an answer to the question of "how the universe came into being". Thousands of models of the universe have been p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ut forward and thousands of theories have been produced throughout history. However, a review of these theories reveals that they all have at their core one of two different models. The first is the concept of an infinite universe without beginning, which
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 no longer has any scientific basis. The second is that the universe was created from nothing, which is currently recognized by the scientific community as "the standard model". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The first model, which has proven not to be viable, defended the proposition t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hat the universe has existed for an infinite time and will exist endlessly in its current state. This idea of an infinite universe was developed in ancient Greece, and made its way to the western world as a product of the materialistic philosophy that was
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
revived with Renaissance. At the core of the Renaissance lay a re-examination of the works of ancient Greek thinkers. Thus, materialist philosophy and the concept of an infinite universe defended by this philosophy were taken off the dusty shelves of hist
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ry by philosophical and ideological concerns and presented to people as if they were scientific facts. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Materialists like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels vigorously embraced this idea, which prepared an apparently solid ground for their materialist ideologi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es, thereby playing an important role in introducing this model to the 20}{\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 th}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  century. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 According to this "infinite universe" model which was popular during the first half of the 20}{\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 th}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  century, the universe had no beginning or end. The universe had not been c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reated from nothing, nor would it ever be destroyed. According to this theory, which also laid the basis for materialist philosophy, the universe had a static structure. Yet, later scientific findings revealed that this theory is totally wrong and unscien
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ific. The universe has not existed without beginning; it had a beginning and was created from nothing. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The idea that the universe is infinite, that is that it had no beginning, has always been the starting point of irreligiousness and ideologies that make\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the mistake of denying Allah. This is because in their view, if the universe had no beginning, then there was no creator either. Yet, science soon revealed with conclusive evidence that these arguments of the materialists are invalid and that the univers
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  started with an explosion called the Big Bang. Coming into being from nothing had only one meaning: "Creation". Allah, the Almighty created the whole universe. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The renowned British astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle was among those who were disturbed by this fact. With his "steady-state" theory, Hoyle accepted that the universe was expanding and argued that the universe was infinite in scale and without beginning or end.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
According to this model, as the universe expanded, matter originated spontaneously and in quantities as large as required. This theory, which was based on extremely unworkable premises, and advanced by the sole concern of supporting the idea of an "infini
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e universe without beginning or end" was in direct opposition to the Big Bang theory, which was scientifically proven closer to a great number of observations. Hoyle and others continued to resist this but all scientific development worked against them.}{

 century, great strides were made in the field of astronomy. First, the Russian physicist Alexandre Friedmann discovered in 1922 that the universe did not have a static structure. Starting out fro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
m Einstein's theory of relativity, Friedmann calculated that even a tiny impulse might cause the universe to expand or contract. Georges Lema\'ee\loch\f0 
tre, one of the most famous astronomers of Belgium, was the first to recognise the importance of this calculation\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 These calculations led him to conclude that the universe had a beginning and that it was continuously expanding right from the outset. There was another very important point Lema\'ee\loch\f0 
tre raised: according to him, there should be a radiation surplus left over\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 from the big bang and this could be traced. Lema\'ee\loch\f0 
tre was confident that his explanations were true although they initially did not find much support in the scientific community. Meanwhile, further evidence that the universe was expanding began to pile up.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
At that time, observing a number of stars through his huge telescope, the American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that the stars emitted a red shifted light depending on their distances. With this discovery, which he made at the California Mount Wilso
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Observatory, Hubble challenged all scientists who put forward and defended the steady state theory, and shook the very basis of the model of the universe held until then. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hubble's findings depended on the physical rule that the spectra of light beams tra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
velling towards the point of observation tend towards violet while the spectra of light beams moving away from the point of observation tend towards red. This showed that the celestial bodies observed from the Californian Mount Wilson Observatory were mov

ng away from the earth. Further observation revealed that the stars and galaxies weren't just racing away from us; they were racing away from each other as well. This movement of celestial bodies proved once more that the universe is expanding. In }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Further observations on the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 expansion of the universe gave way to new arguments. Starting from this point, scientists ended up with a model of a universe that became smaller as one went back in time, eventually contracting and converging at a single point, as Lema\'ee\loch\f0 
tre had argued. T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e conclusion to be derived from this model is that at some point in time, all matter in the universe was crushed together in a single point-mass that had "zero volume" because of its immense gravitational force. Our universe came into being as the result 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f the explosion of this point-mass that had zero volume and this explosion has come to be called the "Big Bang". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Big Bang pointed to another matter. To say that something has zero volume is tantamount to saying that it is "nothing". The whole universe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is created from this "nothing". Furthermore, this universe has a beginning, contrary to the view of materialism, which holds that "the universe has existed from eternity".

\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once the fact that the universe started to form after a \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
great explosion was established, astrophysicists gave a further boost to their researches. According to George Gamow, if the universe was formed in a sudden, cataclysmic explosion, there ought to be a definite amount of radiation left over from that explo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion which should be uniform throughout the universe.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the years following this hypothesis, scientific findings followed one another, all confirming the Big Bang. In 1965, two researchers by the name of Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson chanced upon a form o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f radiation hitherto unnoticed. Called "cosmic background radiation", it was unlike anything coming from anywhere else in the universe for it was extraordinarily uniform. It was neither localised nor did it have a definite source; instead, it was distribu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed equally everywhere. It was soon realised that this radiation is the relic of the Big Bang, still reverberating since the first moments of that great explosion. Gamow had been spot-on, for the frequency of the radiation was nearly the same value that sc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 entists had predicted. Penzias and Wilson were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discovery. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It took only eight minutes for George Smoot and his NASA team to confirm the levels of radiation reported by Penzias and Wilson, thanks to the COBE space satellite\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. The sensitive sensors on board the satellite earned a new victory for the Big Bang theory. The sensors verified the existence of the hot, dense form remaining from the first moments of the Big Bang. COBE captured evidentiary remnants of the Big Bang, an

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Other evidence had to do with the relative amounts of hydrogen and helium in the universe. Calculations revealed that the proportion of hydrogen-helium gasses in the universe is in accord with the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oretical calculations of what should remain after the Big Bang.
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The discovery of compelling evidence caused the Big Bang theory to gain the complete approval of the scientific world. In an article in its October 1994 issue, }{\i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276

 seconds. This time period indicates one hundredth of a second. By now, the t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emperature is 100 billion degrees. At this point, the "early universe" has started to form. Particles like the proton and neutron forming the nucleus of the atom have not yet appeared. There is only the electron and its antiparticle, the positron (anti-el
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ctron), because the temperature and speed of the universe at that point only allow the formation of these particles. In less than a second after the explosion has taken place out of nothing, electrons and positrons have formed. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 From this moment on, the ti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
me of the formation of each sub-atomic particle is very important. Every particle has to emerge at a specific moment so that the current rules of physics may be established. It is of great importance which particle is to form first. Even a slight deviatio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  in the sequence or timing would make it impossible for the universe to take its current shape.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us stop now and do some thinking. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Big Bang theory provides evidence for Allah's being by showing that all matter comprising the universe originated fro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m nothingness. It did even more and showed that the building blocks \hich\f0 
\endash \loch\f0  the atoms \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  also came into existence from nothing less than one second after the Big Bang. The enormous equilibrium and order in these particles are worthy of note. The universe owes it
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 present state to this equilibrium that will be described in more detail in the pages ahead. It is again this equilibrium that allows us to live a peaceful life. In short, perfect order and un-changing laws, "the laws of physics", have formed following an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
explosion that would normally be expected to create great turmoil and disorder. This proves that each moment following the creation of the universe, including the Big Bang, has been designed perfectly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let us continue looking at the developments from\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  where we left off. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The next step is the moment at which a time of 10}{\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 -1}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 seconds has elapsed. At this moment, the temperature is 30 billion degrees. Not even one second has elapsed from t = 0 moment to this stage. By now, neutrons and protons, the other pa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rticles of the atom, have started to appear. The neutrons and protons, the perfect structures of which we will analyse in the following sections, were created out of nothing within a time period even shorter than a second. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us come to the first second \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
after the explosion. The massive density at this time again gives a colossal figure. According to calculations, the density value of the mass present at that stage is 3.8 billion kilograms per litre. It may be easy to express this figure, termed as billio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s of kilograms, arithmetically, and to show it on paper. Yet, it is impossible to conceive of this figure exactly. To give a very simple example to express the magnitude of this figure, we can say "if Mount Everest in the Himalayas had this density, it co
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ld swallow our world in a moment with the force of gravitation it would possess."}{\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 7}{
\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most distinctive characteristic of the subsequent moments is that by then, the temperature has reached a considerably lower level. At that stage, the universe is appro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ximately 14 seconds old, has a temperature of 3 billion degrees and continues to expand at a dramatic speed. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is the stage where the steady atomic nuclei, like hydrogen and helium nuclei, have started to form. One proton and one neutron have for the f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
irst time found conditions conducive to their co-existing. These two particles, which have a mass straddling the line between existence and non-existence, have, because of the force of gravitation, started resisting the tremendous rate of expansion. It is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
obvious that a dramatically conscious and controlled process is in progress here. A massive explosion gives way to great equilibrium and precise order. Protons and neutrons have started to come together to form the atom, the building block of matter. It i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  certainly totally impossible for these particles to have the power and consciousness to establish the delicate balances required for the formation of matter. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During the epoch following this formation, the temperature of the universe has dropped to one bi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
llion degrees. This temperature is 60 times the temperature at the core of our sun. Only 3 minutes and 2 seconds have elapsed from the first instant to this one. By now, sub-atomic particles like photons, protons, anti protons, neutrinos and anti-neutrino
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 are abundant. The quantities of all the particles existing in this phase and their interactions with each other are extremely critical. So much so that the slightest variation in the quantity of any particle will destroy the energy level set by them and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 revent the conversion of energy into matter. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Take electrons and positrons for example: when electrons and positrons come together, energy is produced. Therefore, the numbers of both particles are very important. Let us say that 10 units of electrons and 8
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 units of positrons meet. In this case, 8 of the 10 units of electrons interact with 8 units of positrons and produce energy. As a result, 2 units of electrons are released. Since the electron is one of the particles forming the atom that is the building 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lock of the universe, it has to be available in required quantities in this stage so that the universe may exist. To take up the abovementioned example, if the number of positrons was more than that of the electrons, then positrons would be left over inst
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ad of electrons as a result of the energy released and the material universe would never be formed. If the numbers of positrons and electrons were equal, then only energy would be produced and nothing left to form the material universe. Yet, this excess i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the number of electrons has been arranged in such a way as to match the number of protons in the universe in the time that follows this moment. In the atom that will form later on, the numbers of electrons and protons will be equal. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The numbers of partic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
les that emerged in the aftermath of the Big Bang were determined with so precise a calculation, finally leading to the formation of the material universe. Professor Steven Weinberg remarks on how critical is the interaction between these particles:

also gave rise to all the enormous systems contained within the universe today, as well as the atoms, molecules, planets, suns, solar systems, galaxies, quasars etc., according to a magnificent plan, and in perfect order and balance. While it is impossibl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Yet there is one thing even more surprising than that: although its size is one ten billionth of an atom's size, the nucleus' mass comprises 99.95% of the mass of the atom. How is it that something constitutes almost all of a given mass, while, on the oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er hand, occupying almost no space?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason is that the density comprising the mass of the atom is not distributed evenly throughout the whole atom. That is, almost the entire mass of the atom is accumulated in the nucleus. Say, you have a house of 10 b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
illion square metres and you have to put all the furniture in the house in a room of one square metre. Can you do this? Of course you cannot. Yet, the atomic nucleus is able to do this thanks to a tremendous force unlike any other force in the universe. T
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is force is the "strong nuclear force", one of the four fundamental forces in the universe we mentioned in the previous chapter. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We had noted that this force, the most powerful of the forces in nature, keeps the nucleus of an atom intact and keeps it from\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fragmenting. All the protons in the nucleus have positive charges and they repel each other because of the electro-magnetic force. However, due to the strong nuclear force, which is 100 times stronger than the repulsive force of the protons, the electro-
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 agnetic force becomes ineffective, and thus the protons are held together. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To sum up, there are two great forces interacting with each other inside an atom so small as to be unseen to us. The nucleus is able to stay together as a whole owing to the precis\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e values of these forces. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
When we consider the size of the atom and the number of atoms in the universe, it is impossible to fail to notice that there is tremendous equilibrium and design at work. It is crystal clear that the fundamental forces in the uni
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
verse have been created in a very special way with great wisdom and power. The only thing those who reject faith resort to is nothing other than claiming that all of these came into being as a result of "coincidences". Probabilistic calculations, however,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
scientifically put the probability of the equilibriums in the universe being formed "coincidentally" at "0". All these are clear evidence of the existence of Allah and the perfection of His creation.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The electric charge they carry obliges electrons to obey certain laws of physics. One of these laws of physics is that "same electrical charges repel each other and opposite charges at\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
First, under normal circumstances, the electrons, all negatively charged, would be expected to repel each other by obeying this rule and shoot away from the nucleus. Yet, this does not happen. If the electrons were scattered from the nuc

leus, then the universe would consist of idle protons, neutrons and electrons wandering in the void. Second, the positively charged nucleus would be expected to attract the negative charged electrons and the electrons would stick to the nucleus. In that c

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, none of these things occur. The abovementioned extraordinary escape velocities of the electrons (1,000 km/sec), the repelling force they exert on each other and the force\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of attraction the nucleus exerts on the electrons are based on such precise values that these three contradicting factors perfectly balance each other. As a result, this outstanding system inside the atom runs without falling apart. Even if a single one

equal charges could not even come close to each other, much less bond together in a nucleus. In the same manner, the neutrons would never be able to stick to the nucleus. As a result, there would be no nucleus and therefore, no atom.

trons inside the atom. You may think "What do the motions of electrons have to do with colours?" Let's briefly explain this relationship: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Electrons revolve only in electron shells. We just mentioned that there are 7 electron shells. Each electron shell ha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s a specific level of energy, which varies depending on the distance of the shell from the nucleus. The closer an electron shell is to the nucleus, the less energy its electrons have, and the farther it is to the nucleus, the more energy its electrons hav
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each electron shell has "sub-shells", among which the electrons of that shell continuously move. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An electron needs to receive external energy to be able to travel outwards between the shells. The source of this energy is the "photon". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In its simplest terms, the photon is a "light particle". Every star in the universe is a source of photons. The most important source of photons for our world is, of course, the sun. Photons are diffused throughout space from the sun at a speed of 300,000
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 km a second.}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
When these photons, arriving on earth from the sun, strike the atoms of objects on earth, the electrons of atoms sometimes begin their travel. If the electrons that are able to travel by the help of this energy rise to a higher energy shell a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To sum up, the colour of an object in fact consists of a mixture of these ligh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t particles that are absorbed, then emitted by this object, and reach our eyes. The colour of an object that does not emit light itself but reflects the light it receives from the sun depends both on the light it receives and the change it makes on this l
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ght. If the object illuminated with white light appears "red", this is because it absorbs a large portion of the mixture that arrives to it from the sunrays and emits only red. By saying "it absorbs", we mean the following: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As mentioned before, every shel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l has sub-shells and electrons travel between these sub-shells. Each shell corresponds to a specific level of energy, and electrons carry as much energy as allowed by the energy level of the shell on which they circle. Shells that are more distant from th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nucleus, have higher energy. When a space for one electron becomes available in an upper shell, the electron suddenly disappears, and then re-appears again in that sub-shell with higher energy level. Yet, in order for the electron to perform this, it has
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to raise its energy level to the level required by the shell to which it jumps. The electron increases its energy level by absorbing (swallowing) photon particles coming from the sun. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can make the situation clearer with a few examples. Let us consider \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the Morpho Butterfly. The pigments on the butterfly absorb the entire sunlight re-emitting only the colour blue. When the light particles for that reflected colour reach the retina in the eye, they are converted to electrical signals by the cone cells in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he retina in such a way to be perceived as blue and sent to the brain. Eventually, the colour blue is formed in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This means that the colour of an object depends on the character of the light emitted from the light source and how much of this lig\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ht is re-emitted by the object in question. For instance, the colour of a dress is not the same under sunlight and in a store. If an object is perceived as black by our brain, it means that this object absorbs all the light coming from the sun reflecting 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
one to the outside. In the same manner, if the object reflects all light coming from the sun and does not absorb any of it, then it is perceived as white by our brain. In this case, the points that need careful consideration are the following: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. The colo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ur of an object depends on the properties of the light emitted by the light source. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. The colour of an object depends on the reaction of the electrons of the molecules in its structure, as to which light these electrons will absorb and which they will no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. The colour of an object depends on how our brain will perceive the photon striking the retina. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here, let us stop and think once more. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The electrons that revolve at incredible speed around the nucleus of the atom, which is a matter too small to be \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
seen with the eye, suddenly disappear from their own shells and jump to another place called a sub-shell. There also needs to be a space available on the sub-shell for this leap. They are supplied the energy they require during the process by absorbing ph
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tons. They then go back to their original orbits. During this action, colours perceivable by the human eye are formed. What's more, atoms in number expressible in trillions keep doing this every moment, thanks to which we are able to view an uninterrupted
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "image".

This magnificent mechanism is not comparable to the operation of any man-made machine. A clock, for instance, has a highly complex mechanism in itself, and all the parts of a clock (gears, discs, screws, nuts, etc.) must be located in the right p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
laces in the right way for a clock to work properly. The smallest problem in this mechanism would impede the mechanism of the clock. Yet, when we think of the structure of an atom and how the abovementioned mechanism of the electrons works, the simplicity
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of the structure of a clock is better understood. As we said, the mechanism of the electrons is too complex, perfect and flawless to be compared to any man-made system. Definitely, a system that has such mind-boggling complexity and runs so perfectly coul

As explained above, chemical bonds are formed through the motion of electrons in the outermost electron shells of the atoms. Each atom has a tendency to fill up its outermost shell with the maximum number of electrons it may shelter. The m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aximum number of electrons the atoms can hold in their outermost shells is 8. To do this, atoms either receive electrons from other atoms to complete the electrons in their outermost shells to eight, or if they have lesser electrons in their outermost she
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ls, then they give these to another atom, making a sub-shell that had previously been completed in their outermost orbits. The tendency of the atoms to exchange electrons constitutes the basic inciting force of the chemical bonds they form between each ot

This driving force, that is, the objective of the atoms to raise the number of electrons in their outermost shells to maximum, causes an atom to form three types of bonds with other atoms. These are the ionic bond, covalent bond and metallic bond.

Carbon is the most vital element for living beings, because all living organisms are constructed from compounds of carbon. Numerous pages would not be enough to describe the properties of the car\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
bon atom, which is extremely important for our existence. Nor has the science of chemistry yet been able to discover all of its properties. Here we will mention only a few of the very important properties of carbon. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Structures as diverse as the cell membr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ane, the horns of an elk, the trunk of a redwood, the lens of the eye, and the venom of a spider are composed of carbon compounds. Carbon, combined with hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen in many different quantities and geometric arrangements, results in a v
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 st assortment of materials with vastly different properties. So, what is the reason for carbon's ability to form approximately 1.7 million compounds?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the most significant properties of carbon is its ability to form chains very easily by lining carbo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n atoms up one after another. The shortest carbon chain is made up of two carbon atoms. Despite the unavailability of an exact figure on the number of carbons that make up the longest carbon chain, we can talk about a chain with seventy links. If we consi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for carbon's ability to form chains with so many links is beca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 use its chains are not exclusively linear. Chains may be branched, as they may also form polygons. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this point, the form of the chain plays a very important role. In two carbon compounds, for example, if the carbon atoms are the same in number yet combi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ned in different forms of chains, two different substances are formed. The abovementioned characteristics of the carbon atom produce molecules that are critical for life. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some carbon compounds' molecules consist of just a few atoms; others contain thousan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, how do molecules combine to form matter? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Since molecules become stable after their formation, they no longer swap atoms. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, what holds them together?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In an effort to answer this question, chemists produced different theories. Research \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
showed that molecules are able to combine in different ways depending on the properties of the atoms in their composition. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These bonds are very important for organic chemistry, which is the chemistry of living beings, because the most important molecules \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
constituting life are formed due to their ability to form these bonds. Let us take the example of proteins. The complex three-dimensional shapes of proteins, which are the building blocks of living things, are formed thanks to these bonds. This means that
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the weak chemical bond between molecules is at least as necessary as the strong chemical bond between atoms for the formation of life. Certainly, the strength of these bonds must be of a certain measure. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can continue with the protein example. Molecules\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 called amino acids combine to form proteins, which are much larger molecules. The atoms forming amino acids are combined by covalent bonds. Weak bonds combine these amino acids in such a way as to produce three-dimensional patterns. Proteins can function
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in living organisms only if they have these three dimensional patterns. Therefore, if these bonds did not exist, neither would the proteins, or, therefore, life exist.

gine that hydrogen and oxygen molecules, which are the components of water, are put in a glass bowl. Let us leave them in the bowl for a very long time. These gases may still not form water even if they remain in the bowl for hundreds of years. Even if th

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason why water forms so slowly under these circumstances is temperature. At room temperat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ure, oxygen and hydrogen react very slowly.

 molecules. To combine to form the water molecule, they must collide. As a result of this collision, the bonds forming the hydrogen and oxygen molecules weak\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
en, leaving no hindrance for the combination of oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Temperature raises the energy and therefore, the speed of these molecules, resulting in an increase in the number of collisions. Thus, it accelerates the course of the reaction. Ho
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ever, currently, no temperature high enough to form water exists on earth. The heat required for the formation of water was supplied during the formation of the earth, which resulted in the emergence of so much water as to cover three quarters of the eart

's surface. At present, water evaporates and rises to the atmosphere where it cools and returns to the earth in the form of rain. That is, there is no increase in the quantity; only a perpetual cycle.

w, let us briefly see how water is formed chemically. The electrical charge of water is zero, that is, it is neutral. Yet, due to the sizes of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, the oxygen component of the water molecule has a slightly negative charge and its
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hydrogen component has a slightly positive charge.}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
When more than one water molecule come together, positive and negative charges attract each other to form a very special bond called "the hydrogen bond". The \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hydrogen bond is a very weak bond and it is incomprehensibly short-lived. The duration of a hydrogen bond is approximately one hundred billionth of a second. But as soon as a bond breaks, another one forms. Thus, water molecules adhere tightly to each oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r while also retaining their liquid form because they are combined with a weak bond. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hydrogen bonds also enable water to resist temperature changes. Even if air temperature increases suddenly, water temperature increases slowly and, similarly, if air temp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erature falls suddenly, water temperature drops slowly. Large temperature changes are needed to cause considerable changes in water temperature. The significantly high thermal energy of water has major benefits for life. To give a simple example, there is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a great amount of water in our bodies. If water adapted to the sudden vicissitudes of temperature in the air at the same rate, we would suddenly develop fevers or freeze. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 By the same token, water needs a huge thermal energy to evaporate. Since water uses \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
up a great deal of thermal energy while evaporating, its temperature drops. To give an example, again from the human body, the normal temperature of the body is 36}{\f0\fs22\cf1\up4\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 0}{

 C interval is indeed v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ery small and even working under the sun for a few hours can increase body temperature by that amount. Yet, our bodies spend a great amount of thermal energy through sweating, that is, by causing the water it contains to evaporate, which in turn causes bo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y temperature to drop. If our bodies did not have such an automatic mechanism, working for even a few hours under the sun could be fatal. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hydrogen bonds equip water with yet another extraordinary property, which is water's being more viscous in its liquid\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 state than in its solid state. As a matter of fact, most substances on earth are more viscous in their solid states than in their liquid states. Contrary to other substances, however, water expands as it freezes. This is because hydrogen bonds prevent wa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er molecules from bonding to each other too tightly, and thus many gaps are left in between them. Hydrogen bonds are broken down when water is in liquid state, which causes oxygen atoms to come closer to each other and form a more viscous structure. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
also causes ice to be lighter than water. Normally, if you melt any metal and throw in it a few solid pieces of the same metal, these pieces would sink directly to the bottom. In water, however, things are different. Icebergs weighing ten thousands of ton
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  float on water like corks. So, what benefit can this property of water provide us? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us answer this question with the example of a river: When the weather is very cold, it is not the whole river, but only the surface of it that freezes. Water reaches i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ts heaviest state at + 4}{

r has revealed that what we call matter is not an entity having a specific colour, smell and form, as we believed it to be. What we imagine to be matter, that is our own body, our room, our home, and at large, the world and the whole universe, is in reali
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y nothing but energy. What is it then that makes everything around us visible and touchable? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason why we perceive the things around us as matter is the collision of electrons in the orbital shells of atoms with photons, and the atoms' attracting and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  repelling each other. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 You are not even touching the book that you think you hold in your hand right now\'85\loch\f0 
 In truth, the atoms of your hand are repelling the atoms of the book and you feel a sense of touch depending on the intensity of this repulsion. As w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e mentioned while talking about the structure of atoms, they can come close to each other at most as much as the diameter of an atom. Besides, the only atoms that can come this close are those that react with each other. Therefore, when even atoms of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ame substance can by no means touch each other, it is all the more impossible for us to touch the substance we hold, squeeze or lift with our hand. In fact, if we could come as close as possible to the object in our hand, we would be involved in a chemica
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 reaction with that object. In this case, it would be impossible for a human being or another living being to survive even for a second. The living being would immediately react with the substance on which he stepped, sat or leaned, and be transformed int
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  something else. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The final picture that emerges in this situation is extremely remarkable: we live in a world that is 99.95 % composed of a void filled with atoms consisting almost entirely of energy.}{

 and we hold". So, to what extent do we perceive the matter we see, hear or smell? Are these substances really as we see or hear them? Absolutely not. We had addressed this point when we talked about electrons and molecules. Remember, it is literally impo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sible for us to see the matter we believe to exist and see, because the phenomenon we call seeing comprises certain images formed in our brain by photons coming from the sun, or from another light source, hitting the matter, which absorbs a certain portio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of the incoming light, and gives out the rest, which therefore is re-emitted from the matter and strikes our eyes. That is to say that the matter we see only consists of the information carried by photons that are reflected to our eye. So, how much of th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  data related to matter is conveyed to us by this information? We have no proof that the original forms of the matters existing outside are fully reflected to us.

 gasoline, can it fly? Of course it still cannot. Only if we bring together these materials in a way so as to form an airplane, can they fly. So, what makes an airplane fly? Is it the wings? The engine? The pilot? None of these can fly by themselves. In f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rm themselves into animate systems has nothing to do with reason. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
After reading the example we will now quote, you will decide for yourself how realistic these irrational tales are. This is the scenario evolutionists claim, describing the transformation of inanimate and unconscious atoms into animate organisms, and most

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After the Big Bang, atoms, containing precisely balanced forces, somehow brought themselves into being. While some of the atoms, adequate in number to form the whole universe, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
formed the stars and the planets, and some others the earth. Some of the atoms making up the earth initially formed the land and later on, suddenly decided to form living beings! These atoms first transformed themselves into cells with highly complex stru
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tures and then produced copies of the cells they formed by splitting into two, after which they started speaking and hearing. Subsequently, these atoms transformed into university professors viewing themselves under the electron microscope and claiming th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t they came into being coincidentally. Some atoms came together to form civil engineers who construct bridges and skyscrapers, while some others came together to manufacture satellites, space crafts and yet others specialised in the disciplines of physics
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 chemistry and biology. Atoms like carbon, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and iron came together to form, instead of a dark mass, perfect brains of exceptional complexity, the secrets of which have not yet been fully unravelled. These brains started see
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng 3-dimensional images with a perfect resolution never yet achieved by any technology. Some of the atoms formed comedians and laughed at the jokes comedians made. Again, some atoms composed music and enjoyed listening to it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is possible to prolong thi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s story but let us stop here and run an experiment to show that such a story can never be realised. Let evolutionists put atoms, as much as required of all elements forming life, into a barrel. Let them add in this barrel whatever they think necessary for
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
these atoms to unite to form organic matter, and then let them wait. Let them wait for 100 years, 1000 years, and if necessary, for 100 million years transferring responsibility to wait from father to son. Will a professor emerge out of this barrel one da
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
? Certainly not. Regardless of how long they wait, a professor will not come out of this barrel. Not only will there be no professor, but not even a single living being would come out of this barrel. No birds, fishes, butterflies, apples, elephants, roses
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 strawberries, oranges, violets, trees, ants, honeybees, nor even a single mosquito would come out, because even if millions of pieces of organic matter came together, they would not spontaneously acquire the characteristics of a living being. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let us\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  see whether unconscious atoms can spontaneously form the DNA molecule, the cornerstone of life, and proteins. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which is located in the nucleus of the cell, contains the codes carrying the information of all organs and all char\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
acteristics of the body. DNA, which contains all information on the living being it belongs to, is also able to reproduce itself. How a molecule formed by the assemblage of atoms can contain information and how it multiplies by copying itself remain one o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the unanswered questions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Proteins are the buildings blocks of living beings and they play a key role in many vital functions of the organism. For instance, haemoglobin transports oxygen everywhere in our body, antibodies render harmless microbes enterin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g the body, and enzymes help us to digest the food we eat and convert it into energy. The formulae found in our DNA enable the manufacture of 50,000 different types of proteins. As is obvious, proteins are highly crucial for the survival of a living being
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and the absence of even one of these proteins would make life impossible for that living being. It is scientifically impossible for DNA and proteins, each a giant molecule, to be formed spontaneously as a result of sheer coincidence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 DNA is a series of nu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

In the chapter titled "The Formation Adventure of the Atom", we had said the force keeping the protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus is "the strong nuclear force". The enormous power of nuclear energy is revealed by the libera
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tion of a tiny part of this force in the nucleus. The magnitude of this energy varies depending on the type of the element, because the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of each element is different. As the nucleus grows, the number of neutron
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 and protons and the magnitude of the force bonding them to each other increase. It is extremely difficult to release this force that is responsible for keeping protons and neutrons together in a large nucleus. As the particles grow more distant from each
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 other, they, just like a taut bow, try to come together with greater force. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before going into the details of this force, let us think it over. How can such an enormous force fit in such a small place? This is such a force that it has been discovered after\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 years of research conducted by thousands of people. When it is not interfered with, it does not do any harm to anyone, yet, with the intervention of man, it may at any time become a force killing millions.

\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid3347702\charrsid14289276 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Fission is a nuclear reaction in which the atomic nucleus\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, which is held together by the strongest force in the universe, the "Strong Nuclear Force", splits into fragments. The main material used in fission experiments is "uranium" because the uranium atom is one of the heaviest. In other words, there are plent
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fission experiments, scientists shot a neutron at the uranium nucleus at great velocity. They faced a very interesting situation. After the neutron was absorbed by the uranium's nucleus, the uranium nucleus had 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
become very unstable. The nucleus' being "unstable" means the formation of a difference between the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, resulting in an imbalance in its structure. Therefore, the nucleus starts splitting into fragments while em
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tting a certain amount of energy to eliminate this imbalance. The nucleus, under the impact of the energy released, starts ejecting the components it contains at great velocity. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering the results these experiments yielded, neutrons were accelerated \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and uranium was bombarded with neutrons in special environments called "reactors". However, uranium is bombarded with neutrons according to a very fine measure, not randomly, because any neutron bombarding the uranium atom has to hit the uranium immediate
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y and at the desired point. That is why these experiments are conducted taking every probability into consideration. The amount of the uranium to be used, the amount of the neutrons used to bombard the uranium, and the duration and speed at which the neut
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ons will bombard the uranium should all be very precisely calculated. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After all these calculations are made and the appropriate setting is prepared, the nucleus is bombarded with neutrons in such a way that they penetrate the nuclei of the atoms in the ur\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
anium. It is sufficient that the nucleus of at least one of the atoms in this mass is split in two. In this division, an average of two or three neutrons are sent out from the mass of the nucleus at great velocity and high energy. Neutrons that are releas
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d start a chain reaction by colliding with other uranium nuclei within the mass. Each newly split nucleus behaves like the initial uranium nucleus. Thus, a chain of nuclear reactions starts. A large number of uranium nuclei are split into fragments as a r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sult of these chain reactions, causing an enormous amount of energy to be released. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It was these nuclei divisions that have caused the Hiroshima and Nagasaki disasters, causing the death of tens of thousands of people. At the moment of the detonation of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
her 40,000 people right at the moment of detonation. While the power released by the nuclei caused the death of many people, it also destroyed a very large residential area, and gave rise to many irreparable genetic and physiological disorders in the rema
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ning residents of that area, due to the radiation released, which was to affect generations to come. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If our earth, the whole atmosphere, everything animate and inanimate including us, are composed of atoms, what prevents atoms from being involved in nucle\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ar reactions like the ones in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that could occur anytime and anywhere?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The neutrons are created in such a way that, when they are free in nature \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  without being linked to a nucleus \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  they are subjected to a decomposition called "beta 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 decay". Because of this disintegration, no neutrons wander freely in nature. Therefore, neutrons that are to be used in nuclear reactions must be obtained through artificial methods. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This makes clear that, Allah, the Creator of the entire universe, create\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

With your body made up of atoms, you are breathing atoms in the air, eating atoms in food and drinking atoms of water. What you see is nothing other than the collision of electrons of the atoms in your eye with photons. And what about what you feel by tou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h? The sensations are simply formed by atoms in your skin repelling atoms of objects.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Indeed, almost everyone knows today that his body, the universe, the world, in short, everything consists of atoms. Yet, perhaps, most people so far never thought about w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hat kind of a system the entity we call the atom has. Or, even if they did, they did not feel the need to investigate it, because they always thought this concerns physicists alone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Man, however, lives entwined within this perfect system throughout his lif\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e. This is such a system that every one of the trillions of atoms forming the armchair on which we sit has an order about which a book could be written. It takes pages to tell the formation, the system and the power of a single atom.

ausibility of the spontaneous formation of an atom, the building-block of everything, living or non-living, is related and the flawless nature of Allah's creation is demonstrated.

 conventional wisdom, recent developments in science completely disprove the theory. The only reason Darwinism is still foisted on people by means of a worldwide propaganda campaign lies in the ideological aspects of the theory. All secular ideologies and
