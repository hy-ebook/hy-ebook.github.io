\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash 
and therefore, God's Existence\emdash over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into d
oubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject
.
\par 
\par All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the read
er's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously rejec
t spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents.
\par 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another.
\par 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The au
thor's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par 
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read.
\par 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobserva
nt of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

aving completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Har
un Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism.
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names }{\i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 Harun}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424  (Aaron) and }{\i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 Yahya}{
\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 
 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture
) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "las
t word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word.
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one si
ngle goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies.
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide 
readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosni
an), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian.
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together wi
th a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized
 
by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideo
logically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya.
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service.
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate o
ther books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devi
s
ed to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to dissemin
ate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction.
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people
 is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading in
to a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late.
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

e things you see from the moment you wake up in the morning: the pillow under your head, the blanket over you, the alarm clock that woke you up, the slippers you search for as soon as you get out of bed, the window you open to get some fresh air, the clot
h
es hanging in your closet, the mirror you look into every morning, the knife and fork you use for breakfast, the umbrella you take with you when you leave the house, the elevator you get into, the key that opens your car door, the traffic lights along the
 way, the billboards, the pen, paper and other things on your desk at work...
\par Spend some time to consider, and it will no doubt occur to you that each of these things was designed for a special purpose. No one would say that it was a matter of chance that e
verything was where it should be when you arose up in the morning. For example, who would claim that merely by chance, your house key was cut exactly to fit the door? Or that it ended up in your pocket by chance, in the first place? No one would claim tha
t the billboards along the road were put there by chance, or that the meanings they intend came about by randomly painted symbols.
\par By the same token, no one would deny that a staple\emdash nothing other than a specially shaped piece of wire on your desk\emdash was bent a
nd placed in its dispenser in order to hold papers together. Each staple's metal alloy, size, shape, and intended function show the evidence of deliberate design. It was planned specifically to accommodate your needs; and there's a particular reason why s
taples are so often found in any office setting.
\par What about the people you see walking along the street? Or the trees you pass by, the dog that runs out in front of you, the pigeons that build their nests in the eaves of your house, the flowers on your tabl
e, the sky above you? Could their existence be by chance, do you think?
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 It would be nonsense to even consider this possibility! Everything surrounding you, animate and inanimate alike, is too wonderful and complex to be compared with man-made items or ever
 to be ascribed to the operations of chance. Each is an example of a conscious creation, requiring consummate intelligence and skill. Everyone who finds it illogical to think that even a single staple came about by the proper bending of a wire by chance, 
will see that it is even more impossible that human beings, cats, birds, trees and the entire universe emerged by chance.}{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 
\par But today, there are people who cannot see this clear reality. Or rather they see it, but pretend not to. They claim that trees, birds, clouds, houses, cars, you yourself, others around you\emdash 
in short, everything in the universe, animate and inanimate, is all the work of blind chance.
\par These people, known as Materialist-Darwinists, maintain the contradictory idea that chance occurrences can 
display supreme intelligence; and that the sum total of millions of chance events, occurring in sequence, can show creative power. According to Materialist-Darwinists, chance events have greater intelligence than every person in the world\emdash 
no matter how many people have come and gone. They claim that a genius called "chance" has shaped everyone's brain, cognitive ability, judgment, memory, and countless other human characteristics for hundreds of thousands of years.
\par According to Materialist-Darwinists, time 
is the only thing that this brilliant genius needs to bring about such extraordinary events. Their warped logic claims that, if given time, chance can transform a mass of inert, unconscious atoms into, for example, a fig, olive, strawberry, orange, peach,
 
tomato, pomegranate, melon, banana, violet, tulip, orchid, or rose; into ants, butterflies, peacocks, horses, giraffes, and human beings, or any of a million other things you may not think of. Moreover, it claims that chance can bring into existence every
 
star, the sun, and all planets in their orbits. According to Darwinism, all students, doctors, architects, businessmen, engineers, and scientists came into being over the course of time by chance, working patiently with the help of a few minerals, a bit o
f
 water, and sunlight. Interestingly, the deity of chance at the basis of this false idea is, at the same time, used by Materialist-Darwinists in their books, conferences and heated discussions to explain their own chance existence. This is the essence of 
the theory of evolution and the materialist philosophy, which some evolutionist-materialist scientists describe by using Latin words in a difficult, deliberately obscurantist style.
\par In this book, we'll examine the irrationality of those who have entered the
 blind alley of chance, ignoring the wondrous design that surrounds them as well as the proofs of creation, and denying the evident existence of God Who created them and the universe they live in.
\par Before starting our discussion, though, it's useful to poin
t out that Materialist-Darwinists' self-contradictory position arises from a conceptual deficiency that has been common throughout history. In the past, pagans and godless societies carved totems and statues of gods with their own hands, ignorantly believ
ing that images of stone and clay had creative power. God speaks of these people in the Qur'an (25: 2-3):
\par He to Whom the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs. He does not have a son and He has no partner in the Kingdom. He created everything and det
ermined it most exactly. But they have adopted gods apart from Him which do not create anything but are themselves created. They have no power to harm or help themselves. They have no power over death or life or resurrection.

The theory of evolution, as proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, is one of the most unbelievable and irrational claims in history. Despite this, over its 150-year history it's been accepted by many 
scientists, professors, doctors and researchers, and many others who have expended great effort to defend evolution to the point of accepting its scientific contradictions.
\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 This theory puts forth the irrational claim that all plants, animals and human bein
gs are the result of blind, unconscious, accidental events. Evolutionists believe that millions of years ago, in the primal soup of the oceans or in pools of water, mindless atoms with no knowledge, powers of reason came together in certain proportions an
d later, by chance, formed the proteins and cells that even today's scientists with the most advanced laboratory technology have not been able to duplicate. They go so far as to say that these cells, in their turn\emdash and again by sheer chance\emdash 
formed starfish, fish, sparrows, hawks, seagulls, penguins, cats, lambs, lions, and even human beings who possess the faculty of reason.
\par To demonstrate just how incredible the claims of evolutionists are, let anyone who believes in the creative power of chance events take 
a large barrel. Let them put into it however much material they believe is required to form a living thing. For example, let them include all the needed elements\emdash carbon, phosphorus, calcium\emdash 
as well as organic compounds like amino acids, proteins, lipids, a
nd carotene. Then let them add to this mixture whatever outside influence they choose. For example, heat or chill the barrel. Let it be struck by lightning or apply electric current. Let them stir the mixture with whatever advanced devices they may have. 
I
n addition, let them stand guard on this barrel transferring this responsibility from father to son for millions, even billions, of years. And so as to increase the chances of success, let them control the mixing at every moment. Let them consult with oth
ers;meet with the world's foremost biologists, geneticists, physicists and experts on evolution. Leave them free to produce whatever conditions they deem necessary to originate life.
\par Yet despite all this serious, conscious effort, they'll never be able to produce anything like a living being in that barrel. No matter what they do, they'll never be able to produce the living things pictured in this book.
\par Let those atoms in that barrel perform any reactions they want; never will they begin an "evolution" capab
le of producing brilliant scientists like Einstein and Newton able to solve complex problems; artists like Michelangelo and Picasso able to create masterpieces; musicians like Beethoven and Mozart able to compose melodies to delight the human spirit; disc
o
verers;scientists able to examine under electron microscopes the molecules and atoms out of which they themselves are composed; talented actors like Humphrey Bogart and Charlton Heston; celebrities like Steve Martin, Bon Jovi and Sting. Or consider the ma
n
y artists; those who take pleasure in symmetry, esthetics and harmonious colors; those able to design automobiles and write books; thinkers with faculties of logic and judgment;human beings able to retain in memory what they have learned, share longings, 
feel excitement and pleasure;who are possessed with a sense of love, mercy and compassion; who enjoy the taste of food and whose appetite is stimulated by a cake baking in the oven; who laugh at something funny and enjoy being with their}{

\par Bring unconscious atoms together in whatever way you prefer. Never will they be able to bring about a single one of these living things, or even one of their cells.
\par If so\emdash if no living thing can ever be produced by human effort and the whole pool of human knowledge\emdash 
how can life be brought into being with the aid of unconscious atoms and chance events? Any intelligent human being of conscience can certainly understand that he\emdash and other living things\emdash cannot be the result
 of chance events. Every intelligent, unprejudiced person with a conscience knows that God has created all these living things with His incomparable power.
\par Regrettably, a segment of the population has accepted this irrational scenario throughout the 20th c
entury. Professors, scientists and teachers may ridicule the "primitive" beliefs of pagan societies, while themselves accepting the nonsense of evolution. In this, they're equally as benighted as those human beings who expect a wooden idol can help them. 
God's Messenger, he Prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him, also reminded anyone afflicted with such blindness that the greatest sin is associating His creatures with God:

were to gather together and spend years using the world's newest and most advanced technology, try as they might, never would they be able to produce a 
single pea. They couldn't originate even one of the single cells that make up a pea. This is one of the most important points that evolutionists ignore: It is God, the Lord of the Worlds, Who has created everything from nothing.

\par Or can we suppose that the ancestors of these living things gained experience over the course of th

ilar to the act of radar in the air, the huge mammals send out sound waves to a certain point. The returning waves are analyzed and interpreted in the animal's brain, giving it a clear "picture" of the kind of object it is encountering, along with its siz

\par Along with determining the right way to swim, these creatures also use sound waves for communication. Two whales, kilometers apart, can understand each other, using sound. 
\par It's still not completely understood how these animals produce the sounds to communicate and find their way. But the structure of a dolphin's head is known t

\par The self-sacrifice that animals demonstrate is one of the main problems that Darwinism encounters. Darwinism claims that nature is a merciless struggle in which the strong crush the weak, yet ani
mals display many kinds of behavior that disproves this claim. Some animals feed each other and protect each other from danger; they clean and groom one another and prepare nests for their young. Sometimes they will even sacrifice their lives for one anot
her. (A honeybee, for example, will sting an intruder to defend her hive, even though the act of stinging effectively disembowels the bee and results in her death.) For evolutionists, this is a major problem. As Darwin says,
\par So wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory.21
\par 
\par One evolutionist publication describes the trouble caused by such instances of self-sacrifice: 
\par The problem is why living things help one another. According to Darwin's theory, every creature is engaged in a struggle to reproduce and continue its own existence. Since helping another would decrease the possibility of that creature's well-being, evolu
tion would have to eliminate this behavior over a long period. However, it has been observed that creatures can sacrifice themselves.22

that every one of their brains, intelligence, cognitive faculties, judgment, memory, physical characteristics and thousands of other qualities have been formed by chance. According to Darwinists, a cell that the world's most intelligence scientists could

ot produce with the highest technology could arise by the chance interaction of unconscious atoms. Moreover, such chance events have been able to produce geniuses like Einstein, Pasteur, Galileo and Newton. Certainly, these claims are beyond all sense. Th

The theory of evolution, with its claim that time, chance and mud combined to form a "creative god" is reminiscent of the various creation myths of uncivilized and unscientific societies. Anyone who uses his mind logically, with no ideological prejudice, 
will easily understand that it is untenable. 
\par As we have pointed out from the outset, those who accept the theory of evolution believe in chance events that have been subtly operating since the beginning of the world; and that with the help of time, thinkin
g, intelligent research professors, university students, scientists like Einstein and Hubble, actors like Frank Sinatra and Charlton Heston, as well as gazelles, lemon trees and carnations all came to be from "some warm little pond" in Darwin's words.27 A
nd those who believe this nonsense include scientists, professors, and other cultured, educated people. 
\par For this reason, it is appropriate to designate the theory of evolution as one of the strongest spells ever cast over the world. Throughout modern histo
ry, few ideas have so bewitched people. It's as if this theory has pulled a curtain over their eyes, preventing them from seeing evident facts and, based on those facts, thinking logically and intelligently. This blindness is more serious and incomprehens
i
ble than the ancient Egyptians' belief in the Sun God Ra, the totems of some African tribes, the sun worship of the Sabians, the hand-made idols of the people of Abraham, the worship of the Golden Calf by the children of Israel, and the Christians' belief
 in the trinity. About such people, the Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) said the following: "It is not someone without eyes who is blind but someone without understanding."28 
\par This is the lack of intelligence that God points out in the Qur'an; in several verses, He says that some people will have their judgment clouded and fall into such a wretched state as to be unable to see the truth. Some of these verses read as follows:

\par That this s
pell has such a wide effect on the world, that it has been able to keep so many people so removed from the truth without being broken for 150 years is too amazing for words to express. Yes, it's understandable that one or two people could believe in impos
s
ible propositions, in nonsensical claims. But it seems wholly preposterous for people all over the world to believe that lifeless, unconscious atoms suddenly decided to come together, abruptly display extraordinary organization, discipline and conscious i
ntelligence and, operating flawlessly, produce the universe, planet Earth with all its life-sustaining qualities, and living things endowed with their innumerable and complex systems.
\par In the Qur'an (7: 116), God tells of an episode that occurred between Mos
es (peace be upon Him) and Pharaoh, showing how some people who espoused a godless philosophy put spells on others. When Moses was explaining the true religion to Pharaoh, Pharaoh told Moses to meet him where his skilled magicians were gathered with the p
eople. When Moses met the magicians, he commanded them to display their skills, and: 
\par He said, "You throw." And when they threw, they cast a spell on the people's eyes and caused them to feel great fear of them. They produced an extremely powerful magic. 
\par Pharaoh's magicians were able to put a deceptive spell on everyone\emdash 
except Moses and those who believed in him. But the proof that Moses presented to them in response "swallowed up what they had forged" as it says in this verse, in other words, made them ineffective:
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266 
\par }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid14509266 
We revealed to Moses, "Throw down your staff." And it immediately swallowed up what they [the magicians] had forged. So the Truth took place and what they did was shown to be false. They were defeated then and there, transformed into humbled men
. (Qur'an 7: 116)
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266 
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 
As this verse states, when these people understood that the spell put on others was unreal, they were humiliated. If those who are under a spell today, dedicating their lives to defending claims presented under a scientific guise, do not
 give up their nonsense, they too will be humiliated when all the evidence for the truth comes out and the spell is broken. Malcolm Muggeridge, the atheist philosopher and supporter of evolution, confesses his uneasiness in this regard: 
\par I myself am convin
ced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it's been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books in the future. Posterity will marvel that so very flimsly and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with the incredib
le credulity that it has. 29
\par This day is not far off\emdash in fact, it's quite near\emdash when people will understand that chance is not a god, and realize that the theory of evolution has been the biggest deception casting a most powerful spell. But this spell has beg
un to be lifted very quickly from people all over the globe: Many individuals who have learned the secret of evolution's deception are amazed how they could have been taken in.

\par Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was in
v
alidated by the scientific evidence of clear "design" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of 
evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.
\par Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in 
the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated b
y
 a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the o
rigin of life. This 
\par "intelligent design" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.
\par We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are
 still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here.

on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreo
ver, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficu
lties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. 
\par 2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all.

er, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, wit
hout any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology.

s book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living ma
t
erials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on 
a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on m
eat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par Even when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbon
ne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."30
\par For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of sci
ence unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930s, he tried to prove that a l
iving cell could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: 
\par Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the evolution of organisms.31
\par Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve this problem. The best known experiment was carried out by the American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed
 in the primordial Earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins. 
\par Barely a few years had passed before it was revealed that this experiment, which was then presented as an important step in the name of evolution, was invalid, for the atmosphere used in the experiment was very different from the real Earth conditions.32

\par After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic.33
\par All the evolutionists' efforts throughout the twentieth century to explain the origin of life ended in failure. The geochemist Jeffrey Bada, from the San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth magazine in 1998:

\par The
 primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all
 of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to b
e explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is cons
idered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consist
ing of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can
 be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute
 from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine:
\par It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in th
e same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means.35
\par No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was "created" in a supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation.

\par The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means of Natural Selection\'85
\par Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natura
l conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individ
uals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. 
\par Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book The Origin of Species:
\par Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur.36

uestion from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to t
h
e next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their ne
cks were extended from generation to generation.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism add
ed mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in
 the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet
, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any ra
ndom change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all prob
ability, would not be an improvement.38
\par Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which
 is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionar
y
 mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "e
volution" could have taken place.

millions of years. 
\par Had this been the case, numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian trait

\par If such animals ever really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species, Darwin explained:

ing strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the nineteenth century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All of the fossils, contrary to the evolutionists' expectations, show that life appeared on Earth all of a 
sudden and fully-formed. 
\par One famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist:
\par The point emerges that if we examine the fossil record in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find \endash  over and over again \endash  not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another.40
\par This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the 
opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, this is very strong evidence that all living things are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor is that it was created. This
 fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma:
\par Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did no
t. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence.41
\par Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the earth. That means that "the origin of species," contrary to Darwin's supposition, is not evolution, but creation.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 The subject most often brought up by advocates o
f the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. The Darwinist claim holds that modern man evolved from ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, some "transitional
 forms" between modern man and his ancestors are supposed to have existed. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic "categories" are listed:

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 1. Australopithecus 
\par 2. Homo habilis
\par 3. Homo erectus
\par 4. Homo sapiens
\par Evolutionists call man's 
so-called first ape-like ancestors Australopithecus, which means "South African ape." These living beings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famou
s anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, shows that these apes belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans.42
\par Evolutionists classify the next stage of human e
volution as "homo," that is "man." According to their claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular 
o
rder. This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the twentieth century's most important evolutionists, contends in his book One Long Argument that "p
articularly historical [puzzles] such as the origin of life or of Homo sapiens, are extremely difficult and may even resist a final, satisfying explanation."43
\par By outlining the link chain as Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens, evo
lutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.44
\par Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co-existed in the same region.45
\par This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another. A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution, although he is an evolutionist himself:

\par What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting l
ineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? Moreover, none of the three display any evolutionary trends during their tenure on earth.46
\par Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, 
which is "upheld" with the help of various drawings of some "half ape, half human" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific foundation. 
\par Lord Solly Zuckerman, one 
of the most famous and respected scientists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years and studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in fact, no such family
 tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man. 
\par Zuckerman also made an interesting "spectrum of science" ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most "scientific"\emdash that is, depending on concrete data\emdash 
fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most "unscientific," are "extra-sensory perception"\emdash 
concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense\emdash and finally "human evolution." Zuckerman explains his reasoning:
\par We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of presumed biological science, like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man's fossil history, where to the faithful [evolutionist] anything is possible \endash 
 and where the ardent believer [in evolution] is sometimes able to believe several contradictory things at the same time.47
\par The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory.

\par Before passing on
 to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of 
the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is complet
ely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image
 formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around
 
you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensio
n
al, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. 
A
gain, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional persp
ective with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without put
ting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both t
he camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of ch
ance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?

If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen 
by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and 
the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is 
insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely sile
nt brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imag
ery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and t
h
e thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest compa
n
y in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are ex
tremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

\par }{\b0\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 The information we have presented so far shows us that the 
theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required int
e
rmediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throug
hout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some ci
rcles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":
\par It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us
 accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how c
ounter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.48
\par These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to mater
ialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whal
e
s, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so
 as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Cr
eator is God, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.

\par Many people think that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a proven fact. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, recent developments in science completely disprove the 
theory. This book clarifies the scientific collapse of the theory of evolution in a way that is detailed but easy to understand.}{\f0\fs22\insrsid5406424  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 
Anyone who wants to learn about the origin of living things, including mankind, needs to read this book. 
\par 
\par How was matter and t
ime created from nothingness? What does the Big Bang theory signify about the creation of the universe? What is the parallelism between Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the Qur'anic verses? All of these questions are answered in this book. If you want 
to learn the truths about space, matter, time and fate, read this book. 
\par 
\par Today, science has proven that the universe was created from nothing with a Big Bang. Everything from the nuclear reactions in stars to the chemical properties of a carbon atom or a w
ater molecule, is created in a glorious harmony. This is the exalted and flawless creation of God. 
\par 
\par Fascism and communism, which made humanity suffer dark times, are fed from the same source, on the grounds of which they can attract masses to their side. 
This source is the materialist philosophy and its adaptation to nature, which is Darwinism. The acknowledgement of the scientific invalidity of this theory will bring about the end of all these detrimental ideologies. 
\par 
\par People who are oppressed, who are tortured to death, those who cannot afford even a loaf of bread, women, children, and old people who are expelled from their homes because of their religion\'85
 Eventually, there is only one solution to the injustice, chaos, hunger, and oppression: the values of the Qur'an. 
\par 
\par This book gets into detail on the issue of origins and makes a comprehensive and technical refutation of Darwinist theory. As it is mentioned in the book, anyone who still defends the theory of evolution has to come into terms with this boo
k and face its challenge. Otherwise, he will de facto accept that his allegiance to the theory of evolution is a non-scientific approach but a materialistic dogma.

examines these penalties as revealed in the verses of the Quran and in light of archaeological discoveries. 
\par Never plead ignorance of God's evident existence, that you will not stay so lo
ng in this world, of the reality of death, that the Qur'an is the Book of truth, that you will give account for your deeds, of the voice of your conscience that always invites you to righteousness.
\par 
\par When you read this book, you will see that Darwin's theor
y has absolutely broken down, just as he feared it would. A thorough examination of the feathers of a bird, or the wing structure of a fly reveal amazingly complex designs. And these designs indicate that they are created flawlessly by God. 
\par 
\par This book is a summons to think. A summons to ponder over the universe and living beings and see how they have been created flawlessly.
\par 
\par The world is a temporary place specially created by G
od to test man. Each and every attraction existing in the world eventually wears out, becomes corrupt, decays and finally disappears. This book leads man to ponder the real place to which he belongs, namely the hereafter.
\par 
\par In this book you will find explanations about eternity, timelessness and spacelessness that you will never have encountered anywhere else and you will be confronted by the reality that eternity has already begun.
\par 
\par Scientific progress makes it clear that living beings have an extremely complex structure and an order that is too perfect to have come into being by accident. In this book, the unique creation of God is once again disclosed for all to see. 
\par 
\par When the events of "sickness" and "recovering" take place, our bodies become a battlegro
und in which a bitter struggle is taking place. The body however has a mechanism that combats them. This system proves that the human body is the outcome of a unique design that has been planned with a great wisdom and skill.
\par 
\par The way to examine the univer
se and all the beings therein and to discover God's art of creation and announce it to humanity is "science." Therefore, religion adopts science as a way to reach the details of God's creation. This book is about this close link between science and religi
on.
\par 
\par Colors, patterns, spots even lines of each living being existing in nature have a meaning. An attentive eye would immediately recognize that not only the living beings, but also everything in nature are just as they should be.
\par 
\par The plan, design, and de
licate balance existing in our bodies and reaching into even the remotest corners of the iuniverse must surely have a superior Creator. Man is unable to see his Creator yet he can nevertheless grasp His existence, strength, and wisdom by means of his inte
llect.
\par 
\par Just as a tiny key opens a huge door, this book will open new horizons for its readers. Relating the amazing and admirable features of spiders known by few people, this book reveals the excellence and perfection inherent in God's creation.

ormation hidden inside DNA controls the thousands of different events that take place in the cells of the human body and in the functioning of its systems. In the same way that every book has a writer and owner, so does the information in DNA:and that Cre

\par These millimeter-sized animals have an excellent ability for organization and specialization that is not to be matched by any other being on earth. These aspects of ants create in one a great admiration for God's superior power and unmatched creation.

\par 
\par This book maintains that the source of the scourge of terrorism does not come from a divine religion, and that there is no room for terrorism in Islam.
\par 
\par The content of this book is an extremely important truth: "All events, people, buildings, cities, cars, places, which are
 a part of our life in this world, in short, everything we see, hold, touch, smell, taste and hear, are actually illusions and sensations that form in our brain."
\par 
\par This book reveals what a serious threat romanticism poses to societies and individuals, and shows how easy it is to eliminate this danger.
\par 
\par This book deals with how the theory of evolution is invalidated by scientific findings and experiments in a concise and simple language.
\par 
\par The theory of evolution has been on the agenda for 150 years, deeply a
ffecting numerous peoples' outlook on life. It imposes on them the lie that they are an "animal species" that came into being as a result of coincidences. In this book, commonly asked questions about the theory of evolution and evolutionary claims on thes

\par 
\par This book presents the philosophy of free
masonry, and provides a detailed account of how this philosophy infiltrated first into the West, and then into other civilizations of the world. The main theme can be summed up as "the history of the war that freemasonry waged against religion."
\par 
\par A person who examines any corner of the universe sees a flawless plan incorporating both order and design. Everywhere in the universe there prevails an admirable glory. This glory is the superior and matchless artistry of God, Who creates everything.

\par 
\par In the Qur'an, God tells people many secrets. For people who learn these secrets of the Qur'an, however, the life of this world is very easy, and full of joy and excitement. This book deals with the subjects God related to people as a secret.
\par 
\par God creates every word on
e utters, and every event one experiences, from the moment one is born into tis world. For a believer who understands this fact, uninterrupted joy of faith becomes an unchanging quality of life. The fate decreed by God is flawless. 
\par 
\par God, in the Qur'an, calls the culture of people who are not subject to the religion of God "ignorance." The purpose of this book is to take this comparison further, displaying the extent of the "crude understanding" of ignorant societies.

\par 
\par Are you aware of the beauties that are presented by the Qur'an for human life? Have you ever thought about the benefits a person and society have when they follow the
 commandments of the Qur'an? With this book, you will also recognize the beauties presented by the Qur'an for life. 
\par 
\par A person having fear of God naturally shows mercy for His servants and treats them kindly. Yet it is essential to distinguish between the concept of mercy, as conceived by people of ignorance, and the mercy described in the Qur'an. 
\par 
\par This book gives an insight into some good moral aspects of the Karma philosophy which are in agreement with the Qur'an, as well as its twisted views which confl
ict with human reason and conscience. The book also explains why following God's way and living by the Qur'an is the only way to real happiness, peace, and security.
\par Some religious people think that the theory of evolution is a scientific fact and look for
 a "middle way" between this theory and belief in God. However, in truth, the ideological framework behind the theory consists of anti-religious thought put forward to strengthen atheism. This book is aimed at offering a response to those Muslims who try 
to find common ground between the theory of evolution and the fact of creation, and who even try to find evidence for the theory in the Qur'an.
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid2381889 
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid14509266\charrsid5406424 The main purpose of this book is to fully reveal the plight of oppressed Muslims across the world, and to invite
 people of conscience to think on this reality and look for solutions. The expected spring is, by the will of God, to come soon.
\par 
\par The creation of man, who is endowed with a highly complicated body structure, from a drop of water, comes about through an ext
raordinary course of development. This development certainly does not happen as the result of an idle process, and random coincidences, but is a conscious act of creation. This book is about the details of the "miracle in man's creation." 
\par 
\par Being a true servant of God and conducting one's life in the light of the Qur'an require a sound knowledge of the Qur'an. This book is prepared for those who aim to attain the good pleasure, mercy, and Paradise of God. 
\par 
\par This book maintains that only love, tolerance and peace can eradicate terrorism and reveals, with quotations from the Qur'an, the Gospel and the Torah, that terrorism is a form of savagery condemned by all divine religions. With examples from history, the
 book demonstrates that the only way to fight terrorism is to embrace the sentiments fostered by the values of religion, such as love, compassion, forgiveness, tolerance and justice.
\par 
\par The adjective "perfected" (kamil) carries the meaning inclusive, entire and complete. The "perfected faith" discussed in this book represents the highest level of maturity and depth of faith a person can ever attain. 
\par 
\par This book has been prepared to demonstrate that the Qur'an is the word of God, it is a guide and a reminder, i
t addresses everyone in the world, and its pronouncements are valid for all times, right from the time of its revelation. It is therefore the most important source everyone must refer to. For man to be guided to the truth, it is imperative that he know Is
lam and comprehend the verses of the Qur'an.
\par 
\par Man is a being to which God has granted the faculty of thinking. Yet a majority of people fail to employ this faculty as they should\'85 The purpose of this book is to summon people to think in the way they should 
and to guide them in their efforts to think. This book is also available in Indonesian.
\par 
\par In a body that is made up of atoms, you breathe in air, eat food, and drink liquids that are all composed of atoms. In this book, the implausibility of the spontaneous
 formation of an atom, the building-block of everything, living or non-living, is related and the flawless nature of God's creation is demonstrated. 
\par 
\par This book is about sincerity, an important characteristic of believers which makes deeds worthy and meani
ngful in God's sight. Sincerity (ikhlas) is doing everything simply because God ordered it, without expecting any personal benefit in return. In the Qur'an, God gives the good tidings of paradise to His sincere servants. 
\par 
\par Communism is an ideology that has
 caused the death of some 100 million people and brought oppression, persecution, blood and tears to many countries. So, where was communism born, how did it grow, and how did it come to an end? This book provides answers to these questions and draws atte
ntion to a grave menace. Well, has that menace disappeared now? Sadly, not: COMMUNISM WAITS IN AMBUSH! 
\par 
\par Communist persecution has been on the rise in all corners of China for half a century. The worst-suffering victims of this persecution are the Muslims o
f Eastern Turkestan. As you will also see in this book, the basic reason behind Chinese oppression is the materialist philosophy and communist ideology pervading the state.
\par 
\par Man places his hope in Allah in relation to the degree of his faith. He hopes to attain the favors promised to him to the extent of his trust, closeness, submission and sincerity to Allah. These are actually the people who earn the approval of Allah. 

\par 
\par Surah Yusuf of the Qur'an is almost entirely about the life of the Prophet Yusuf (pbu
h) and his family. In this book, you will read about the life of the Prophet Yusuf (pbuh), who went through various difficulties since his childhood and was later given to the control of the treasures of Egypt, in the light of Qur'anic verses and striking
 explanations. 
\par 
\par Most people conceive of Paradise as a surreal and abstract notion. The most important reason for this misconception is an insufficient knowledge of the Qur'an and a lack of understanding. This book provides a realistic description of Paradi
se as related in the Qur'an and summons man to think about this eternal abode. 
\par 
\par This book, which offers definitive solutions to the question of Palestine, is also a call to the Israelis, who are from the People of the Book. Another point highlighted in th
e book is that the solution to the Palestinian question and many other such disputes lies in bringing love, compassion and peace to the world.
