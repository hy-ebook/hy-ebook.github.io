The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related
 and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the forgery of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies. 
\par 
\par His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author\rquote 
s books has a symbolic meaning linked to their contents. This seal represents the Qu
r'an as the last Book by God and the last word of Him and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of disbelieving ideologies a
nd to say the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par 
\par All these works by the 
author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to people and thus to encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to remind them of some important issues. 

\par 
\par Har
un Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries such as India, America, England, Indonesia, Poland, Bosnia, Spain and Brazil. His books have been translated into many languages, and English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian,
 Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian versions are available. 
\par 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into 
their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid effe
c
tiveness, definite results and irrefutability. The explanations provided in the books are undeniable, explicit and sincere, and enrich the reader with definitive answers. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious thought to them ca
n
 any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this proves to be only a sentimental insistence since these books refute these ideologies from their ve
ry basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par 
\par There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity endowed them by God. The author certainly 
does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, the author makes no material gains from his books. Neither the writer, nor those who are instrumental in publishing and making these b
ooks accessible to the reader, make any material gains. They merely serve to earn the good pleasure of God. 
\par 
\par Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate books which create confusion in people's minds, lead people into ideological chaos, and which clearly have no strong and precise effects in
 removing the doubts in peoples' hearts. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to put the stress on author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this 
can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has rendered are manifest in the reader's conviction. 
\par 
\par One point needs to be
 kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals Muslims undergo is the ideological prevalence of lack of religion. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of lack of faith and by ensurin
g
 that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this se
rvice has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par 
\par It is no exaggeration to say that the Harun Yahya series have assume
d this leading role. By the Will of God, these books will be the means through which people in the 21st century will attain the peace and bliss, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

people who have heard of "the theory of evolution" or "Darwinism", may think that these concepts only concern the field of biology and that they have no significance in their everyday lives. This is a big misconception because far more than a biological c
oncept, the theory of evolution constitutes the underpinnings of a dishonest philosophy that has held sway over a great number of people. 
\par That philosophy is }{\b\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 "materialism"}{\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 , which holds a number of bogus views about why and how we came into being. Materialis
m maintains that there is nothing but the matter and that matter is the essence of everything, be it organic or inorganic. Starting out from this premise, }{\b\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
it denies the existence of a divine Creator, that is, Allah.}{\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  Reducing everything to the level of matt
er, this notion transforms man into a creature that heeds only matter and turns away from moral values of whatever kind. This is the beginning of big disasters that will befall a man's life. 
\par The detriments of materialism are not only limited to individuals. Materialism also seeks to }{\b\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 abolish the basic values on which the state and society rest }{\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
and generate a soulless and insensitive society that pays attention only to matter. Since the members of such a society can never possess idealistic notions such as l
ove for one's people, justice, loyalty, honesty, self-sacrifice, honour, or good morals, the social order established by these individuals is doomed to be shattered in a short while. For these reasons, materialism is one of the severest menaces to the bas
ic values of the political and social order of a nation.
\par The theory of evolution also constitutes the so-called scientific foundation of materialism that the communist ideology depends on. By taking the theory of evolution as a reference, communism seeks to
 justify itself and to present its ideology as sound and correct. This is why the founder of communism, Karl Marx, wrote for Darwin's book, }{\i\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid156471 The Origin of Species}{\fs22\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380

\par In point of fact, materialist notions of every kind, Marx's ideas being foremost among them, have utterly collapsed for the reason that the theo
ry of evolution, which is in fact a 19th century dogma on which materialism rests, has been absolutely invalidated by the findings of modern science. Science has disproved and continues to disprove the materialist hypothesis that recognises the existence 
of nothing but matter and it demonstrates that all beings are the products of creation by a superior being. 
\par The purpose of this book is to reveal the scientific facts that refute the theory of evolution in all fields and to inform people about the ulterior, underlying, and real purpose of this so-called "science", which is in fact a fraud.
\par It should be pointed out that evolutionists have no answer to give to the book you are now reading. And they will not even attempt to answer it for they are aware that su

The theory of evolution is the outcome of the materialist philosophy that surfaced with the reawakening of ancient Sumerian and Greek materialistic myths and became widespread in the 19th century. Materialism seeks to explain nature through purely materia
l
 factors. Since it denies creation right from the start, it asserts that every thing, whether animate or inanimate, has appeared without an act of creation but rather as a result of a coincidence that then acquired a condition of order. The human mind how
e
ver is so structured as to comprehend the existence of an organising will wherever it sees order. Materialistic philosophy, which is contrary to this very basic characteristic of the human mind, produced "the theory of evolution" in the middle of the 19th
 century.

\par }{\b\caps\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Darwin's Imagination 
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The person who put forward the theory of evolution the way it is defended today, was an amateur English naturalist, Charles Robert Darwin. 
\par Darwin had never undergone a formal education in biology. He took only an amateur i
nterest in the subject of nature and living things. His interest spurred him to voluntarily join an expedition on board a ship named H.M.S. Beagle that set out from England in 1832 and travelled around different regions of the world for five years. Young 
D
arwin was greatly impressed by various living species, especially by certain finches that he saw in the Galapagos Islands. He thought that the variations in their beaks were caused by their adaptation to their habitat. With this idea in mind, he supposed 
t
hat the origin of life and species lay in the concept of "adaptation to the environment". According to Darwin, different living species were not created separately by Allah but rather came from a common ancestor and became differentiated from each other a
s a result of natural forces. 
\par Darwin called this process}{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  "evolution by natural selection"}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
. He thought he had found the "origin of species": the origin of one species was another species. He published these views in his book titled }{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The Origin of Species, By Means of Natural Selection}{
\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  in 1859. 
\par Darwin was well aware that his theory faced lots of problems. He confessed these in his book in the chapter}{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  "Difficulties of the Theory"}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
. These difficulties primarily consisted of the fossil re
cord, complex organs of living things that could not possibly be explained by coincidence (e.g. the eye), and the instincts of living beings. Darwin hoped that these difficulties would be overcome by new discoveries; yet this did not stop him from coming 
up with a number of very inadequate explanations for some. The American physicist Lipson made the following comment on the "difficulties" of Darwin:
\par On reading The Origin of Species, I found that Darwin was much less sure himself than he is often represente
d to be; the chapter entitled "Difficulties of the Theory" for example, shows considerable self-doubt. As a physicist, I was particularly intrigued by his comments on how the eye would have arisen.}{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {

arck, living creatures passed the traits they acquired during their lifetime from one generation to the next and thus evolved. For instance, giraffes evolved from antelope-like animals by extending their necks further and further from generation to genera
tion as they tried to reach higher and higher branches for food. Darwin thus employed the thesis of "passing the acquired traits" proposed by Lamarck as the factor that made living beings evolve.}{\f38\fs18\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 But both Darwin and Lamarck were mistaken because in their da
y, life could only be studied with very primitive technology and at a very inadequate level. Scientific fields such as genetics and biochemistry did not exist even in name. Their theories therefore had to depend entirely on their powers of imagination. 

\par While the echoes of Darwin's book reverberated, an Austrian botanist by the name of }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Gregor Mendel}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
 discovered the laws of inheritance in 1865. Not much heard of until the end of the century, Mendel's discovery gained great importance in the early 1900s. This 
was the birth of the science of genetics. Somewhat later, the structure of the genes and the chromosomes was discovered. The discovery, in the 1950s, of the DNA molecule that incorporates genetic information threw the theory of evolution into a great cris
is. The reason was the incredible complexity of life and the invalidity of the evolutionary mechanisms proposed by Darwin. 
\par 
\par }{\b\caps\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The Desperate Efforts of Neo-Darwinism
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Darwin's theory entered into a deep crisis because of the laws of genetics discovered in the 
first quarter of the 20th century. Nevertheless, a group of scientists who were determined to remain loyal to Darwin endeavoured to come up with solutions. 
\par This cadre focused on the question }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 of the origin of the advantageous variations that supposedly caused living organisms to evolve}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
-an issue that Darwin himself was unable to explain but simply tried to side-step by depending on Lamarck. The idea was now "random mutations". They named this new theory }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
"The Modern Synthetic Evolution Theory",}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  which was form
ulated by adding the concept of mutation to Darwin's natural selection thesis. In a short time, this theory came to be known as "neo-Darwinism" and those who put forward the theory were called "neo-Darwinists".
\par The following decades were to become an era of desperate attempts to prove neo-Darwinism. It was already known that mutations-or "accidents"-that took place in the genes of living organisms were always harmful. }{
\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Neo-Darwinists}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  tried to establish a case for "advantageous mutation" by carrying out thousands of }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 mutation}{
\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  experiments. All their attempts ended in complete failure. 
\par They also tried to prove that the first living organisms could have originated by chance under primitive terrestrial conditions that the theory posited but the same failure attend
ed these experiments too. Every experiment that sought to prove that life could be generated by chance failed. Probability calculations prove that not even a single protein, the building-blocks of life, could have originated by chance. And the cell-which 
supposedly emerged by chance under primitive and uncontrolled terrestrial conditions according to the evolutionists-could not be synthesised by even the most sophisticated laboratories of the 20th century.
\par Neo-Darwinist theory is also defeated by }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 the fossil record}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
. No "transitional forms", which were supposed to show the gradual evolution of living organisms from primitive to advanced species as the neo-Darwinist theory claimed, have ever been found anywhere in the world. At the same time, comparative anatom
y revealed that species that were supposed to have evolved from one another had in fact very different anatomical features and that they could never have been ancestors or descendants of each other.
\par But neo-Darwinism was never a scientific theory anyway, b
ut was an ideological dogma if not to say some sort of "religion". This is why the champions of the theory of evolution still go on defending it in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. One thing they cannot agree on however is which of the different
 models proposed for the realisation of evolution is the "right" one. One of the most important of these models is the fantastic scenario known as "punctuated equilibrium".
\par 
\par }{\b\caps\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Trial and Error: Punctuated Equilibrium
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Most of the scientists who believe in evolu
tion accept the neo-Darwinist theory of slow, gradual evolution. In recent decades, however, a different model has been proposed. Called "punctuated equilibrium", this model rejects the Darwinist idea of a cumulative, step-by-step evolution and holds that
 evolution took place instead in big, discontinuous "jumps".
\par The first vociferous defenders of this notion appeared at the beginning of the 1970s. Two American paleontologists, }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould,}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
 were well aware that the claims of the neo-Darwinist theory were absolutely refuted by the fossil record. Fossils proved that living organisms did not originate by gradual evolution, but appeared suddenly and fully-formed. Neo-Darwinists were living with
 
the fond hope-they still do-that the lost transitional forms would one day be found. Realising that this hope was groundless, Eldredge and Gould were nevertheless unable to abandon their evolutionary dogma, so they put forward a new model: punctuated equi
librium. This is the claim that evolution did not take place as a result of minor variations but rather in sudden and great changes.
\par This model was nothing but a model for fantasies. For instance, European paleontologist O.H. Shindewolf, who led the way for
 Eldredge and Gould, claimed that the first bird came out of a reptile egg, as a "gross mutation", that is, as a result of a huge "accident" that took place in the genetic structure.}{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380

According to the same theory, some land-dwelling animals could have turned into giant whales having undergone a sudden and comprehensive transformation. These claims, totally contradicting all the rules of genetics, biophysics, and biochemistry are as s
cientific as the fairy tales about frogs turning into princes! Nevertheless, being distressed by the crisis that the neo-Darwinist assertion was in, some evolutionist paleontologists embraced this theory, which had the distinction of being even more bizar
re than neo-Darwinism itself. 
\par The only purpose of this model was to provide an explanation of the gaps in the fossil-record that the neo-Darwinist model could not explain. However, it is hardly rational to attempt to explain the fossil gap in the evolution of birds with a claim that }
{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 "a bird popped all of a sudden out of a reptile egg"}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
, because by the evolutionists' own admission, the evolution of a species to another species requires a great and advantageous change in genetic information. However, no mutati
on whatsoever improves the genetic information or adds new information to it. Mutations only derange genetic information. Thus the "gross mutations" imagined by the punctuated equilibrium model would only cause "gross", that is "great", reductions and imp
airments in the genetic information.
\par Moreover, the model of "punctuated equilibrium" collapses from the very first step by its inability to address the question of the origin of life, which is also the question that refutes the neo-Darwinist model from the 
outset. Since not even a single protein can have originated by chance, the debate over whether organisms made up of trillions of those proteins have undergone a "punctuated" or "gradual" evolution is senseless. 
\par In spite of this, the model that comes to mi
nd when "evolution" is at issue today is still neo-Darwinism. In the chapters that follow, we will first examine two imaginary mechanisms of the neo-Darwinist model and then look at the fossil record to test this model. After that, we will dwell upon the 
question of the origin of life, which invalidates both the neo-Darwinist model and all other evolutionist models such as "evolution by leaps".

ream" theory of evolution today, argues that life has evolved through two naturalistic mechanisms: "natural selection" and "mutation". The basic assertion of the theory is as follows: Natural selection and mutation are two complementary mechanisms. The or
igin of evolutionary modifications is random mutations that take place in the genetic structure of living things. The traits brought about by the mutations are selected by the mechanism of natural selection and therefore the living things evolve.
\par When we further probe into this theory, we find that there is no such evolutionary mechanism at all, because neither natural selection nor mutations make any contribution to the claim that different species have evolved and transformed into one another.

As process of nature, natural selection was familiar to biologists before Darwin, who defined it as a "mechanism that keeps species unchanging without being corrupted". Darwin was the first person to put forward the assertion that this pr
ocess had evolutionary power and he then erected his entire theory on the foundation of this assertion. The name he gave to his book indicates that natural selection was the basis of Darwin's theory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection...

\par However since Darwin's time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put forward to show that natural selection causes living beings to evolve. Colin Patterson, the senior paleontologist of the Museum of Natural History in England, who is also a pro
minent evolutionist by the way, stresses that natural selection has never been observed to have the power to cause things to evolve:

Natural selection holds that those living things that are more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will prevail by 
having offspring that will survive, whereas those that are unfit will disappear. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of wild animals, naturally those that can run faster will survive. That is true. But no matter how long this process goes on, it 
will not transform those deer into another living species. The deer will always remain deer.

\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 In 1986 Douglas Futuyma published a book, }{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid156471 The Biology of Evolution}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
, which is accepted as one of the sources explaining the theory of evolution by natural selection in the most explicit way. The most famous of his examples
 on this subject is about the colour of the moth population, which appeared to darken during the Industrial Revolution in England. 
\par According to the account, around the outset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the colour of the tree barks around Man
chester was quite light. Because of this, dark-coloured moths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed on them and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years later, as a result of pollution, the barks of the
 
trees had darkened, and this time the light-coloured moths became the most hunted. As a result, the number of light-coloured moths decreased whereas that of the dark-coloured ones increased since the latter were not easily noticed. Evolutionists use this 
as a great evidence to their theory. Evolutionists, on the other hand, take refuge and solace in window-dressing by showing how light-coloured moths "evolved" into dark-coloured ones.
\par However, it should be quite clear that this situation can in no way be us
ed as evidence for the theory of evolution, for natural selection did not give rise to a new form that had not existed before. Dark coloured moths existed in the moth population before the Industrial Revolution. Only the relative proportions of the existi
n
g moth varieties in the population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or an organ, which would cause a "speciation". In order to have a moth turn into another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have had to be made to the 
genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program would have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical traits of the bird.
\par Briefly, natural selection does not have the capability to add a new organ to a living organism, remove one,
 or change the organism into another species-quite contrary to the image that evolutionists conjure up. The "greatest" evidence put forward since Darwin has been able to go no further than the "industrial melanism" of the moths in England.

Another of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of natural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as a conscious designer. However, natural selection has no consciousness. It does not possess
 a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for living beings. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological systems and organs that have the feature of "irreducible complexity". These systems and organs are composed of the co-operatio

The same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human beings have deleterious results. On this issue, evolutionists throw up a smokescreen and try to 
show even examples of such deleterious mutation as "evidence for evolution". All mutations that take place in humans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, Down syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. These mutations are present

\par *}{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The direct effect of mutations is harmful: }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Since they occur randomly, they almost always damage the living organism tha
t undergoes them. Reason tells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure will not improve that structure but impair it. Indeed, no "useful mutation" has ever been observed.
\par * }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Mutations add no new information to an organism's DNA: }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
The particles making up the genetic information are either torn from their places, destroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause abnormalities like a leg sticking ou
t of the back, or an ear from the abdomen.
\par * }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, it has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
A random change that occurs in a casual cell or organ of the body cannot be transferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the effects of radiation or by other causes will not be passed on to subsequent generations.
\par }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 * Briefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there exists no mechanism in nature that can cause them to evolve. }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380

According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously-existing species turned into something else in time and all species have come into being in this way. According to the theory, this transformation proce
eds gradually over millions of years. 
\par If this was the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquire
d some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creature
s, which they believe to have lived in the past, as "transitional forms". 
\par If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be prese
nt in the fossil record. The number of these transitional forms should have been even greater than the present animal species and their remains should be found all over the world. In The Origin of Species, Darwin explained:

When terrestrial strata and the fossil record are examined, it is to be seen that all living organisms appeared simultaneously. The oldest stratum of the earth in which fossils of living creatures have been found is that of the Cambrian, which has 
an estimated age of 500-550 million years. 
\par The living creatures found in the strata belonging to the Cambrian period emerged all of a sudden in the fossil record-there are no pre-existing ancestors. The fossils found in the Cambrian rocks belonged to snai
ls, trilobites, sponges, earthworms, jellyfish, sea hedgehogs, and other complex invertebrates. This wide mosaic of living organisms made up of such a great number of complex creatures emerged so suddenly that this miraculous event is referred to as the "
Cambrian Explosion" in geological literature. 
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid8458845 Most of the life forms found in this strata have complex systems like eyes, gills, circulatory system, and advanced physiological structures no different from their modern counterparts. For instance, the double

Until about fifty years ago, evolutionists thought that such a creature indeed existed. This fish, called a Coelacanth, which
 was estimated to be 410 million years of age, was put forward as a transitional form with a primitive lung, a developed brain, a digestive and a circulatory system ready to function on land, and even a primitive walking mechanism. These anatomical interp
retations were accepted as undisputed truth among scientific circles until the end of the 1930's. The Coelacanth was presented as a genuine transitional form that proved the evolutionary transition from water to land. 
\par However on December 22, 1938, a very i
nteresting discovery was made in the Indian Ocean. A living member of the Coelacanth family, previously presented as a transitional form that had become extinct seventy million years ago, was caught! The discovery of a "living" prototype of Coelacanth und
oubtedly gave evolutionists a severe shock. The evolutionist paleontologist J.L.B. Smith said that he could not have been more surprised if he had come across a living dinosaur.}{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380

According to the theory of evolution, life originated and evolved in the sea and then was transported onto land by amphibians. This evolutionary scenario also suggests that amphibians evolved into reptiles, creatures living only on land. This scenario is 
a
gain implausible, due to the enormous structural differences between these two classes of animals. For instance, the amphibian egg is designed for developing in water whereas the amniotic egg is designed for developing on land. A "step by step" evolution 
o
f an amphibian is out of the question, because without a perfect and fully-designed egg, it is not possible for a species to survive. Moreover, as usual, there is no evidence of transitional forms that were supposed to link amphibians with reptiles. Evolu

which are the exceptional traits of birds, are a great impasse for the evolutionists. One of the Turkish evolutionists, Engin Korur, confesses the impossibility of the evolution of wings:

\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid10575179\charrsid9903380 The question of how the perfect structure of wings came into being as a result of consecutive haphazard mutations remains completely unanswered. There is no way to explain how the front arms of 
a reptile could have changed into perfectly functioning wings as a result of a distortion in its genes (mutation). 
\par Moreover, just having wings is not sufficient for a land organism to fly. Land-dwelling organisms are devoid of many other structural mechan
isms that birds use for flying. For example, the bones of birds are much lighter than those of land-dwelling organisms. Their lungs function in a very different way. They have a different muscular and skeletal system and a very specialised heart-circulato
r
y system. These features are pre-requisites of flying needed at least as much as wings. All these mechanisms had to exist at the same time and altogether; they could not have formed gradually by being "accumulated". This is why the theory asserting that l
and organisms evolved into aerial organisms is completely fallacious.
\par All of these bring another question to the mind: even if we suppose this impossible story to be true, then why are the evolutionists unable to find any "half-winged" or "single-winged" fossils to back up their story?}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid10575179

of evolution, which claims that birds evolved from reptiles, is unable to explain the huge differences between these two different living classes. In terms of such features as their skeleton structure, lung systems, and warm-blooded metabolism, birds are 
very different from reptiles.
\par Another trait that poses an insurmountable gap between birds and reptiles is the feathers of birds which have a form entirely peculiar to them.
\par The bodies of reptiles are covered with scales, whereas the bodies of birds are cov
ered with feathers. Since evolutionists consider reptiles the ancestor of birds, they are obliged to claim that bird feathers have evolved from reptile scales. However, there is no similarity between scales and feathers. A professor of physiology and neur
o
biology from the University of Connecticut, A.H. Brush, accepts this reality although he is an evolutionist: "Every feature from gene structure and organization, to development, morphogenesis and tissue organization is different (in feathers and scales). 
" 1 Moreover, Prof. Brush examines the protein structure of bird feathers and argues that it is "unique among vertebrates". 2
\par There is no fossil evidence to prove that bird feathers evolved from reptile scales. On the contrary, "feathers appear suddenly in 
the fossil record, as an 'undeniably unique' character distinguishing birds" as Prof. Brush states. 3 Besides, in reptiles, no epidermal structure has yet been detected that pro-vides an origin for bird feathers. 4
\par In 1996, paleontologists made abuzz about fossils of a so called feathered dinosaur, called Sinosauropteryx. However, in 1997, it was revealed that these fossils had nothing to do with birds and that they were not modern feathers. 5
\par On the other hand, when we examine bird feathers closely, we com
e across a very complex design that cannot be explained by any evolutionary process. The famous ornithologist Alan Feduccia states that "every feature of them has aerodynamic functions. They are extremely light, have the ability to lift up which increases
 in lower speeds, and may return to their previous position very easily". Then he continues, "I cannot really
\par understand how an organ perfectly designed for flight may have emerged for another need at the beginning". 6
\par The design of feathers also compelled 
Charles Darwin ponder them. Moreover, the perfect aesthetics of the peafowl's feathers had made him "sick" (his own words). In a letter he wrote to Asa Gray on April 3, 1860, he said "I remember well the time when the thought of the eye made me cold

\par all over, but I have got over this stage of complaint..." And then continued: "... and now trifling particulars of structure often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a peacock's tail, whenever I gaze at it, makes me sick! " 7}{

\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
As we have stated before, the theory of evolution proposes that some imaginary creatures that came out of the sea transformed into reptiles and that birds formed by the evolution of reptiles. According to the same scenario, reptiles are the ancestors not 
o
nly of birds but also of mammals. However, there are big structural gaps between reptiles, which have scales on their bodies, which are cold-blooded, and which reproduce by laying eggs on the one hand and on the other, mammals, which have fur on their bod
ies, which are warm-blooded, and which reproduce by giving birth to their offspring alive.
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid11031202 An example of the structural barriers between reptiles and mammals is their jaw structure. Mammals' mandibles consist of only one mandibular bone and the teeth are pl
aced on this bone. In reptiles, there are three little bones on both sides of the mandible. Another basic difference is that all mammals have three bones in their middle ear (hammer, anvil, and stirrup). In all reptiles, there is a single bone in the midd
l
e ear. Evolutionists claim that the reptile jaw and reptile middle ear evolved gradually into the mammal jaw and ear. Yet the question of how this change occurred remains unanswered. In particular, the question of how an ear with a single bone evolved int
o
 an ear with three bones and how the process of hearing kept on functioning in the meanwhile can never be explained. Not surprisingly, not a single fossil to link reptiles and mammals is to be found. This is why evolutionist paleontologist Roger Lewin was
 forced to say that }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid11031202 "the transition to the first mammal, which probably happened in just one or, at most, two lineages, is still an enigma"}{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid11031202 .}

All of these demonstrate that all living beings appeared on earth suddenly and fully formed, without any evolutionary process. This is concrete evidence of the fact that they were created. Evolutionists, however, try to interpret the fact that liv

ation, oceans and then lands were filled with living things and finally man was created.

Before going into the details of the myth of human evolution, we need to mention the propaganda method that has convinced the general public of the idea that half-man half-ape creatures once lived in the past. This p
ropaganda method makes use of "reconstructions" made in reference to fossils. Reconstruction can be explained as drawing a picture or constructing a model of a living thing based on a single bone-sometimes only a fragment-that has been unearthed. The "ape
-men" we see in newspapers, magazines, or films are all reconstructions.
\par Since fossils are usually disordered and incomplete, any conjecture based on them is likely to be totally speculative. As a matter of fact, the reconstructions (drawings or models) mad
e by the evolutionists based on the fossil remains are prepared speculatively precisely to validate the evolutionary thesis. An anthropologist from Harvard, David R. Pilbeam stresses this fact when he says "at least in paleoanthropology, data are still so
 sparse that theory heavily influences interpretations. Theories have, in the past, clearly reflected our current ideologies instead of the actual data".}{\field\fldedit{\*\fldinst {\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380

\par At this point, we have to highlight a particular p
oint: reconstructions based on bone remains can only reveal the very general characteristics of the object, since the real distinctive details are soft tissues that quickly vanish in time. Therefore with the speculative interpretation of the soft tissues,
 the reconstructed drawings or models become totally dependent on the imagination of the person producing them. Earnst A. Hooten from Harvard University, explains the situation like this:

\par In 1949, Kenneth Oakle

 years old.

In previous chapters, we saw that there are no mechanisms in nature to lead the living beings to evolve and that living species came into existence not as the result of an evolutionary process, but rather emerged all of a su
dden in their present perfect structure. That is, they were created individually. Therefore, it is obvious that "human evolution", too, is a story that has never taken place. What, then, do the evolutionists propose as the basis for this story?According t
o the claims of the theory of evolution, men and modern apes have common ancestors. These creatures evolved in time and some of them became the apes of today while another group that followed another branch of evolution became the men of today.
\par Evolutionists call the so-called first common ancestors of men and apes "}{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid3701668\charrsid3701668 Australopithecus }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 " which means "South African ape". }{

\par Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as "Homo", that is "man". According to the evolutionist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than }{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid3701668\charrsid3701668 Australopithecus }{
\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 , and not very much different from modern man. The modern man of our day, Homo sapiens, is said to have formed at the latest stage of the evolution of this species.
\par The fact of the matter is that the beings called }{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid3701668\charrsid3701668 Australopithecus }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380  in this imaginary scenario fabricated by evolutionists are in fact apes 
that became extinct, and the beings in the Homo series are members of various human races that lived in the past and then disappeared. Evolutionists arranged various ape and human fossils in an order from the smallest to the biggest in order to form a "hu
man evolution" scheme. Research, however, has demonstrated that these fossils by no means imply an evolutionary process and some of these alleged ancestors of man were real apes whereas some of them were real humans.

a head and skull structure similar to that of modern apes, yet with a smaller cranial capacity. According to the claims of evolutionists, these creatures have a very important feature that authenticates them as the ancestors of men: bipedalism.
\par The movements of apes and men are completely different. Human beings are the only living creatures that move freely about on two feet. Some other animals do have a limited ability to move in this way, but those that do have bent skeletons.

\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The next step in the imaginary human evolution scheme
 is "Homo", that is, the human series. These living beings are humans who are no different from modern men, yet who have some racial differences. Seeking to exaggerate these differences, evolutionists represent these people not as a "race" of modern man b
ut as a different "species". However, as we will soon see, the people in the Homo series are nothing but ordinary human racial types.
\par According to the fanciful scheme of evolutionists, the internal imaginary evolution of the Homo species is as follows: First Homo erectus, then }{\i\fs22\cf1\insrsid3701668\charrsid3701668 Homo sapiens }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
archaic and Neanderthal Man, later Cro-Magnon Man and finally modern man.
\par Despite the claims of evolutionists to the contrary, all the "species" we have enumerated above are nothing but genuine human beings. Let us first examine Homo erectus, who evolutionists refer to as the most primitive human species.
\par The most striking evidence showing that Homo erectus is not a "primitive" species is the fossil of "Turkana Boy", one of the oldest Homo erectus remains. It is estimated t
hat the fossil was of a 12-year-old boy, who would have been 1.83 meters tall in his adolescence. The upright skeletal structure of the fossil is no different from that of modern man. Its tall and slender skeletal structure totally complies with that of t
h
e people living in tropical regions in our day. This fossil is one of the most important pieces of evidence that Homo erectus is simply another specimen of the modern human race. Evolutionist paleontologist Richard Leakey compares Homo erectus and modern 
man as follows:

is the immediate forerunner of contemporary man in the imaginary evolutionary scheme. In fact, evolutionists do not have much to say about these men, as there are only minor differences between 
them and modern men. Some researchers even state that representatives of this race are still living today, and point to the Aborigines in Australia as an example. Like Homo sapiens, the Aborigines also have thick protruding eyebrows, an inward-inclined ma

In previous sections of this book, we have related how the fossil record invalidates the theory of evolution. In point of fact we need not have related any of that, because the theory of evolution collapses long before one gets to any claims about the "ev
olution of species" and the evidence of fossils. The subject that renders the theory meaningless from the very outset is the question of how life first appeared on earth. 
\par When it addresses this question, evolutionary theory claims that life started with a 
cell that formed by chance. According to the scenario, four billion years ago various inorganic chemical compounds underwent a reaction in the primordial earth atmosphere in which the effects of thunderbolts and pressure caused them to form the first livi
ng cell. 
\par The first thing that must be said is that the claim that inorganic materials can come together to form life is an unscientific one that is not verified by any experiment or observation so far. Life only generates from life. Each living cell is for
med by the replication of another cell. No one in the world has ever succeeded in forming a living cell by bringing inorganic materials together, not even in the most advanced laboratories. 
\par The theory of evolution claims that the cell of a living being, w
hich cannot be produced even when all the power of the human intellect, knowledge and technology are brought to bear nevertheless managed to form by chance under primordial earth conditions. In the following pages, we will examine why this claim is contra
ry to the most basic principles of science and reason. }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380

\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 The theory of evolution holds that life started with a cell that formed by chance under primitive earth conditions. Let us therefore examine the 
composition of the cell with simple comparisons in order to show how irrational it is to ascribe the existence of the cell - a structure which still maintains its mystery in many respects, even at a time when we have just set foot in the 21st century - to
 natural phenomena and coincidences.
\par With all its operational systems, systems of communication, transportation and management, a cell is no less complex than any city. It contains power stations producing the energy consumed by the cell, factories manufact
uring the enzymes and hormones essential for life, a databank where all necessary information about all products to be produced is recorded, complex transportation systems and pipelines for carrying raw materials and products from one place to another, ad
v
anced laboratories and refineries for breaking down imported raw materials into their usable parts, and specialised cell membrane proteins for the control of incoming and outgoing materials. These constitute only a small part of this incredibly complex sy
stem.
\par Far from being formed under primitive earth conditions, the cell, which in its composition and mechanisms is so complex, cannot be synthesised in even the most sophisticated laboratories of our day. Even with the use of amino acids, the building block
s of the cell, it is not possible to produce so much as a single organelle of the cell, such as mitochondria or ribosome, much less a whole cell. The first cell claimed to have been produced by evolutionary coincidence is as much a figment of the imaginat
ion and a product of fantasy as the unicorn.

\par Proteins are giant molecules consisting of amino acids arranged in a particular sequence in certain quantities and stru
ctures. These molecules constitute the building blocks of a living cell. The simplest is composed of 50 amino acids; but there are some proteins that are composed of thousands of amino acids. The absence, addition, or replacement of a single amino acid in
 
the structure of a protein in living cells, each of which has a particular function, causes the protein to become a useless molecular heap. Incapable of demonstrating the "accidental formation" of amino acids, the theory of evolution founders on the point
 of the formation of proteins.
\par We can easily demonstrate, with simple probability calculations anybody can understand, that the functional structure of proteins can by no means come about by chance.
\par There a
re twenty different amino acids. If we consider that an average-sized protein molecule is composed of 288 amino acids, there are 10300 different combinations of acids. Of all of these possible sequences, only "one" forms the desired protein molecule. The 
o
ther amino-acid chains are either completely useless or else potentially harmful to living things. In other words, the probability of the coincidental formation of only one protein molecule cited above is "1 in 10300". The probability of this "1" occurrin
g
 out of an "astronomical" number consisting of 1 followed by 300 zeros is for all practical purposes zero; it is impossible. Furthermore, a protein molecule of 288 amino acids is rather a modest one compared with some giant protein molecules consisting of
 thousands of amino acids. When we apply similar probability calculations to these giant protein molecules, we see that even the word "impossible" becomes inadequate.

Since Oparin, evolutionists have performed countless experiments, conducted research, and made observations to prove that a cell could have been formed by chance. However, every such attempt only made clearer the complex design of the cell and t
hus refuted the evolutionists' hypotheses even more. Stanley Miller's experiment of 1953 was once regarded as an evidence for evolution in the molecular level, but after the 1970's, the Miller experiment and similar evolutionary studies lost all their cre
dibility due to the findings about the early athmosphere. It was discovered that the early atmosphere was very unsupportive of the formation of organic molecules.

 the same fact:

The theory of evolution has been unable to provide a coherent explanation for the origin of the molecules that are the basis of the cell. Furthermore, developments in the science of genetics and the discovery of the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA
) have produced brand-new problems for the theory of evolution.
\par In 1955, the work of two scientists on DNA, James Watson and Francis Crick, launched a new era in biology. Many scientists directed their attention to the science of genetics. Today, after yea
rs of research, scientists have largely mapped the structure of DNA.
\par Here, we need to give some very basic information on the structure and function of DNA: 
\par The molecule called DNA, which is found in the nucleus of each of the 100 trillion cells in our bo
dy, contains the complete construction plan of the human body. Information regarding all the characteristics of a person, from the physical appearance to the structure of the inner organs, is recorded in DNA by means of a special coding system. The inform
a
tion in DNA is coded within the sequence of four special bases that make up this molecule. These bases are specified as A, T, G, and C according to the initial letters of their names. All the structural differences among people depend on the variations in
 the sequence of these bases. There are approximately 3.5 billion nucleotides, that is, 3.5 billion letters in a DNA molecule.
\par The DNA data pertaining to a particular organ or protein is included in special components called "genes". For instance, informati
on about the eye exists in a series of special genes, whereas information about the heart exists in quite another series of genes. The cell produces proteins by using the information in all of these genes. Amino acids that constitute the structure of the 
protein are defined by the sequential arrangement of three nucleotides in the DNA.
\par At this point, there is an important detail that deserves attention. An error in the sequence of nucleotides making up a gene would render the gene completely useless. When w
e consider that there are 200 thousand genes in the human body, it becomes more evident how impossible it is for the millions of nucleotides making up these genes to be formed by accident in the right sequence. An evolutionist biologist, Frank Salisbury, 
comments on this impossibility by saying:
\par }\pard \qj \li720\ri0\sbauto1\saauto1\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin720\itap0\pararsid3701668 {\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid3701668 
A medium protein might include about 300 amino acids. The DNA gene controlling this would have about 1,000 nucleotides in its chain. Since there are four kinds of nucleotides in a DNA chain, one consisting of 1,000 
links could exist in 41000 forms. Using a little algebra (logarithms), we can see that 41000=10600. Ten multiplied by itself 600 times gives the figure 1 followed by 600 zeros! This number is completely beyond our comprehension.}

The number 41000 is equivalent to 10600. We obtain this number by adding 600 zeros to 1. As 10 with 11 zeros indicates a trillion, a figure with 600 zeros is indeed a number that is difficult to grasp.

In short, the theory of evolution is unable to prove any of the evolutionary stages that allegedly occur at the molecular level.
\par To summarise what we have
 said so far, neither amino acids nor their products, the proteins making up the cells of living beings, could ever be produced in any so-called "primitive atmosphere" environment. Moreover, factors such as the incredibly complex structure of proteins, th
eir right-hand, left-hand features, and the difficulties in the formation of peptide bonds are just parts of the reason why they will never be produced in any future experiment either.
\par Even if we suppose for a moment that proteins somehow did fo
rm accidentally, that would still have no meaning, for proteins are nothing at all on their own: they cannot themselves reproduce. Protein synthesis is only possible with the information coded in DNA and RNA molecules. Without DNA and RNA, it is impossibl
e
 for a protein to reproduce. The specific sequence of the twenty different amino acids encoded in DNA determines the structure of each protein in the body. However, as has been made abundantly clear by all those who have studied these molecules, it is imp
ossible for DNA and RNA to form by chance.

In the previous chapter, we observed how impossible the coincidental formation of life is. Let us again accept these impossibilities for just a moment. Let u
s suppose that millions of years ago a cell was formed having acquired all the necessities for life and that it "came to life". Evolution again collapses at this point. For even if this cell had subsisted for a while, it would eventually have died and aft
e
r its death, nothing would remain and everything would revert to where it had started. This is because this first living cell, lacking any genetic information, would not have been able to reproduce and start a new generation. Life would have ended with it
s death. 
\par The genetic system is not only comprised of the DNA. The following should also exist in the same environment: enzymes to read the code on the DNA,
 messenger RNA to be produced after reading these codes, a ribosome on which messenger RNA will mount according to this code and clamp to for production, transfer RNA to transfer the amino acids to the ribosome to be used in production, and extremely comp
lex enzymes to carry out numerous intermediary processes. Such an environment cannot exist anywhere else but only in a totally isolated and completely controlled environment like the cell, where all the essential raw materials and energy resources exist. 

\par A
s a result, organic matter can self-reproduce only if it exists as a fully developed cell with all its organelles and in an appropriate environment where it can survive, exchange materials, and get energy from its surroundings. This means that the first c
ell on earth was formed "all of a sudden" with its incredibly complex structure. 
\par }{\b\f38\fs18\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 So, if a complex structure came into existence all of a sudden, what does this mean? }{\f38\fs18\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid9903380 Let us ask this question with an example. Let us resemble the cell to a high-tech car in 
terms of its complexity. (In fact, the cell is comprised of a much more complex and developed system than a car with its motor and all its technical equipment.) Now let us ask: what would you think if you went out trekking in the depths of a thick forest 
a
nd ran across a latest model car among the trees? Would you think that various elements in the forest had come together by chance over millions of years and produced such a vehicle? All the raw materials making up the car are obtained from iron, plastic, 
rubber, earth or its by-products, but would this fact lead you to think that these materials had synthesised "by chance" and then come together and manufactured such a car?
\par Without doubt, anyone with a sound mind would know that the car was the product of a
 conscious design, that is a factory, and wonder what it was doing there in the middle of a jungle. The sudden origination of a complex structure in a complete form out of the blue shows that it is created by a conscious agent. A complex system like the c
ell is no doubt created by a superior will and wisdom. In other words, it came into existence as a creation of Allah. 
\par By believing that pure chance can produce perfect designs, evolutionists cross the bounds of reason and science. One of the outspoken authorities on this issue is the famous French zoologist Pierre Grass\'e9
, the former president of the French Academy of Sciences. Grass\'e9 is a materialist, yet he acknowledges that Darwinist theory is unable to explain life and makes his point about the logic of "coincidence", which is the backbone of Darwinism:

The opportune appearance of mutations permitting animals and plants to meet their needs seems hard to believe. Yet the Darwinian theory is even more demanding: A single plant, a single animal would require
 thousands and thousands of lucky, appropriate events. Thus, miracles would become the rule: events with an infinitesimal probability could not fail to occur\'85 }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid6115067

\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living beings such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxyge

ation we have presented throughout this book shows us that the theory of evolution has no scientific basis and that, on the contrary, the claims of evolution manifestly conflict with scientific discoveries. In other words, the power that sustains evolutio
n is not science. Evolution can be defended by some "scientists", but there must be another fundamental agent at work. 
\par That other agent is materialist philosophy. 
\par So the question becomes one of whether the materialist point of view is correct. A method of
 testing whether a philosophy is true or false is to investigate the claims of that philosophy, which are related to science by using scientific methods. For instance, a philosopher in the 10th century could claim that there was a divine tree on the surfa
c
e of the moon and that all living things actually grew on the branches of this huge tree like fruits and then fell on to earth. Some people might find this philosophy attractive and believe in it. But in the 20th century, at a time when people have manage
d to walk on the moon, it is not possible to put forward such a philosophy. Whether such a tree exists there or not can be determined by scientific methods, that is, by observation and experiment. 
\par }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid6115067 We can therefore investigate by means of scientific methods
 the materialist claim: that is, that matter has existed for all eternity and that this matter can organise itself without a super-material Creator and cause life to begin. When we do this, we see that materialism }{
\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid6115067 has already collapsed, because the idea that matter has always existed since eternity has been overthrown by the Big Bang theory which shows that universe was created from nothingness.}{
\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid6115067  The claim that matter organised itself and brought about life is the claim that we call "the theory of evolution"-the one that this book has been examining and has also shown to have collapsed.}{

The only reason that Darwin's theory is still defended despite its obvious refutation by science is the close link between that theory and materialism. Darwin
\par applied materialist philosophy to the natural sciences and the advocates of this philosophy, Marxists being foremost among them, go on defending
\par Darwinism no matter what. One of the most famous contemporary champions of the theory of evolution, the biologist Douglas Futuyma, wrote: "Together with Marx's materialistic theory of history\'c9
 Darwin's theory of evolution was a crucial plank in the platform of mechanism and materialism. " This is a very clear admission of why the theory of evolution is really so important to its defenders. 
\par 1 Another famous evolutionist, the paleontologist Stephen J.Gould said: "Darwin applied a consistent philosophy of mat
erialism to his interpretation of nature 2 Leon Trotsky , one of the masterminds of the Russian Communist Revolution along with Lenin, commented: "The discovery by Darwin was the highest tri-umph of the dialectic in the whole field of organic matter."3 Ho
wever, science has shown that Darwinism was not a victory for materialism but rather a sign of that philosophy's overthrow.

Lewontin uses here is quite important. This philosophical term refers to a presupposition not based on any experimental knowledge. A thought is "a priori" when you consider it as right and accept it to be so even if there is no information available about
 
the correctness of that thought. As evolutionist Lewontin expresses frankly, materialism is an "a priori" given for evolutionists and they try to adjust science to this given. Since materialism definitely necessitates denying the existence of a Creator, t
hey embrace the only alternative they have in hand, which is the theory of evolution. It does not matter to them that evolution has been belied by scientific facts; such scientists have accepted it "a priori" as correct. 
\par This prejudiced conduct leads evolu
tionists to a belief that "unconscious matter composed itself" which is contrary not only to science but also to reason. Professor of chemistry from New York University and a DNA expert Robert Shapiro, as we have quoted before, explains this belief of evo

Evolutionist propaganda, which we constantly come across in the leading Western media organs and in the famous and "esteemed" science magazines, i

\par }{\b\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380\charrsid6115067 There are scientists who find themselves in a position where they are forced to defend this far-fetched theory or at least avoid uttering any word against it in order to maintain their reputations.}{

domination of this theory. They too are part of the established order regarding evolution as an ideological necessity, for which reason, they blindly defend all the "impossible coincidences" we have been examining so far in this book.
\par When the evolutionist 
literature is browsed, this ideological commitment to evolution can be easily observed. Professor Ali Demirsoy is the famous advocate of the evolutionary theory in Turkey. According to Demirsoy: the probability of the coincidental formation of Cythochrome

The conclusion to be drawn from such pronouncements is that evolution is by no means a theory arrived at through scientific investigation. On the contrary, the form and substance of thi
s theory were dictated by the requirements of materialistic philosophy. It then turned into a belief or dogma in spite of concrete scientific facts. Again, we can clearly see from evolutionist literature that all of this effort indeed has a "purpose". And
 that purpose precludes any belief that all living things were created by a Creator.
\par Evolutionists define this purpose as "scientific". However, what they refer to is not science but materialist philosophy. Materialism absolutely rejects the existence of an
ything "beyond" matter (or of anything supernatural). Science itself is not obliged to accept such a dogma. Science means exploring nature and deriving conclusions from one's findings. If these findings lead to the conclusion that nature is created, scien
ce has to accept it. That is the duty of a true scientist; not defending impossible scenarios by clinging to the outdated materialist dogmas of the 19th century. }{\fs22\cf1\insrsid9903380

steady indoctrination of the society. A part of this indoctrination, possibly the foremost of it, holds that reality is all that can be touched with the hand and seen with the eye. A moment of thought, without being subject to any indoctrination, would ho
wever make one realise an astonishing fact: 
\par From the moment we come into existence, all the things surrounding us are simply what our senses present to us. The world, human beings, animals, flowers, the colours of these flowers, odours, fruits, tastes of f
ruits, planets, stars, mountains, stones, buildings, space, in brief all things are perceptions our senses present us. To further clarify this subject, it will be helpful to talk about the senses, the agents providing information about the exterior world 
to us. 
\par Our perceptions of seeing, hearing, smell, taste and touch, all function similarly to each other. Images we receive from objects we assume have existence in the external world (taste, odour, sound, sight, solidity) are all transmitted by neurons to 
the relevant centres in the brain. Hence, what the brain receives are only electrical signals. For instance, during the process of seeing, light clusters (photons) that travel from the object to the eye pass through the lens in front of the eye where they
 
are refracted and fall inverted on the retina at the back of the eye. The electrical signal generated by the retina is perceived as an image in the visual centre of the brain after a series of processes. And we, in a part of our brain called the visual ce
ntre, which takes up only a few cubic centimetres, perceive a colourful, bright world that has depth, height and width.
\par A similar system applies in all the other senses. Tastes, for instance, are turned into electrical signals by some special cells in the mouth and on the tongue and transmitted to the relevant centre in the brain. 
\par An example will further clarify this subject. Let's assume that at the moment you are drinking a glass of lemonade. The coolness and solidity of the glass you hold is converted in
to electrical signals by special cells under your skin and transmitted to the brain. Simultaneously, the odour of the lemonade, the sweet taste you experience when you sip it and the yellow colour you see when you look at the glass are all transmitted to 
t
he brain in the form of electrical signals. The noise you hear when you put the glass on the table is similarly perceived by your ear and transmitted to the brain as an electrical signal. Sensory centres in the brain that are essentially different yet wor
k
 in co-operation with each other interpret all of these perceptions. As a result of this interpretation, you assume yourself to drink a glass of lemonade. In other words, everything takes place in the sensory centres in the brain while you think that thes
e perceptions have a solid existence. 
\par However, at this point you are simply deceived since you have no evidence to assume that what you perceive in your brain has a material correlate outside your skull. 
\par The subject that has been explained so far is an OBVIOUS fact proved true by science today. Any scientist would tell you the way this system works and that the world we live in is in reality an aggregate of perceptions. 
\par No doubt, this is a reality that requires profound reflection. Up until now, it is ent
irely possible you assumed that everything you see in the outer world has an absolute reality. However, as science also verifies, there is no way to prove that objects have material correlates in the outer world. 
\par So far we talked about the fact that we live in our skulls and perceive nothing more than that which our senses perceive. Now let's proceed a step further: "Do the things we perceive have an actual existence or are they imaginary?"
\par Let's start by asking: is there a need for the external world in order to see or hear?
\par No. There is by no means a need for the external world in order to see or hear. Stimulation of the brain in any form triggers the functioning of all the senses, forming feelings, visions and noises. The best example explaining this reality is the dream. 

\par While dreaming, you lie on your bed, in a dark and quiet room, your eyes shut tight. Nothing reaches you from outside for you to perceive\'85 neither light nor noise. However in your dreams, you ex
perience any of the things you are likely to experience in your daily life, just as vividly and clearly as in reality. In your dreams, you also wake up and hurry to work. Alternatively, in your dreams you go on a holiday and feel the summer sunshine. 

\par Besi
des, during the course of your dreams, you feel no doubts about what you see. Only waking up makes you realise that it was all a dream. In your dreams, you fear, feel anxious, happy or sorry. Simultaneously, you experience the solidity of matter. However,
 there exists no source producing these perceptions. You are still in a dark and quiet room. 
\par In this case, just as we experience our dreams as real and only realise that it was a world of fancy when we awake, we cannot claim that what we experience when aw
ake is real. So, it is entirely probable that, we may well at any time be awoken from the life on earth, which we think we are living right now, and start experiencing real life. We have no evidence with which to deny it. On the contrary, the findings of 
modern science raise serious doubts about the assertion that what we experience in our daily lives has actual existence. 
\par In this case, we come face to face with an obvious fact: while we think that this world in which we live exists, there is no ground on which to base this supposition. It is entirely possible that these perceptions do not have material correlates. 
\par If the thing we acknowledge as the material world is merely comprised of perceptions shown to us, then what is the brain, by which we hear, see and think? Isn't the brain, like everything else, a collection of atoms and molecules?
\par Like everything else we consider "matter", our brains are also perception\'85 it is surely no exception. After all, our brains are also pieces of meat that we perceive by 
our senses. Like everything we assume to exist in the outer world, it is only an image for us. 
\par So, who perceives all these? Who sees, hears, smells and tastes? 
\par All these bring us face to face with an obvious fact: a human being who sees, feels, thinks an
d is conscious is more than just the sum of the atoms and molecules which make up his body. What makes a person a human being is actually the SPIRIT Allah grants him. Otherwise, attribution of consciousness and all human attributes and skills to a piece o
f meat of 1.5 kg would be definitely irrational, not to mention that this piece of meat is only an illusion.

 by Allah and of understanding that He is the only absolute being.
\par The person who understands this subject realises that the world is not the sort of place it is surmised by most people to be. The world is not an absolute place with a true existence as supp
osed by those who wander aimless about the streets, who get into fights in pubs, who show off in luxurious cafes, who brag about their property, or who dedicate their lives to hollow aims. The world is only a collection of perceptions, an illusion. All of
 the people we have cited above are only shadow beings who watch these perceptions in their minds: yet they are not aware of this.

This unawareness is the outcome of the lack of wisdom given to disbelievers by Allah. As it is said in the Qur'an, the unbeli
evers "have hearts wherewith they understand not, eyes wherewith they see not, and ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle-nay more misguided: for they are heedless (of warning)." (Surat al-Araf, 179)

n(perception)" and that the only absolute being is Allah: 
\par Allah... The substance of these beings which He created is but nothingness... He created all at the sphere of senses and illusions... The existence of the universe is at the sphere of senses and ill

bbani have written that it might have been inconvenient to tell this fact to the masses and that most people would not be able to grasp it.

Time is also a kind of perception resulting from conclusions we make from our sensory experience. This perception occurs as a result of apparently consecutive events taking place. We perceive the flow of time by c
omparing the changes in motions we observe one with another. We hear the door ringing, for instance. Ten minutes later it rings again. We perceive that there is an interval between the first ring and second, and interpret this interval as "time". Alternat
i
vely, a glass falls and breaks, coal burns and becomes ashes, we walk and find ourselves in one corner of the room while a moment ago we were in the opposite corner. The time passing between these causes and effects and the movements we observe around us 
g
ives us clues about the passage of time. Our past experiences also provide us clues enabling us to make almost accurate estimates about how much time an event needs to takes place. If we measure that it takes 10 minutes to walk from home to the nearest bu
s
 station, we can assume that it will take approximately 10 minutes to walk the same distance again. Yet someone who is asked how long it takes to walk this distance will probably have little idea if he has never walked that distance before, except accordi
ng to his experience of having walked similar distances. 
\par The sun rises, sets and by the time it again rises the next day, we say, "a day passed by." When this process is repeated for 30 or 31 days, we say this time, "A month passed." Yet, if you were asked
 about that month, you would confess that the whole month passed like a moment, realising that you do not recall many details about that month. Still, all the cause and effect relations together with all the actions we observe give us clues about time. If
 
night did not follow day and we did not have a watch indicating the time, we would probably arrive at erroneous conclusions about how many minutes or hours passed by or when the day begins and ends. That is why time is, in fact, a perception we can never 
comprehend without the existence of points of comparison. 
\par The way time's flow is perceived also shows that time is only a psychological perception. While you are waiting for your friend in the middle of a street, a ten minutes' delay seems like a long, alm
ost everlasting period of time. Alternatively, a person who hasn't had enough sleep at night may perceive a ten minutes' nap in the morning as very long and relaxing. Sometimes just the contrary happens. At school, a boring forty minutes' lesson may seem 
to be like ages while a ten minutes break passes very quickly. Or, you perceive the weekend you impatiently await as a very short period of time while working days seem long. 
\par No doubt, these are the feelings, shared by almost everyone, indicating that time changes according to the one who perceives it and his state. 
\par Allah, in the Qur'an, draws our attention to the fact that time is a psychological perception:

 the Creator of time, is by no means dependent on it. This is a crucial fact and it provides the answer to a crucial question asked by many people: what is destiny?
\par The majority of people experience difficulty in understanding the meaning of the concept of destiny. 
\par Destiny is the eternal knowledge of Allah, Who is independent of time and Who prevails over the whole of time and space, about all occurrences and situations of all the beings that are dependent on time. Allah is the Creator of all these actions
 and situations just as He is the Creator of "time." In the same way as we easily see a ruler's beginning, middle, and end, and all the units in between as a whole, Allah knows the time to which we are subject to as if it were a single moment right from i
ts beginning to its end.
\par No doubt, this is certain. Allah, Who is not bound by the relative time-frame within which we are confined, encompasses everything time-related. Despite this obvious fact, the majority of people have a distorted understanding of des
tiny. They assume that they can step out of the boundaries of destiny, "overcome their destiny" or they can live a life separate and independent from destiny. However, as stated earlier, our destinies are in the eternal knowledge of Allah and Allah knows 
a
ll incidents in the past, present and future, as a single moment. It is unlikely that human beings, who are subject to time, can exceed the boundaries of this single moment and change anything or manage it by their own will. To claim the contrary would be
 irrational.
\par We are again face to face with an irrefutable fact: it is implausible that one can change or divert one's own destiny. Surely, the existence of every moment of one's life is dependent upon the exercise of the will of Allah and man cannot do any
thing, even he cannot think, without the will of Allah.
