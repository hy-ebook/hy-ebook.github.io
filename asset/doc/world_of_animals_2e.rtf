\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in man\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Mala

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defe

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hese works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other boo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

phasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Q\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point sh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ould be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveyi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this section, we are going to learn about some of the very interesting qualities Allah has given squirrels. We ar\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e sure what you will read about these loveable little beings will also amaze your friends.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Squirrels live mostly in the forests of Europe and north America. They are about 25 centimetres (10 inches)long. That is the size of two of your hands. Behind them a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd often suspended over their backs are their tails, wide, upright and furry, and almost the same size as their length. There is surely a purpose why Allah, Who creates everything with a purpose, has given squirrels such a tail: Thanks to this long tail, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  squirrel can jump from one tree to another without losing its balance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The sharp little nails of a squirrel allow it to climb trees without difficulty. It can readily run along branches, hang upside-down and move while in this position. A grey squirrel in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 particular can jump from the tip of a branch to the branch of another tree four metres (13 feet)away. While jumping, it extends its fore and hind limbs and glides. Meanwhile, its flattened tail both maintains its balance and serves as a rudder to steer i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . It can even experience free-fall from a branch nine metres (30 feet) above the ground and land smoothly on the ground on four feet. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let's consider once again what these loveable squirrels can accomplish. You already know that squirrels can perform \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gymnastic moves in the air quite easily, such as jumping from one tree to another without falling and, furthermore, target very tiny branches from a distance and skilfully hold on to them like a trapeze artist. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
But how? Well, squirrels can achieve all these feats by using their hind limbs, their keen eyes, which make good adjustments for distances, their strong paws, and their tails, which enable them to maintain balance. But, have you ever thought who has given
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
squirrels these features and taught them how to use them? Since it is impossible for a squirrel family to take a ruler and measure the heights of trees and lengths of branches, how do they measure distances as they jump from one tree to another? Furthermo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e, how do they jump and bounce so fast without getting hurt or crippled? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No doubt, it is Allah Who has created these animals together with the features they have and taught them how to use them. Furthermore, squirrels possess all the necessary skills and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
physical attributes to reach walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts and pine nuts, the hard-shelled fruits that grow on top of high trees. As with all other animals in nature, Allah specially created squirrels so that they can readily attain the kind of food they 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eed.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  In wintertime it becomes hard for squirrels to find food, so in summer they gather food to eat in the long, cold months ahead. Squirrels are among those living beings that store food for winter. 
\par }\pard\plain \s16\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid5189086 \fs22\lang1033\langfe2052\loch\af8\hich\af8\dbch\af13\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp2052 {\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, squirrels are very careful while gathering t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
heir food. They don't store fruits and meat, the kind of food that decays quickly. If they gathered them, they would become hungry in the wintertime. For this reason, squirrels collect only durable dry fruits like walnuts, hazelnuts and cones. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is Allah\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Who gives this knowledge to squirrels at birth and enables them to take their nutrition. Here, we witness one of the attributes of Allah: Allah is "ar-Razzaq", that is, "the One Who continually provides sustenance to every living being He has created".

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sq\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uirrels store their food for winter by burying it in various places. Thanks to their perfect sense of smell, they can detect the smell of nuts covered by 30 centimetres (12 inches)of snow. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Squirrels carry their food in their sacs and take them to their ne\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sts. In their nests, there are more than one store, most of which they have forgotten. Certainly there is also a divine reason for this, because in time the dry fruits forgotten by squirrels under the earth grow into new trees.

Squirrels have strong sharp teeth such as human beings never possess. Located at the front of their mouth are incisor teeth that enable them to gnaw and break hard substances. Located behind them are the molar teeth. When we want to break a waln
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ut, we either use a big stone or a device especially designed for this purpose. These little animals, however, can readily accomplish this with their sharp teeth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Have you ever wondered how squirrels' teeth stay strong throughout a lifetime and how squirre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ls whose teeth are broken manage to eat hazelnuts or walnuts? Allah, Who has created everything in perfect harmony, has given their teeth a very important characteristic. You will indeed be very astonished when you hear this! Even if squirrels' teeth brea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 or wear out, new teeth grow immediately. Worn-out teeth are continually replaced by growing ones. Moreover, Allah has not only given this characteristic to squirrels but also to all creatures who have to gnaw their food. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Like most other animals, squirrel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s do have methods of communication with one another. Red squirrels, for example, upon seeing an enemy, shake their tails and begin to make excited noises. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Squirrels, who can run on high tree branches also use their tails for balance. They change their dir\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ection by rotating their tails. The tails of squirrels serve the same function as the rudder of a vessel. The whiskers of a squirrel also play a major role in their keeping their balance. When squirrels' whiskers are cut, they cannot maintain their balanc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . This aside, they also use their whiskers to sense the objects around them at nights. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Children! Do you know that some squirrel species can also fly? All the "flying squirrel" species in Australia, whose heights vary from 45 to 90 centimetres (18 to 35 in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ches), live on trees. We cannot say that they really fly. They make long jumps from one tree to another. These creatures, who move among trees like gliders, have no wings but "flying membranes". The "sugar glider", a kind of flying squirrel with a flying 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
embrane that extends from the fore to hind limbs, has a narrow body and long tassel-like hairs. In some species, the flying membrane is made up of furry skin. This membrane extends to the wrist of the forelimb. The gliding squirrel jumps from the trunk of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a tree and can traverse about 30 metres (100 feet) at a time by means of a glide-like effect produced by its stretched membrane. In some cases, they can even make six successive glides, covering a total distance of 530 metres (1,740 feet). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When they don't\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 move, the bodies of these small animals quickly lose heat and they become vulnerable to freezing. For this reason, sleeping is a great threat to squirrels. However, Allah has created various protective mechanisms for every species, enabling them to survi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e under unfavourable environmental conditions. During sleep, for instance, squirrels just curl their fluffy tails tightly around their bodies. The tail of the squirrel is just like a coat. On wintry days, their tails save them from freezing. }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Would you like to learn a bit more about rabbits, the loveable little living creatures we sometimes keep in our houses as pets? We always think of them with thei\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r snow-white fur, which we take such pleasure in stroking, and the way they gnaw carrots. Let's explore some of the interesting characteristics of these animals with which we are not familiar:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you try to approach a rabbit, you will immediately recognise\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 how fast it escapes. Do you know that these creatures can readily sense their enemies with their long ears even while their heads are down eating grass? Owing to this keen sense of hearing, you can hardly approach them without them noticing you. Before l
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng, they will perceive a minor noise or movement and will run away. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Rabbits become 50 to 70 centimetres (19 to 27 inches) long when they grow into adults. Their hind limbs are longer and stronger than their forelimbs. That is why they can run 60 to 70 kil\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ometres (37 to 43 miles)per hour and can leap six metres (20 feet) forward at a time. A rabbit can move faster than a car travelling within the city does. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All rabbits possess these characteristics at birth. Allah has created them as fast runners and thus \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 enabled them to escape their predators easily. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What do you think the answer of a rabbit would be if we were to ask it, "Which food do you like most?" Yes, you are right! He would certainly say "carrots." (Meanwhile, remember that carrots are good for our 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eyes.) Well, do you know that rabbits live in the warrens they dig under the ground, and that carrots grow towards the depths of the earth? As you may understand from this question, carrots have been created in the most appropriate way to meet rabbits' ne
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ds. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Also for us, human beings, Allah has made everything easy to use. Take, for instance, the orange you eat in wintertime. If it were not in segments, it would be very hard for you to eat it, because it is so juicy. However, Allah, Who has created everyt
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hing you see around you, has also created this delicious fruit full of vitamin C in its segmented form, ready to eat, in its special package. Now back to rabbits! A rabbit can easily gnaw a carrot with its continually growing front teeth that give it such
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a lovely look. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Apart from their nutritional needs, Allah has given living creatures many features that make life easy for them. Various rabbit species with different characteristics live on earth. Rabbits living in cold regions, for example, are mostly wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ite in colour. This is an important feature that makes them invisible on the snow and enables them to hide themselves effortlessly. Wild rabbits, which are relatively bigger than other rabbits, have longer limbs and ears. The desert American rabbit, on th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  other hand, has quite large ears. These ears help rabbits to keep themselves cool. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In nature, most animals live in particular territories they mark out for themselves. This is similar to us living in our comfortable homes surrounded by our family members\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. Animals and animal groups usually avoid entering other animals' territories. "Leaving a scent" is a method employed by animals to mark their territories. Gazelles, for instance, leave a substance with a scent similar to tar on long thin branches and gra
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ses to mark their territory. This substance, secreted from the glands under their eyes, informs other gazelles that this field is already occupied. Reindeer, on the other hand, have scent glands on the tip of their hind feet with which they mark their ter
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 itory. Rabbits mark their territories with glands on their chins.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we have seen, Allah has created animals with very interesting and important characteristics. Learning all these makes us astonished at the flawless creation of Allah. We remember that All\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ah is our Creator and we feel grateful to Him. Remember that Allah has commanded people to think about His blessings and be thankful. In a verse of the Qur'an, Allah informs us that He will reward those who are thankful:}{\f0\insrsid9850004

somebody asks you to draw a picture of one. Would you be able to accomplish this? Of course not. No one could do this. Because, we cannot do anything unless Allah provides us an example in nature. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Aeroplanes, for example, are designed in imitation of the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
flying systems of birds. Robots are imitations of man's body systems. However, our Lord has created countless species without any previous example: Penguins living at the south pole, lions \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 the kings of the savannah, dolphins, butterflies, birds and bees\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  etc., in short, Allah created all creatures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah, Who has given all creatures various features, has also given dogs physical characteristics that make them different from other living beings. For example, dogs have 42 teeth, that is, 10 more than human
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 beings. This way, they can grind and break their food, especially bones, into pieces without difficulty. Moreover, thanks to the special creation of their eyes, in darkness dogs have better eyesight than human beings. They can perceive moving objects fro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 farther away. Furthermore, because dogs can hear voices at frequencies beyond our threshold of hearing, they notice noises from distances four times farther away than we can. For example, a man cannot hear the extremely high-pitched sound of the dog whis
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 le used to give commands to dogs while dogs can hear it easily. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The dog's sense of smell is also very keen. The olfactory centre \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  the centre for smelling \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 in its brain is forty times more developed than that of man. For this reason, their sense of smell\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  is superior to man's. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
By means of all these abilities, dogs can sense the smell of prey, trace it and fetch a hunter's catch even if it is kilometres away. A sniff of something belonging to a person suffices for a police dog to find its owner. Those huge
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  flabby-cheeked dogs the Saint Bernards, for example, can easily detect injured people stuck beneath the snow with their sensitive noses and rescue them. This extraordinary sense of smell that dogs have is itself a miracle. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Dogs also use their noses to br\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eathe air. Passing through the nose, air is filtered, warmed and moisturised and then it makes its way to the lungs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Unlike human beings, these creatures do not sweat to regulate their body temperatures, because there are no sweat glands in their body. Reg\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ulation of body temperature is handled by the respiratory system. The hair covering the body isolates the skin from external heat. As the external temperature increases, a dog's body temperature also increases; a dog whose body temperature increases gets 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
id of this excess heat by sticking out its tongue. This way, in spite of their thick hair, they do not sweat on hot days. Allah has given them such a perfect system, whereas we, human beings, immediately sweat when we run even for half an hour. But dogs n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ver sweat even if they run for hours. Now that you have learned this fact, you don't have to worry about dogs when you see them with their tongues lolling out on hot days. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Also, if you think about dogs, you will remember that their bodies are always very \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 soft and bright. What gives this softness and brightness to their skin is its oil glands. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are some special systems within dogs' bodies. Thanks to these systems, the paws of a dog are never hurt, nor do they wear out and their claws never become irri\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tated. As you see, our Lord has solved even a minor problem of one creature by means of a protective mechanism He has designed for it. Our Lord creates everything in harmony. As this example also shows, Allah has equipped all creatures with the abilities 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hey need. Such examples lead us to think and to realise the artistry in our Lord's creation.}{\f0\insrsid9850004

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, do you know what protects a lamb from rain?\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Its skin! As lambskin consists of a soft fatty layer, it serves as a raincoat preventing the lamb from becoming wet. This makes its wool curl and remain dry on rainy days. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Besides, one of the most important characteristics of lambs is their rumination. H\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ave you ever seen an animal ruminating? Let us tell you about it. Some animals that feed on grass ruminate. Characteristically, these animals have a stomach divided into four compartments. When the animal eats something, the food first goes to the stomach
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
then comes back to the mouth again. After the animal chews it, it goes to the other chamber of the stomach. This process is called "rumination". Our Lord has given this capability to some animals the better to digest some indigestible foods. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sheep and lam\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Today, you can see thousands of cars on the streets and there are many motorways built for these cars. Cars, however, came into the service of man only in the last century. At the time your grandfather's grandfather was born, there were no car
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s. In those years, animals, especially horses, were used for transportation.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you know that you can identify the age of a horse by looking at its incisors? Indeed, since the grass on which horses feed contains sand and dust, their teeth wear out gradual\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ly and the degree of this indicates their age. Despite this, however, horses' teeth are very long. These teeth are similar to long strips buried deep in the roots of the jawbone. That is, compared to our teeth, the roots of horses' teeth reside deep insid
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. As the teeth wear out, the part remaining in the jawbone begins to emerge. In fact, the roots of the teeth of very old horses appear on the surface of the gum. Each tooth may wear out about two and a half to five centimetres (one to two inches) before i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  loses its ability to chew. Think for a moment: had our Lord not given this feature to horses, these animals would quickly lose their teeth and die of starvation.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Our Lord has also given another important ability to the hair of horses. Horsehair serves as\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a thermostat \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  a device used to regulate body temperature \hich\f0 \endash 
\loch\f0  for the animal. Their body must always remain at a constant body temperature of 38 degrees Centigrade (100.4 F). To maintain this temperature, the hair of the horse becomes longer in winter. In \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ot seasons, horses shed their hair, thereby maintaining this body temperature. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here is another interesting feature of horses: Horses sleep on their feet! Do you know how they manage not to fall down? Because their leg bones have the ability to lock themse\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lves while asleep. Thanks to this ability our Lord has given horses, they can sleep on their feet and also carry very heavy loads. The heads of human beings, however, fall down even when they fall asleep in an armchair. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Horses' legs are specially created \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
not only to make them carry heavy loads but also to make them run very fast. Unlike other animals, horses do not have collarbones, a feature that enables them to take bigger steps. Besides, there is a bone-muscle mechanism in their limbs that, as they gai
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 speed, decreases the amount of energy they spend and increases their ability to move. The functioning principles of this mechanism is similar to the gear mechanism in cars. Just as an accelerating car shifts to a higher gear, horses, too, shift to a high
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r gear when they want to run faster. While the force required for pushing decreases, the ability to move increases. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, why are horses' bodies designed in a way to make them carry heavy loads and run very fast? Actually, carrying heavy loads or running \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
very fast are not skills that a horse needs for itself. So, why do horses have these abilities?

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The answer is obvious. These skills have been given to horses not to meet their own needs but to serve human beings. In other words, Allah has created horses wi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet, their appearance is strikingly different. As you might also suppose, this difference lies in the straight stripes that cover their bodies from head to toe. Do \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
not underestimate a stripe, since these stripes are different in every single zebra. Just like the fingerprint, which is unique to every person, the stripes of zebras are all different. Stripes provide identification data for a zebra just like an ID card 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oes for humans. The vertical stripes of zebras are also an important element of defence. When they come together, tigers and lions perceive the herd as a whole. In this case, it becomes difficult for the predator to choose the individual zebra, which beco
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es a protection for the zebras. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are two essential elements necessary for zebras to survive: water and grass.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At times, a zebra herd wanders for 50 kilometres (31 miles) to find water and grass. But at nights they return to their own places. That is \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
because, as we mentioned earlier about other animals, each herd leads its life in a particular territory.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you know that zebras very much like to take dust-baths? Indeed, zebras are very fond of dust-baths. That is because, dust-baths remove the parasit\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es living on their bodies. Apart from this, zebras have guests that accompany them and help them in their cleaning. Oxpeckers feed on the ticks found on the hides of zebras. This way, one by one they pick the parasites that make zebras sick and cause them
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to itch. As you see, our Lord, Who plans and controls the lives of all the creatures and makes them helpers for each other, has also assigned some animals as helpers of others.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 About half an hour after birth, a new-born zebra stands up and begins to walk,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 though in a faltering trembling manner. No sooner do they walk than they begin to suck their mothers' milk. Milk is very beneficial for a new-born creature. This milk, which is pink in colour by a special creation of Allah, protects them from illnesses f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 om birth onwards. Besides that, it secures the proper functioning of their intestines. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Zebras, as is the case with all other creatures under Allah's protection, are equipped with defence mechanisms that Allah has taught them. The first of these defence me\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
chanisms is their very sensitive sensory organs, such as seeing, hearing and smell, which Allah has given them at birth. The sensitivity of these sensory organs enables zebras to notice their predators quickly and run away. No sooner do they begin to run 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 han they reach an incredible speed. The second defence mechanism is the following: when the herd fall asleep, one or two zebras stay awake and watch out for possible threats.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Zebras employ the defence tactics that are similar to those of human beings. Howe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ver, it is interesting that these animals live in harmony in herds and make a division of labour. It is obvious that it is Allah Who creates zebras, collects them together and provides their sustenance and Who commands them to make a division of labour. I
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  this was not the case, no one would be able to explain why some zebras make sacrifices such as staying awake all night long to protect the others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On the other hand, for the new-born zebra who has recently opened his eyes to this world, the defence tactic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s Allah has taught him are much simpler. All he has to do is stay close to his mother. That is because, it is impossible for a new-born zebra to see stealthy enemies with his newly opened eyes or run away from them with his weak, trembling limbs. You see,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Allah has inspired the new-born zebra to remain next to his mother always until he grows up. Otherwise, how could he know that there are predators around waiting for him and that the most secure place for him is with his mother? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Most zebras live on open g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rasslands where there is not much possibility to hide. For this reason, in order to stay alive, they need to move very fast. All the body structure of a zebra is devised to meet this need. For instance, their limbs are very long; they can run very long di
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tances without becoming exhausted or losing speed. Although light, the bones of zebras are very strong. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Zebras feel the need to drink water very often. In regions where water is scarce, they use their sharp sense of smell and dig a hole to reach fresh wat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er. In moments of danger, mature zebras push young zebras into the middle of the herd to protect them. As the zebras run together, young animals always remain inside the herd and run close to their mothers for better protection.

Often reaching a height of five to six metres (15-20 feet), you could find a resemblance between giraffes and speckled towers. The longest part of a giraffe is its neck. Its long neck enables it to reach the remotest branches on trees and feed by 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
grazing on the sprouts and leaves. These thorny plants, which the giraffes don't chew, first go directly into their four-compartment stomach. Then they regurgitate them back to the mouth, where the giraffe chews them. Finally, they swallow them again and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 end them to another compartment in their stomach. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, there is something very interesting about this process. As we have recently mentioned, giraffes regurgitate thorny plants from their stomachs back to their mouths to be chewed. But, as you may ima
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gine, this is rather a long journey. The food needs to travel a distance of three or four metres (10-13 feet) in the long neck of the giraffe. As you can also imagine, it is unlikely that the food could proceed to its destination on its own. You are curio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s about how giraffes could manage this, right? Let us explain it: there is a lift-like system in a giraffe's neck that makes this possible. No doubt, it is impossible for giraffes to think, "In order to digest our food, we need to send it back to our mout
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s; so, we must build a lift system to accomplish this". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On the other hand, such a system could not have come about by accident. You would certainly laugh at a person who tells you, "I went to that vacant area where many years ago I left some materials to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
construct a building. To my surprise, I found a huge building instead of the materials. No doubt, rain, snow and sun must have worked together to build this building over the years." You would also think that this man must have gone insane and would there
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ore feel pity for him. It would likewise be unreasonable to think that the lift system in a giraffe's neck had come into being in the same way. Such a system could not have come into existence by chance. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, a giraffe is not a lifeless building m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ade up of rocks, soil and mud bricks. It is a living being that runs, feels hungry and delivers babies. Is it possible that such a living being could have come into existence accidentally? Is it possible that coincidence could grant him a long neck equipp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d with workable systems? Of course not.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is obvious that anything a giraffe needs has been given it at birth by Allah. Allah has specially created the mouth and stomach structures of giraffes so that they can eat thorny, spiky plants without difficulty. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
As in the case of the structure of its neck, the way a giraffe sleeps reminds us of Allah's existence. While sleeping, giraffes extend their necks towards their body. Except for a few minutes, they sleep on their feet in this position. Giraffes do not sle
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ep all at the same time; one of them stays awake to protect the others. That a giraffe sacrifices its sleep for the sake of other giraffes and their reaching agreement about this shows us Allah's control over giraffes as in the case of all other animals. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Now, let's set aside how these speckled animals eat their food and talk about the way they drink water. Probably most people have never thought about how a giraffe bends down and drinks water without difficulty. However, our Lord, Who is the Creator of ev
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rything, wants us to ponder over such delicate systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, let's make it clear that while drinking water, a serious problem awaits these long-necked creatures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To understand this essential problem, we need to remember one thing: Do you recall what ha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ppens when you try to stand upside down? Exactly! Your face immediately turns red. That is because, our blood rushes to our heads with the effect of the force of gravity and exerts a pressure on the veins, which is called "blood pressure". 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is exactly\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  what should happen when giraffes try to drink water. However, as you may also imagine this could be a major problem. Since giraffes are very tall animals}{\f0\insrsid5189086 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \loch\af0\dbch\af13\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  around five or six metres (15-20 feet) \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  the blood pressure on the head bending down from such a he
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ight becomes very great. If a human being were exposed to such high blood pressure, his brain would immediately burst. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This being the case, how do giraffes drink water without having a cerebral haemorrhage? That is because, Allah, the Creator of space, th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e sky, the earth and all creatures, has placed a very special mechanism inside a giraffe's head. There are little valves inside the veins of a giraffe's head. Once the height of a giraffe's head changes, these valves start to operate and prevent high bloo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  pressure in the head. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Well, have you ever thought about why giraffes are speckled? This aesthetic appearance, in harmony with the grasslands, makes it hard for their enemies to distinguish the giraffes. Despite their giant bodies, they can thus hide from
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the king of the savannah, that is the lion, their foremost enemy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In moments of danger, giraffes run at speeds of 55 to 60 kilometres (34 to 37 miles) per hour. When they begin to run, they move their heads back and forth like a pump, and curl their tails\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. Unlike other animals, giraffes do not take crossed steps. That is, they move their left front and hind limbs first, and then the right front and hind limbs. Owing to this, lions are hardly able to catch giraffes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is, no doubt, not the case for young\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 giraffes. With their premature and weak limbs, they cannot run as fast as their mothers. For this reason, they become easy prey for lions. Yet, as we mentioned earlier, these babies always remain with their mothers. With their long limbs, mothers can giv
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Elephants, the largest animals on land, have two major kinds of species; African and Asian elephants. African elephants are larger than the others. They may be as high as three and a half metres (12 feet) and their weight reach around six tons (12,000 po
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 unds). Their fan-shaped ears are two metres (6.5 feet) long and one and a half metres (5 feet) wide. As you can imagine, with such a giant body, you can't keep an elephant at home as a pet. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What makes an elephant especially different is his trunk. This lo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng trunk, similar to a garden hose, includes fifty thousand muscles. What you have read is right: "50,000" muscles! Its nostrils are at the tip of this trunk. Elephants use their trunks to put food and water into their mouths, to lift things and, of cours
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , to smell. This trunk is capable of holding four litres of water. They either squirt this water into their mounts and drink it or spray it on their bodies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Surprisingly, an elephant can even pick up a tiny pea seed with its trunk}{\f0\insrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \loch\af0\dbch\af13\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 which can lift such hu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ge things \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 break it in its mouth and eat it. It is really amazing that such a huge animal can accomplish such delicate operations. This "multifunctional" trunk can be used as a long finger, a trumpet or sometimes as a loudspeaker. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Besides that, elephant\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s use their trunks to spray water on themselves to have a shower or throw dust on themselves for a dust-bath. Yet, new-born elephants fail to use their trunks. They sometimes even step on their trunks and fall down. We may find this amusing but surely the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e little babies do not like it. A mother elephant accompanies her young elephant for twelve years. During the first six months, she teaches the baby how to use its trunk and she never becomes bored doing this. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On both sides of their mouths, elephants have\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  two long sharp tusks. These tusks help them to protect themselves. Also, an elephant uses one of these tusks to dig holes in the ground and find water. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The teeth of these animals \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  which chew fibrous plants \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  wear out easily. For this reason, our Lord ha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s given them a very important characteristic: Every worn-out tooth is replaced by another in the back row. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One full-grown elephant can eat 330 kilograms (726 pounds) of plants everyday. This amount is equal to six small bales of straw. Everyday, elephants\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  spend most of their time feeding themselves. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let us give you another interesting piece of information about elephants. Have you ever thought how these huge thick-skinned animals cool themselves? As you might imagine, elephants cannot sweat because o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f their thick skins. Instead, they cool themselves with the help of the water and mud they see around. Of course, elephants have other methods to freshen themselves. For example, they use their ears as fans and cool their bodies with them. The thin blood 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eins on their ears also cool them and cause overall refreshment. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another feature of elephants has surprised hunters and zoologists for a long time. What astonished them was the rumbling of elephants' stomachs. While rumbling, elephants' stomachs make very\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 loud noises. Yet, what is astonishing is not the loudness of these noises but the way elephants control them. In fact these noises have nothing to do with digestion. The elephants make these noises to detect the location of their friends. More surprising
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y, in the face of a danger, they all of a sudden become silent. Once they sense the threat is over, they start making noise again. Thanks to this method, elephants can communicate with one another even from four kilometres away. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e migration stories of elephants have always astonished zoologists. These animals with their giant ears and huge bodies migrate in the dry seasons and always follow the same paths. What is even more interesting is that they clean up garbage such as chips 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f wood they find on their way.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Since elephants are animals that spread over vast areas of land, it is essential that they establish strong "communications" between them. Elephants do not owe this communication to their sharp sense of smell alone. Beside t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his, Allah has created an organ on their forehead, which makes a hoarse noise. Thanks to this organ, elephants talk to each other with a secret, coded language other animals fail to understand. These hoarse noises elephants make can reach very long distan

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , yet they are much thicker, harder and bigger. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Except for the reindeer, in general only male deer have antlers. Once the mating season is over, these antlers drop off and are renewed by others growing from beneath them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 While antlers grow, they are cove\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
red by a thin, velvet-like layer of skin. Once the antler is fully-grown, the veins are cut and thus can no longer feed the skin. At this stage, the deer abrades the skin by rubbing its antlers against hard surfaces causing the bony structure to appear. A
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  six years of age, their antlers become fully-developed. After this age, they begin gradually to deteriorate. The length, shape and number of branches differ from one deer to another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You have probably asked yourself, "Why do deer have antlers?" Antlers a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re an important weapon for deer. With antlers they can protect themselves from enemies. Sometimes, a predator only has to see the antlers to leave the deer alone. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A male red deer draws a border around its territory by smearing a substance secreted from hi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s scent gland. In this territory, he sets up a herd consisting of female deer (doe). He protects his herd with his antlers from his enemies. Upon the entry of an alien into his territory, he pushes him out of it either by his roars or by attempting to gor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  him with the antlers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Allah has created these animals with antlers on their heads, thereby making it possible for them to protect themselves and their herds. If Allah had not given them antlers, these animals would have remained defenceless and helpless a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 gainst their enemies. A male deer could not protect female deer and thus his herd couldn't be constituted. They would not have a weapon against wild animals. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Possibly, few people would ever think, "I wish some animals had a hard, bony substance having a b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ranch-like structure on their heads, so that they could protect themselves". Even if it were the case, these people would fail to make this wish come true. Only Allah, Who has created all creatures most beautifully, has provided deer and other animals wit

\loch\f0  reached its mother's pouch after a three minute journey.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
our different nipples in the pouch of the mother. The new-born sucks the nipple that issues a milk with just the right temperature and amount of fat for a new-born. The other three nipples, on the other hand, contain milk meeting the needs of an older bab
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. In a few weeks, the new-born stops suckling its nipple and finds another nipple from which issues a milk prepared for its own needs. As it grows older, it finds a third nipple with the type of milk specially prepared for its needs. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Children! At this poi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nt, you must ask yourself the questions, "How can a baby kangaroo one centimetre long know the right nipple that would meets its needs?", "How has the mother kangaroo placed milk in her four nipples with such different ingredients?" What is more, the milk
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the new-born baby sucks is hotter than the other milk from the other nipples. Their ingredients are also different. This being the case, how did the mother kangaroo manage to heat this milk? How has she added the necessary ingredients to this milk?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Remembe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r, it is not the mother who has accomplished all these things. The mother kangaroo does not even know that the milk issuing from the nipples is different. It is unlikely that she could compute the temperature of the milk produced by her nipples. She canno
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 manage to provide each nipple with different kinds of milk. She cannot even know that they are different. She is only a kangaroo living under Allah's watchful care. Her baby's needs are taken care of by Allah. Our Lord, the All-Compassionate and Most Mer
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iful, has placed the most appropriate milk in the most appropriate place for the babies, that is, in the mother's pouch.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, before the first joey leaves the pouch, a new brother or sister crawls into the pouch. They both live in the same pouch for a long time, without giving any harm to one another. Each joey sucks on the nipple wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 th the milk containing just the right ingredients for their needs. Then, how do the two siblings know which nipple to suck? The answer is obvious: by Allah's inspiration.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Kangaroos are awesome with their huge bodies; the body is one and a half metres long \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We always remember the greyish furred koalas wrapping their arms and legs around the trunks of eucalyptus trees. This sight o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f koalas is indeed very lovely. Meanwhile, you may wonder why we call a koala "the sleepyhead". Let's remind ourselves right away that koalas sleep 18 hours a day! 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fore and hind paws of koalas enable them to spend a great part of their lives on eucaly\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ptus trees. This is the way Allah created their paws!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Koalas can quickly climb trees with their long curled arms, and sharp claws and paws that hold tightly on to the trees. The two fingers of their fore-paws are separated from the other three. If we compa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re a human hand to theirs, then we must talk about two thumbs. These thumbs, which greatly differ from other fingers, help them to cling to small branches. Like a hook, koalas thrust their claws into trees and thus hold on to the soft and smooth surfaces 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f tree trunks. With their four paws, they can readily clutch tree branches, just like we clutch a stick, and climb trees after they wrap their paws around their branches. These are what makes a koala's life on trees easy! 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Although koalas are known to be l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
azy, they can move very quickly on trees. They can even jump from one branch to another, covering a distance of a metre (39 inches) in a leap. Female koalas give birth to a single baby in two years and, like kangaroos, they carry it in their pouch. During
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the first months, the baby koala remains in its mother's pouch. After this period, the baby hitches a piggyback ride for a year. The mother picks a favourite tree in the eucalyptus forest for its home because she eats eucalyptus leaves \hich\f0 \endash 
\loch\f0  and that's about \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ll she eats! That is why you can only find koalas in Australia, where eucalyptus trees are legion. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Although there are more than 600 species of eucalyptus tree in Australia, koalas only eat certain leaves from 35 of them. Koalas can't live just anywhere be\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cause, apart from being a store of leaves, the eucalyptus trees constitute a unique shelter for them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are many kinds of koala species. Each species feed on a different kind of eucalyptus leaf. If you are planning to move a koala away, you need also t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o take the eucalyptus leaves on which he feeds with you. Apart from their diets, koalas rarely climb down eucalyptus trees because they are hardly able to move around on the ground. The eucalyptus tree's leaves constitute different chemical substances. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
se substances are poisonous and dangerous for all animals except for koalas. Before swallowing, koalas grind these leaves with their teeth. The harmful elements in the leaves are filtered in the koala's liver and expelled from the body. By the will of All
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h, this food, which is extremely poisonous for other animals, does not harm koalas. Therefore, koalas can eat about a kilogram (2.204 pounds) of poisonous leaves everyday without trouble. Koalas even get their water from these leaves. At certain times of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he year, two thirds of the eucalyptus leaf consists of water. Therefore, only feeding on eucalyptus leaves, a koala can survive for months without drinking water. The tops of eucalyptus trees are vulnerable to wind. For this reason, koalas have very thick
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fur. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This harmony between a poisonous plant and an animal shows us that koalas and eucalyptus tree have been created by the same Creator. This Creator, Who creates everything perfectly, is surely Allah, the Lord of all the worlds.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Bears, famous for their shaggy coats and eating honey, have a very poor sense of sight and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

rance. But don't think for a moment that they are slow. Indeed, they can run at 48 kilometres (30 miles) per hour. We also need to mention that they are very strong. With their two to three metres (6.5 to 10 feet) long bodies, some bear species climb the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 op branches of trees and spend time there. Bears, who usually feed on plants, even climb up to 30 metres (100 feet) high to find food. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Once a bear finds a beehive, it strikes it a few times with its paws, which causes all the bees in the hive to escape. T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

ars that hibernate in autumn never leave their secure dens where they lie covered with dry branches and grasses until spring. Before hibernation, they eat a lot, especially cones and chestnuts, so that the fat layer underlying their skin thickens. They ha

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to this fatty milk, and get ready to go out of their caves in the spring. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Have you heard that the polar bear is a very good swimmer and diver? That is true! The polar bear is a skilled swimmer and diver. While swimming, it uses its forelegs. That it can u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The polar bear lives in the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 coldest regions of the world such as the North Pole, Northern Canada and Northern Siberia. But the feet of the polar bear never become cold. You could hardly keep your feet or hands on ice for more than a couple of minutes. Surprisingly, however, the pol

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you know why the colour of pol\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

g, polar bears also employ some tactics. Now, visualise a polar bear with its snow-white fur looking like a snowman. Do you think anyone would notice it if it lays on the snow? If you only considered its white fur, you might have said "yes". But, remember
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that the polar bear also has a black nose. On white snow, this nose makes perfect camouflage impossible. But the polar bear does something very intelligent and eliminates this problem. It covers its nose with its white forepaws. Totally hidden in the snow

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This point deserves particular attention because for a polar bear to employ hunting tactics it must be intelligent. Think for a moment: the polar bear is aware that its white colour is a perfect match for the environment in

After an incubation period of two months, the male penguin loses 1/3 of his weight. In the same case, a human being of 60 kilograms (132 pounds) would lose 20 kilograms (44 pounds). After the egg hatches, the baby penguin spends its first two m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
onths between his parent's feet. This protection is vital for the baby because leaving this warm place for only a couple of minutes would result in death. It is surely Allah Who inspires the parents to protect their baby in this way. In this, we once agai

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A bird uses great energy when it takes wing because it has to lift all its body with its tiny wings. Yet, once it is up in the air, Allah has made it easy for it to remain al\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 gs again. By means of this feature Allah has given birds, they can cover very long distances and migrate to remote destinations. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are bird species that can cover distances between 1000 to 40000 kilometres (621 and 24840 miles). Considering that it is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 40000 kilometres (24840 miles)around the earth, you can conceive better the long distances covered by birds. Passing over the oceans, they have no chance to take a break and rest. How birds maintain their direction during their thousands of kilometres lo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g flights still remains a mystery. Each year, birds migrate to their destinations without losing their ways. This holds true for young birds as well as adults. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is interesting that birds' legs, so slender and little in comparison to their bodies, can ca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rry their entire bodies. It is amazing that so many muscles, veins and nerves can exist in such a slender leg! If birds' legs were thicker and relatively more bulky, it would be more difficult for them to fly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Almost all birds sleep on one leg. This does \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
not upset their balance since their body weight is concentrated on this one leg. Allah has created birds with the features that enable them to maintain such a delicate balance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the best sensory organs of birds is their eyes. Apart from the ability t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o fly, Allah has also granted birds superior sight, because, flight, which is itself a miracle, becomes extremely dangerous unless it is supported by superior sight. Birds can see objects at a distance much better than human beings and have a wider angle 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f vision. Noticing the dangers beforehand, they accurately determine their speed and the direction of their flight. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Birds' eyes remain fixed in the eye sockets, that is, they can't move their eyes as human beings can. However, they can widen the angle of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 vision by rapidly turning their heads and necks. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, night birds such as owls have very large eyes. Some special cells in their eyes are sensitive to dim light. The vision of barred owls, for example, is 100 times keener than that of human beings
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . Thanks to this feature, owls can see and hunt very well at night.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The eyes of water fowl, on the other hand, have been created for clear underwater vision. While we can't keep our eyes open underwater for even 45 seconds, water birds can easily catch ins\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ects and molluscs in water as they plunge their heads into it. Since this is the only way for them to feed themselves, they must have clear vision underwater. For this reason, Allah has created a special structure in their eyes, which permits seeing under
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ater. Thanks to this structure, these birds don't have dim sight underwater; they see very clearly and can immediately swim towards their prey. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hearing is also very important for birds. Some birds have eardrums that enable them to hear very low sounds. Be\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing able to see very well in darkness and underwater and being able to hear very low sounds are abilities that human beings don't possess. Indeed, we don't need these faculties very much, because, we can readily lead our lives without them. However, it is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 impossible for birds to eat, feed their young, and continue their lives and their race without these abilities.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the most striking characteristics of storks i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s the way they fly. While flying, they extend their heads forward and push their legs backward. This aesthetic style of storks enables them to fly much faster by cleaving the air aerodynamically. Every year, storks migrate to warm regions because they are
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
vulnerable to cold. That is why when we see storks arriving, we also receive the glad tidings of hot summer days. In the summer season, storks live in the temperate regions that extend from Europe to North Africa and from Turkey to Japan. Before the weath

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
You have probably seen a long-necked, long-legged pink bird on TV. This bird is called the "flamingo". Flamingos leave their eggs in shallow muddy lakes. What is interesting is that the female flamingo leaves her egg in the nest she makes out of quick-dry
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng mud. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Imagine yourself in the flamingo's shoes and assume that you want to make a nest for yourself. You need primarily to discover which type of mud dries more quickly and find where the young flamingo can hatch more easily. Meanwhile, you need to find
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the answers to many questions such as "is it better to put the egg under the sun or in the shade?" However, each flamingo knows how to accomplish this. Moreover, despite her long legs offering no comfort to her, she incubates for a month and waits for he
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  young to hatch. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If you were in her shoes, would you dare to sit on the egg with your giant body? Could you estimate whether the egg would be broken, if you sat on it? Surely, it would be very difficult for you to know all these things. However, all flami
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ngos estimate these things without planning or trial and error because, they are taught so by their Lord. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Flamingos attract our attention with their eye-catching colours and long necks, and they are also very good swimmers. Their webbed feet help them to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
swim. By means of these webbed feet, which have a wide flat structure, they can walk easily without sinking even on soft mud. Furthermore, the webs between their toes provide a wide surface, so that flamingos can propel themselves through the water. As we
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 have seen, flamingos have been created with all the details necessary for their survival.

 Who inspires swans with the kind of care their eggs need. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Owing to the ability Allah has bestowed on them, swans move very fast both in water and in the air. Swans feel more comfortable in water and can swim very fast, thanks to their webbed feet.

Central Africa, can't fly. Instead, Allah has given them a different ability so that they can escape from their predators: They run very fast with their long legs. They run so fast that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
no man can keep up with them. Ostriches are the fastest two-legged animals in the animal kingdom and they reach speeds of 70 kilometres (43 miles) per hour. And now let us tell you something very interesting. Do you know that ostriches have only two toes 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n their feet? What is more, one of these toes is considerably bigger than the other. And ostriches run only on their big toes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Besides that, thanks to their long legs enabling them to run fast, ostriches are very good warriors. To protect themselves again\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 st their enemies, they kick their predators. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The egg of the biggest bird in the world is also the biggest bird egg in the world. They dig a very deep hole in the sand and place all their eggs in it. But when they lay more than 10 to 12 eggs, they need to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
adjust the size of the hole accordingly. If the ostrich dug this hole in soil instead of sand, this would take a longer time, causing the birds to consume more energy. Indeed, digging sand is much easier than soil. You may even dig sand with your hands wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reas you need a shovel to dig soil. For this reason, ostriches, by the inspiration of Allah, prefer digging in the sand rather than in soil and thus consume minimal energy. Then they cover their eggs with sand again without difficulty. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another interesting\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 piece of information about ostriches is that the care of all eggs in a flock is undertaken by a single female ostrich. But, since the nest can shelter only a limited number of eggs, the female ostrich gives priority to her own eggs. Ostriches distinguish
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 their own eggs by the air pores on the egg shells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The baby ostriches emerging from the eggs are utterly defenceless. At any moment, they could be attacked by a predatory bird. Yet, when new-born ostriches feel endangered, they lie on the ground and act a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s if dead. This way, their predators, assuming they are dead, do not attack them. Without exception, all baby ostriches employ this defence mechanism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is impossible for a new-born chick to think up such a tactic or to learn how to employ it! So, how co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uld a baby bird that has only recently opened its eyes to the world act as if dead? The answer is obvious. Our Lord, the One Who teaches and educates every living being, has also taught these little babies such an effective defence mechanism, so that they
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 can protect themselves.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, you cannot always witness this magnificent sight. You have to wait for the peacock's breeding season. The male peacock only opens his tail like a fan and displays its beauty in order to attract the female peacock's
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  attention. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Here, we need to ponder over the following: How can a male peacock, who is unable to see himself, be so sure that he will look beautiful and attractive when he displays his tail? Someone must have taught him this; is that right? No doubt, our 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Lord, Who has created such beauty, has also inspired the peacock on how to use it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Could such a perfect appearance come into existence by the effort of the peacock himself? Or, could this awe-inspiring colour harmony occur by coincidence? Surely, that is \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
unlikely. Would you believe a friend of yours who tells you that the picture hanging in your room was painted spontaneously, by the accidental splashing of paints? You would certainly not believe him! Therefore, the peacock's tail, incomparably more beaut

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What first occurs to your mind when one says "to waddle"? Usually: waddling ducklings following their mo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 thers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Ducks have two techniques they use to feed themselves. While swimming, without plunging underwater, some of them feed on insects and plants. You often see them searching for food, with their head and half of their bodies underwater. Some kinds of du
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cks, on the other hand, search for food by diving underwater. Their wide webbed feet help them to dive underwater but are not good for walking on land. That is why they only leave the water occasionally, except in the breeding season. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Water fowl such as d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ucks have air in their bodies. This is one of the reasons they float on the surface of the water. In the duck's body, there exist air sacs that look like tiny balloons. When these sacs are filled with air, they help the duck to float. When the duck wants 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o dive, it pumps the air out of the sacs and readily dives under the water since less air remains in its body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These aside, most water fowl are good swimmers. The web between their toes is one of the reasons for this. When they push one foot back, these w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ebs broaden to provide a better pushing force. Of course, it is not a coincidence that all these features required for good swimming exist in water fowl. All these features have been granted water birds by Allah, the Creator of all living beings. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Drakes, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the male ducks, always have brighter feathers than female ducks. This is an important protection for the female ducks because they incubate the eggs in their nests, since, thanks to their pale colours, predators cannot see them. Their pale colours being q
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ite suitable for camouflage, female ducks cannot be seen even at close range. The bright feathers of drakes, on the other hand, attract the predator's attention to them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When a predator comes close to the nest, the drake takes wing and makes a great deal \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of noise, making a serious effort to keep the predator away from the nest. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Adult ducks, who stroll in groups, occasionally take care of their babies. Drakes do not incubate. Just a few hours after the ducklings emerge from the eggs, they begin to swim and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 feed on their own. The newly hatched ducklings know how to feed themselves and to survive, by Allah's inspiration to them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Think about yourself. What would happen if you were allowed in the water as soon as you were born? Without doubt, as soon as you gu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lped enough water you would die of suffocation. But, since our Lord has granted ducklings the ability to swim at birth, they don't drown. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you know that ducks fly at a speed of 50 kilometres (31 miles) per hour? Do you also know that they avert wild ani\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mals by continuously changing their direction? Well, can anyone tell how ducks know to change their direction? Surely, as in the cases of the features Allah granted all other living beings, this is also a feature given to ducks by Allah.

\par }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you know that butterflies don't have wings when they are born?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 That is true! The butterfly is born without wings. It needs to pass through four phases t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o become the butterfly you see in the countryside or garden. Some have a lifespan of one to two months while some others only live for 24 hours. A butterfly emerges from the egg as a little larva. Soon, it grows into a lovely caterpillar and thus the seco
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d phase of the butterfly begins. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are a total of 14 to 15 rings on a caterpillar's body. It has little eyes on its head, and a jaw that it uses for chewing. On the front part of its trunk, it has eight legs. When the butterfly is still in the form of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a caterpillar, it has no wings and its antenna are very short. Meanwhile, its salivary gland secretes a kind of silk. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A caterpillar does not become longer as it grows; it only puts on weight. Finally, the caterpillar breaks loose from its skin by gradual\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ly tearing it. This skin is quickly replaced by a skin more fitting to its fat body. Caterpillars are very delicious creatures for birds that feed on insects. For this reason, our Lord has taught caterpillars various defence techniques. When standing upri
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ht, some of them resemble a branch, some of them camouflage themselves by remaining on a leaf that is exactly the same colour as their bodies, while some others play dead. These defence techniques are vital for their survival. They remain alive and grow i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to butterflies, thanks to these defence techniques. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The caterpillar employs these camouflage techniques also when it grows into a butterfly. Butterflies live in regions that match their own colours. But how do butterflies check that their colour suits the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 environment since they are unable to see themselves? How can they be sure that they are secure? Certainly, they cannot know or consider any of these. Allah, their Creator, places butterflies in the most suitable place where they can be secure. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah is t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he "Merciful" and the "Protector", and, as a manifestation of these attributes, He gives many capabilities to living beings, so that they can protect themselves from danger. Otherwise, butterflies are bereft of the wisdom that would make them think that t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ey should protect themselves. Consequently, they themselves could never develop a defence mechanism such as camouflage. The One Who has created all these techniques that make life easy is our Lord, the One Who created the heavens and the earth and everyth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng between them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The caterpillar, which develops under the protection of the defence techniques given it by Allah, finally reaches the third phase. In this phase, it fills its stomach with as many leaves as possible so that it almost splits apart. In this
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  third phase, the caterpillar imprisons itself in a sack and the metamorphosis begins. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hard shell that is formed around the caterpillar in this phase is called a "chrysalis". In this shell, it is still and does not eat anything. In this phase, it util\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ises the energy of the leaves it ate when it was a caterpillar. Chrysalis shells are attached to a leaf, a rock or a branch. If you encounter one of them, have a look at it, because, when you look at the caterpillar inside the chrysalis, you can see the t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 aces of the proboscis and the limbs that will be formed on the butterfly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After approximately ten days, tearing its shell open in just a few minutes, the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At that time, the wings of the butterfly have not yet reached \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
their normal size. In the fourth phase, in order to stretch its wings, the butterfly inflates the veins of its wings with its body liquid. When its wings dry, it instantly begins to fly without any training. The wings also help the butterfly in its respir
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
As you see, even a tiny butterfly is a great miracle created by our Lord. Scientists have been conducting research to answer the question: "How does a caterpillar decide to change into a butterfly?" This metamorphosis only occurs because our Lord wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lls it so. Allah shows us how varied are the creatures He can create, and the unprecedented ways in which He can change them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another miracle is that the wings of butterflies are covered with tiny scales. The wings consist of these scales arranged one on t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 op of another. How do you think these wings have come into existence?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Have these scales accidentally come together and formed a wing with its perfect structure?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Have these scales spontaneously united to form a wing? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Has the butterfly himself stuck these s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cales to one another to form the wing? Did the butterfly himself attach this wing to its back?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A butterfly cannot see its back. But there are perfect symmetrical patterns on its back that it can never see. The scales are arranged in such an orderly manner \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that the patterns on both wings are exactly the same. If you measure the size of the patterns with a ruler, you will see that they are all equal. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of these show us our Lord's artistry, eternal knowledge and unlimited power. Upon seeing all these, we sh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ould reflect upon them and honour our Lord.

derwater world in which fish live. But, there is something we need to remember. Fish are not the only living beings inhabiting the underwater world. The underwater world harbours reptiles, insects and plants and shelters millions of kinds of creatures. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  creatures living in this world have particular methods of eating, breathing and sleeping peculiar to them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The respiratory system of fish is different from that of all other creatures. Instead of noses fish have gills. By means of gills, they can use the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 oxygen in water. The water that is continuously taken into the mouth passes through the gill arches. Meanwhile, capillaries in the gills take in the oxygen dissolved in the water and release the carbon dioxide of the body to the water. Most fish have nos
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rils but these are not used for respiration. The nostrils open to tiny sacs by which fish detect the odour of the water that fills these sacs. Sharks, for example, find their prey by means of their odours. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A fish does not have eyelids as do human beings. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
It looks at the world through a transparent curtain covering its eyes. This curtain resembles a diver's eyeglass. Since they usually need to see objects very close to them, fish's eyes have been created to meet this need. The spherical and hard structure 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f their eyes are adjusted to see objects close to them. When they want to look at an object at a distance, the lens system is drawn backward by means of a specific muscle mechanism in the eye.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Beside its five basic senses of sight, smell, hearing, touching and taste, the fish also perceives the outside world through its "lateral" lines. Sensitive nerves that lie along these lines perceive the size and direction of objects the fish passes by. In
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 this way blind cave fish can move very easily in the dark. This system is a kind of underwater radar or "sonar" system. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, many fish species have a long and slender balloon-like air-filled sac in the abdominal cavity. They maintain their balance\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  in the water with the help of this sac. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Fish of various kinds created by the will of Allah amaze people with their beautiful colours and movements. You can hardly find such vivid colours as those seen in many fish in any other animal. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You may be familia\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r with what has been described so far. But, there is another piece of information about fish which will astonish you. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Larger fish usually need tiny cleaner fish to cleanse them of parasites. Sometimes, these cleaner fish readily enter the mouth of a much \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
bigger fish without fear. They clean the teeth and gills of the host fish, a service in return for which the host causes them no harm.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, how can the cleaner fish be sure that the big fish will not suddenly swallow it? How does it know that the big fish\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 will not cause it any harm? How can it trust it? It is as if they had an agreement. Let's assume that there exists such an agreement; how could the little fish be sure that the host fish would not violate this agreement and eat it, once it renders its se
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 vices? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The truth is that the cleaner fish is always vulnerable to its host, but, because Allah has inspired both of them to co-exist, neither does the big fish cause harm to the cleaner fish nor does the little fish feel fear of the larger one. The large 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fish is cleaned while the little fish feeds on the parasites it cleans. By Allah's inspiration to them, both of them lead their lives in harmony and co-operation. }{\f0\insrsid16721650

\par }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The biggest inhabitants of the oceans are whales. The whale popularly known as "the blue whale"\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 weighs more than 150,000 kilograms (330,600 pounds) and is more than 30 metres (100 feet)long. To have a better grasp of the size of a whale, try to visualise a five-storey building: the blue whale is as long as a five-storey building is tall. Meanwhile,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 remember that this whale's weight equals the total weight of 25 to 30 elephants. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, how does such a giant animal manage to dive down to 800 to 1000 metres (around 2,625 feet)in depth and then resurface easily? For example, think of a ship of 150 tons (\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
330,600 pounds) and thirty metres (100 feet) in length. If this ship sank to the bottom of the ocean \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  that is 1000 metres (3,280 feet) in depth \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
 it would take a large-scale operation lasting years to re-float it. However, by the power that Allah has gra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ted it, a whale can rise to the surface in 15 to 20 seconds. Because the bones of the whale are made of a spongy substance filled with oil, the whale can easily remain on the surface of the water. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The whale is also a very skilful diver. Allah has created \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a body for it that is very resistant to the great pressure in the depths of the ocean. The oxygen circulating in the blood and muscles combines with chemical substances that nourish it underwater or at times it does not breath. It has a circulatory system
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
peculiar to it: it can send blood directly from the internal organs to the brain. This way, until the whale rises to the surface to breathe, it can send the oxygen in its body directly to the brain, the organ that needs oxygen most. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This magnificent syste\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m that amazes scientists is a manifestation of Allah's artistry. In this way, the whale can remain under the sea for more than 15 to 20 minutes without breathing. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, unlike human beings, whales aren't crippled by the bends when they rise very quick\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ly to the surface.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
You will probably ask what the bends are. The bends are a sickness that is caused after a rapid reduction in the surrounding pressure. When divers want to dive very deep underwater, they stop at certain points and make their body accust
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
omed to that pressure in order not to be affected by alterations in pressure. This way, they can reach very great depths slowly. But remember that they need to pause and rest at certain intervals during their return to the surface. Otherwise, due to press
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re differences, the veins of the diver suffer harm resulting in his death. Whales do not have such a problem, because, Allah has given living beings the features they need to survive in their particular habitats. Whales can live in oceans whereas human be
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ngs can live on land. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
You probably know that whales spray water from a hole on the top of their head. Do you know that this hole is actually a nose? The whale uses its nose only to breathe. Some people think that the whale only sprays water from this hole
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . The truth is, the whale releases the air in its lungs. Since this air contains water vapour and is hotter than the air outside, it is perceived as water from a distance.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The body of a whale is usually in the shape of a torpedo and is extremely suitable \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
for swimming in water. While the tails of other fish are perpendicular to the water surface, the tails of whales are horizontal and parallel with the water surface. By means of this tail, the whale pushes itself ahead in the water. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is a layer of fat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 approximately 50 centimetres (20 inches) under the skin of whales. The basic function of this layer is to maintain the body temperature at around 34 to 37 degrees Centigrade (93F to 98F). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this point, it might be useful to remind you about the followin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g: Contrary to the prevalent conviction, the whale and other fish do not drink seawater, because salty water is injurious to organisms. For this reason, they meet their need for water from the food they take in. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Each year in December and January, grey wha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
les departing from the North Sea migrate to the southern coasts of Northern America and reach California. Their purpose in migrating to warmer water is to give birth. What is interesting is that the pregnant mother eats nothing throughout this journey; ac
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ually, she does not need to. Throughout the long summer days, she feeds in the rich waters of the North, thereby storing more than enough energy for a long journey. As soon as the female whale reaches the coast of west Mexico, she delivers her baby. Baby 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hales feed on their mothers' milk and store as much fat as possible. This preparation makes them strong enough for migration, which is due to start in March. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Like other mammals, the whale also nurses her babies. But, the babies cannot suck milk since they\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 run the risk of swallowing seawater. As we mentioned before, salty seawater is injurious to whales. Interestingly, as with the dolphin, a muscle surrounds the milk glands of female whales. When the mother whale contracts this muscle, the resultant pressu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e enables the mother to spray the milk directly into her baby's mouth. This milk is dissimilar to the milk with which we are familiar. It is almost in a solid state and is quite fatty. Thanks to these features, the milk never mixes with the seawater. This
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 substance the baby drinks\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 in fact, "eats"\hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0 
dissolves in the stomach. This dissolved food also meets the water needs of the baby whale. As we have seen, Allah has provided baby whales with the most perfect nourishment. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The greasy, transparent secretion cove\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ring the eyes of the whale protects it from the harmful effects of the seawater. The whale has a keen sense of touch and hearing. It finds its direction in water by following the echoes of the sounds it makes. The working principle of this sense is simila
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to that of radar. In fact, this feature of whales has become the inspiration for the development of radar. Scientists believe that these sounds made by the whales constitute a very complex language. This language is important in the interaction and commu

\par }{\f0\insrsid9850004\charrsid5189086 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let's think about what we have learned so \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
far about animals. From the white ewe that recognises her baby from its odour to the zebra that has a distinctive pattern and symmetry, you have learned many things about animals. However, the most important knowledge this book has provided you is that it
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is Allah Who has granted all these features to these animals. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As all the examples throughout the book have shown, Allah, the Creator of all living beings on earth, has also taught them how to survive. Sometimes, Allah gives some of this information to the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 living beings at birth.

For example, while you are reading these lines, you know that you have to keep your eyes open. But for you to see, it does not suffice to know that you need to keep your eyes open. Your eyes have to perform many operations at the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
same time. You may liken this to a computer game; to start the game, you need only to push the start button, which is a command that starts many complex operations in the computer. Meanwhile, what happens to you is that you sit on your comfortable chair a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d enjoy the game. Just as a computer could not have come into existence spontaneously, so it is with the components forming the eye. As is the case of all other beings, it is Allah Who has created our eyes and bodies flawlessly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Our Lord, the Owner of inf\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 inite knowledge, has presented you all your physical features at birth, which makes a healthy life possible. That is why, we ought to be grateful to Him for these gifts.

es deeper and he reveres His might and power more. Actually even a single feature of a creature immediately reminds us of Allah. Not only living beings, but also everything surrounding us and all events that take place provide concrete evidence of Allah's
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 existence. This important fact is stressed in a verse as follows:}{\f0\insrsid9850004
