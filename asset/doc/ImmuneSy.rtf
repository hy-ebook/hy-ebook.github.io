The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. 
He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very
 important works disclosing the forgery of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies. 
\par 
\par His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author\rquote 
s books has a symbolic meaning linked to their contents. This se
al represents the Qur'an as the last Book by God and the last word of Him and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of disbe
lieving ideologies and to say the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 

\par 
\par All
 these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to people and thus to encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to remind them of some im
portant issues. 
\par 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries such as India, America, England, Indonesia, Poland, Bosnia, Spain and Brazil. His books have been translated into many languages, and English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu
, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian versions are available. 
\par 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a 
deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their fe
a
tures of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. The explanations provided in the books are undeniable, explicit and sincere, and enrich the reader with definitive answers. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a seriou
s
 thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this proves to be only a sentimental insistence since these books refute these ideo
logies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par 
\par There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity endowed them by God. T
he author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, the author makes no material gains from his books. Neither the writer, nor those who are instrumental in publishin
g and making these books accessible to the reader, make any material gains. They merely serve to earn the good pleasure of God.

\par Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate books which create confusion in people's minds, lead people into ideological chaos, and which clearly have no strong an
d precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to put the stress on author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. T
hose who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has rendered are manifest in the reader's conviction. 

\par 
\par O
ne point needs to be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals Muslims undergo is the ideological prevalence of lack of religion. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of lack of 
f
aith and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it i
s clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par 
\par It is no exaggeration to say that the Harun Yahya series have assumed this leading role. By the Will of God, these books will be the means through w
hich people in the 21st century will attain the peace and bliss, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par The reason why a special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, durin
g
 the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service b
e rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par 
\par In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the l
ight of the Qur'anic verses and people are invited to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plai
n
 and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality
 are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par 
\par This book and all the other works of the author can be read individually or discussed in a group at a time of conversation. Those readers who are w
illing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in the sense that they will be able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation
 and reading of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the books of the author are extremely convincing. For this reason, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods 
is to encourage them to read these books.

ility. As a nation, it must be in a constant state of preparedness to face all kinds of threats and dangers from external and internal sources. No matter how well developed and advanced a country may be, if it fails to defend itself, it could be brought t
o
 ruin with the launching of even a minor military offensive against it, or even a well-directed and unanticipated terrorist act. In the face of such threats, neither its natural resources, its technological prowess, not its economy will be of any avail. I
f the country in question is unable to defend itself, it may even cease to exist.
\par This is one of the reasons why significant amounts of the national income is regu
larly allocated to defence; nowadays, armed forces have to be provided with the most advanced weaponry, tools and equipment fitted with the latest technological features, and meticulous training has to be given to soldiers in an all-out attempt to keep de
fence systems fully functional.
\par  No less than countries, people too have to be concerned about their defence, if they want to lead a healthy and peaceful life. They inevitably have to protect themselves and their possession against criminal acts, such as th
eft and murder, as well as against natural disasters, such as accidents, fire, earthquakes and floods.
\par But this is not the end of the matter. Human beings have other enemies, which go unseen by them and, as such, are often ignored. Actually, these enemies 
are much more resilient than the others. Serious measures must, therefore, be taken to guard against them.
\par Who, or what then these enemies that keep human beings under constant threat?
\par They are bacteria, viruses, and similar microscopic organisms, which may exist in the water we drink, the food we eat, the house we live in, and the office where we work. In essence, they are everywhere.
\par Most interestingly, in spite of being surrounded by such a serious threat, we make no effort whatsoever to protect ourselve
s against it. This is because there is a mechanism within our bodies, which undertakes this task on our behalf, providing the necessary protection for us, without causing us the slightest disturbance. This is "The Defence System". 
\par It is one of the most im
portant and amazing systems operating within our bodies, for it undertakes one of the most vital missions of life. We may not be aware of it, but all the elements of the immune system protect our bodies just like the soldiers of a huge army. The defence c
e
lls that protect the human body against invaders, such as bacteria, viruses, and similar micro-organisms, are equipped with extraordinary abilities. The patterns of intelligence, effort, and sacrifice, which these cells display during the war they wage in
 the body, astonish everyone who learns about them. 
\par People in general would like to know what makes them ill, how illnesses take complete control of their bodies, what causes fever, fatigue, pain in their bones and joints, and which processes take place in their bodies throughout their illnesses.
\par The main purpose of this book is to explore how this system, which protects the human body just like a disciplined, organized army, has come into being and how it works. 
\par These two points will lead us to very important conclusions. First, we shall together witness the uniqueness and the perfection in Allah\rquote 
s creation. Second, we shall observe what contradictions the theory of evolution, a superstitious belief having no verification whatsoever, includes within its own reasoning, and on what an unsound basis it was erected. 
\par Before proceeding to the main topic, it will be useful to state another important point: In books on the immune system, you will often see statements such as:
\par "We do not yet know how this formed\'85"
\par "The reason still remains unknown\'85"
\par "Research on the topic is under way \'85"
\par "According to a theory\'85"
\par These statements are actually important confessions. These are expressions of the helplessness people experience at the outset of the 21st century \emdash  even with all the latest technology and accumulated knowledge at their disposal \emdash 
 in the face of the miraculous work these tiny cells accomplish. The tasks achieved by these microorganisms include such intricate operations that the human mind can barely grasp the
 details of this well established system. There is obviously a secret wisdom hidden in the immune system which eludes man\rquote s understanding. 
\par As you read this book, you will witness the superiority of this wisdom, hidden both in your cells and in other details pertaining to your body. The ultimate conclusion is that this could only be the wisdom of a supreme "Creator". 
\par Science may one day succeed in solving all the secrets of the immune system and even produce a similar artificial system by imitating the act
ions of these cells. No doubt, this task will require highly educated professionals using the most sophisticated technology and instruments available, working in highly advanced laboratories. The most important point here is that the accomplishment of suc
h a task would once again invalidate the theory of evolution, proving that such a system cannot originate by coincidence. 
\par The likelihood of the spontaneous development of a mechanism such as the defence system currently seems too remote. As scientists unra
vel the secrets of this system, they are enthralled by the design they encounter. The points that are revealed lead to many other questions, which make the wisdom and consciousness in the cell all the more apparent. Therefore, it has become very clear tha
t the defence system, like all the other systems in the body, could not have developed gradually, just by chance, as suggested by the theory of evolution. 
\par The main purpose of this book is to introduce you to these "brave warriors" within you, while also pr
oving to you that this mind-boggling system is a special sign of creation. In relation to this, we will see how the scenarios formulated by the theory of evolution are demolished and rendered meaningless when faced with the facts. The topic which will be 
p
articularly highlighted here, is not the biological details of the defence system, which are easily accessible in any book of biology or medicine, but the miraculous aspect of the system. We have especially avoided the unnecessary use of biological and ph
ysiological terms in order to make the contents of the book easily understandable to readers of all ages and professions. 
\par Lastly, we want to remind you that even now, you are totally indebted to your defence system if you are able to read this book peacefu
lly, without being infected by the microbes all around you. Had the immune system not existed in your body, you would never have been able to read this book, having left this world even before you learned reading and writing.

into the astounding details of the war of defence fought in the innermost recesses of our bodies, we must first have a general look at the defence system and its elements. 
\par Briefly, the defence system may be defined as "an extremely disciplined, hard-worki
ng and organized army that protects the body from the clutches of external enemies." In this multi-faceted war, the main duty of the elements fighting in the front line is to prevent the enemy cells, such as bacteria or viruses, from entering the body. 

\par Al
though it is not easy for the enemy organisms to enter the body, they exert themselves to the utmost to reach their ultimate goal of invading the body. When they successfully do so, after overcoming various obstacles such as the skin, and the respiratory 
a
nd digestive tracts, they will find tough warriors waiting for them. These tough warriors are produced and trained in specialized centres such as the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. These warriors are "the defence cells" referred to as the m
acrophages and lymphocytes.
\par First, various types of phagocytes, which are called the "the eater cells" will swing into action. Then the macrophages, another specific type of phagocytes, take their turn. They all destroy the enemy by engulfing it. Macrophage
s also perform other duties such as summoning other defence cells to the battleground, and raising the body temperature. The rise in temperature at the onset of a sickness is very important, for the afflicted the person will feel fatigued by it and need t
o rest, thus reserving the energy needed to fight against the enemies. 
\par If these elements of the immune system prove insufficient against the enemies penetrating the body, then lymphocytes, the champions of the system, come into play. Lymphocyt
es are of two types; B cells and T cells. These are again further divided into sub groups.
\par The helper T cells are next in reaching the battleground after the macrophages. They may be considered the administrative agents of the system. After the helper T cells identify the enemy, they warn other cells in order to initiate a war against it. 

\par Thus alerted, the killer T cells come into play to destroy the besieged enemy.
\par The B cells are the armaments factory of the human body. Following their stimulation by the helper T cells, they immediately start to produce a sort of weapon called the "antibody". 
\par After the alarm is over, suppressor T cells stop the activity of all defence cells, and therefore prevent the war from lasting any longer than is necessary. 
\par Howeve
r, the mission of the defence army has not yet ended. The warrior cells, called the memory cells, store necessary information about the enemy in their memories and keep it for years. This will enable the immune system to mount a quick defence against the 
same enemy at later meetings with it. 
\par There are many more incredible factors hidden in the details of the defence system, which we have very briefly outlined above. As mentioned before, in this book, these extraordinary events are told in an easy-to-understand way.

Around 250 years ago, scientists discovered, after the invention of microscope, that we live together with many tiny creatures, which we cannot see with the naked eye. These creatures are present everywhere \emdash  from the air we
 inhale, to the water we drink, to any object which comes in contact with the surface of our body. It was also discovered that these creatures penetrate the human body. 
\par Although the existence of this enemy was discovered two and a half centuries ago, most
 of the secrets of the "defence system" that fights a vigorous war against it have not yet been uncovered. This molecular system in the body is activated automatically according to an exquisite plan the minute a stranger makes its way in, declaring an all
-out war against it. When we take a quick look at how the system works, we see that every phase takes place according to a meticulous plan.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 Whether we are aware of it or not, millions of operations and reactions take place in our bodies every second. This action continues even when we are asleep. 
\par This intense activity occurs in periods of time which from our viewpoint are very short. There is
 a significant difference between the notion of time in our daily lives and the biological time of our body. The span of one second that represents a very short time period in our daily life would pass for a very long time for many working systems and org
ans in our bodies. If all the activities performed by all the organs, tissues and cells of our body in one second were written down, the result would be so inconceivable as to push the limits of the human mind. 
\par One vital system, which is involved in consta
nt activity, never shirking its duty, is the defence system. This system protects the body from all kinds of invaders day and night and works with great assiduity, just like a fully-equipped army for the host body, which it serves. 
\par Each system, organ, or group of cells within the body represents a whole within a perfect labour distribution. Any defect in the system ruins the order. And the defence system is indispensable.
\par Would we be able to survive in the absence of the defence system? Or what sort of life would we have if this system failed to fulfill some of its functions?
\par It is not hard to make a guess. Some examples in the world of medicine make clear how vital the immune system is. The story of a patient cited in many related sources shows how difficult life would be in case of any defect in the defence system. 
\par This patient was placed immediately after his birth in a sterile plastic tent, which nothing was allowed to penetrate. The patient was forbidden to touch any other human being. As he grew up, h
e was placed in a larger plastic tent. He had to wear a specially designed outfit similar to an astronaut\rquote s to get out of this tent. What prevented this patient from living a normal life like other people? 
\par Following his birth, the patient\rquote s defence system had not developed normally. There was no army in his body to protect him from the enemies.
\par The boy\rquote s doctors were well aware of what could happen if he entered normal surroundings. He would immediately catch a cold, causing diseases to develop in his thro
at; he would suffer from one infection after another, despite being given antibiotics and other medical treatments. Before long, medical treatment would lose its effect, resulting in the death of the boy.

 claims. A human being without a defence system, or with a malfunctioning one, would shortly die as seen in this example.

eedless to say, such a castle, which is surrounded by countless enemies, must be protected in a very complete and organized manner. Human beings are created along with this perfect protection they need, and are not, therefore, entirely defenceless against
 these enemies. The "micro" guards in our bodies never leave us alone and fight for us on many fronts.

 is full of amazing features. Its ability to repair and renew itself, its non-permeability by water, despite the existence of tiny pores on its surface as opposed to its function of discharging water through perspiration, its extremely flexible structure,
 
allowing free movement, as opposed to its being thick enough to avoid easy rupture, its ability to protect the body from the heat, the cold, and harmful sunrays are only a few of the features of the skin that have been specially created for human beings. 
H
ere, we will deal with a particular feature of this extraordinary wrapping paper: its ability to protect the body from disease-causing micro-organisms. If the body is considered a castle besieged by enemies, we can safely refer to the skin as the strong w
alls of this castle. 
\par The main protective function of the skin is realized via the dead cell layers constituting the outer section of the skin. Each new cell produced by cell division moves from the inner section of the skin towards the surface. While doing
 this, the liquid element (cytoplasm) of the cell interior transforms into a resistant protein known as keratin. During the process, the cell dies. The newly formed keratin substance has a very hard structure and is not therefore subject to decomposition 
by digestive enzymes, which is a sign of its resistance. Thus, invaders such as bacteria and fungi will be unable to find anything to rip off from the outer layer of the skin. 
\par Moreover, dead outer cells containing keratin are constantly shed from the skin surface. The new cells that come from beneath to replace the discarded ones form an impenetrable barrier in that area. 
\par The organisms on the skin fulfill another protective function of the skin. A group of harmless microbes live on the skin, which have ada
pted to its acidic medium. Feeding on the leftovers stuck on the keratin of the skin, these microbes attack all kinds of foreign bodies to protect their feeding site. The skin, as the host of these microbes, is like a supplementary force that provides ext
ernal support to the army within the human body.

One of the courses our enemies take to enter our body is the respiratory tract. Hundreds of varied microbes, which are present in the air we inhale, try to gain entry to the body th
rough these passages. However, they are unaware of the barrier set up against them in the nose. 
\par A special secretion in the nasal mucous retains and sweeps out about 80-90% of the micro-organisms that gain entry to the respiratory system directly or through dust particles or other substances. 
\par In addition, the tiny hairlike structures (cilia) on the surface of the cells of the respiratory tract beat upward, causing a current that carries foreign particles to the throat where they are swallowed and disposed 
of by acid in the stomach. The coughing reflex and sneezing facilitate this function. 
\par The microbes that are able to surmount these barriers and reach the alveoli (lung, bronchus and gingiva) will be ingested by phagocytes. After this phase, phagocytes bec
ome mobile and drift upwards with the microbes they have ingested to be finally discharged from the body in different ways.

Another vehicle by which microbes gain entry to our body is our food. However, the guards of our body, which are aware of this me
thod used by the microbes, await them in the region where the food finally ends up, which is the stomach. They also have a surprise for the arriving microbes, which is the gastric acid. This acid is quite an unpleasant surprise for the microbes which have
 overcome all obstacles and reached the stomach. The majority, if not all, of the microbes are defeated by this acid. 
\par Some microbes may overcome this obstacle because they have not made enough contact with the gastric acid, or they have showed resistance. 
However, these microbes are again subjected to further conflicts with other guards situated on their way. Now, another surprise is at hand for them: the digestive enzymes produced in the small intestine. This time, they cannot get away as easily.

y cells, which have never been out of the body, and therefore, have no chance of examining the chemical make-up of the microbes outside, and which, moreover, have not received any training in chemistry?
\par Definitely not. Only Allah, Who created both the external world, and the food in this world, and the body that needs these foods, and the system to digest these foods, is able to create such a defence system.

\par These groups of micro-organisms, which are gathered in certain parts of the body, are called the normal microbial flora of the body. They do no damage and even have some benefits for the human body. 
\par These micro-organisms provide external support for the defence army against microbes. They benefit the body by preve
nting foreign microbes from settling in it, because the entry of any microbe into the body is a threat to their own housing site. Since they do not want to be displaced by the invaders, they fight a fierce battle against them. We can think of these micro-
organisms as "professional soldiers" fighting for the body. They try to protect the site they live in for their own benefit. In so doing, they complement the fully equipped army in our body. 
\par How do these "professional soldiers" settle in our bodies?
\par The human embryo has met no enemy during the gestation period in the mother\rquote

y tract. Some of these microbes die right away, while others are discharged before having the chance to settle down in the body. Some, however, settle in various parts of the body such as the skin, skin ridges, mouth, nose, eyes, upper respiratory tract, 
digestive tract, and genital organs. These microbes form permanent colonies at these locations and constitute the microbial flora of the human body.

\par This organism, whose existence
 we became aware of with the invention of the electron microscope, is too simple-structured and small to be considered even as a cell. Viruses, which vary in sizes ranging from 0.1 to 0.280 microns, are excluded from the world of living things for this re
ason.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7827491 2}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 
\par Although categorized as being apart from the world of living beings, viruses indisputably possess at least as exceptional abilities as all other living beings do. A closer examination of the lives of viruses will make this fact more apparent. Viruses
 are the compulsory parasites of living beings. This means, they cannot survive if they do not settle into a plant, animal, or human cell, and consume its food and energy. Viruses do not have a system that would enable them to survive on their own. As if 
they are aware of this, they deftly slip into a cell, and after invading the cell, with the same deftness turn the cell into a "virus production factory" that produces its own copies. 
\par This plan developed by the virus to invade the cell is extremely sophist
icated and intelligent. In the first place, the virus must determine whether the cell is appropriate for itself or not. It has to be very careful and meticulous in this decision, for the smallest mistake may cause its death. To avoid such an end, it uses 
its special receptors to check whether the cell is appropriate for it or not. The next important thing it does is to carefully locate itself within the cell.
\par The virus confuses the cell with the tactics it employs and avoids observation. 
\par This is how the ev
ents develop: the cell transports the new DNA of the virus into its nucleus. Thinking that it produces protein, the cell starts to replicate this new DNA. The DNA of the virus hides itself so furtively that the cell involuntarily becomes the production fa
ctory of its own enemy and produces the very viruses that will eventually destroy it. It is indeed very difficult for the cell to identify the hereditary make-up of the virus as that of an invader. 
\par The virus locates itself within the cell so well that it a
lmost becomes a part of it. After the multiplication process is over, the virus and other new viruses depart from the cell to repeat the same process in other cells. During the process, depending on the type of the virus and the cell, the virus can kill t
he host cell, cause harm to it, modify it, or simply do nothing. 
\par The question of how the cell, which operates under a very strictly monitored control mechanism, can be deceived into becoming a virus factory is still unanswered. It is quite intriguing that 
viruses, which have a highly specialized structure, but which are not even classified as living beings, could act so intelligently, think up, and plan such effective strategies. The secret of this phenomenon lies in the existence of a Creator, Who created
 these organisms with the abilities they possess. 
\par The features of the virus are perfectly designed to enable it to make use of the system operating in the cell. It is obvious that the power that created the virus is also well informed about the extremely c
omplex working principles of the cell. This power belongs to Allah, Who created the virus and the cell into which it will settle, as He created the entire universe. 
\par The virus, which, with its miniscule structure, can inflict and sometimes even cause the death of the human body, which is millions of times bigger than itself in size, is a being specially created by Allah to remind people of their weaknesses.

Antibodies are protein-structured weapons, which are manufactured to fight against the foreign cells entering the human body. These weapons are produced by the B cells, a class of warriors of the immune system. 
\par Antibodies destroy invaders. They have two main functions: The first is to bind to the invader cell, which is the antigen. The second is to decompose the biological structure of the antigen and destroy it. 
\par Swimming in the blood and non-cellular fluid, antibodies bind to disease-causing bacteria and viruses. They mark the foreign molecules to which they bind, so that the body\rquote 
s fighter cells can distinguish them. This way, they also inactivate them. This resembles a tank becoming useless and unable to move or fire shells when it is hit by a guided mi
ssile in the battleground. An antibody fits the enemy (antigen) perfectly, just like a key and a lock assembling in a three-dimensional structure. 
\par The human body can produce a compatible antibody for almost every enemy it encounters. Antibodies are not of
 one type only. According to the structure of every enemy, a specific antibody powerful enough to deal with it is produced. This is because an antibody produced for one disease may not be effective on another. 
\par Manufacturing a specific antibody for each en
emy is rather an unusual process, which deserves closer attention. This process can be realized only if the B cells know their enemies and their structures very well. There are, however, millions of enemies (antigens) in nature. 
\par This is like manufacturing a compatible key for each of millions of locks straight away. What is important is that the manufacturing agent does this without examining the lock or using any mould. It knows the formula by heart. 
\par It is quite difficult for a human being to memorize the shape of even a single key. So, is it possible for a person to keep in mind the three-dimensional designs of millions of keys that are to open millions of locks? 
\par Definitely not. However, a B cell so small as to be imperceptible by the eye keeps millions of bits of information in its memory, and uses them in correct combinations in a conscious way.
\par The storage of millions of formulae in a miniscule cell is a great miracle presented to man. No less miraculous is the cell\rquote s using this information to protect man\rquote s health.

We have previously stated that antibodies are a type of protein. So, let us first examine the structure of proteins. 
\par Proteins are made up of amino acids. Twenty different types of amino acids are arranged in different seq
uences to form different proteins. This is similar to making different necklaces by using beads in twenty different colours. The main differences among proteins are due to the sequence of these amino acids.
\par Yet there is an important point to remember: Any error in the amino acid sequence makes the protein useless, and even harmful. Therefore, there is no room for even the smallest error in the sequence. 
\par So, how do the protein factories in the cell know in which sequence to arrange the amino acids they cont
ain, and which protein to produce? The instructions for each of the thousands of different types of proteins are encoded in the genes found in the genetic data bank in the cell nucleus. 
\par Therefore, these genes are required for the production of the antibodies which are a type of protein. There will be need for
\par There is a very important miracle here. There are only one hundred thousand genes in the human body compared to the 1.920.000 antibodies that are produced. This means that nine hundred thousand genes are missing. 
\par Then how is it ever possible that such a small number of genes can produce antibodies about ten times their value? The miracle is revealed at this point. The cell combines the hundred thousand genes it contains in different combinations to fo
rm new antibodies. It receives the information from some genes and combines it with the information in other genes and makes the required production according to this combined information. 
\par 1,920,000 different antibodies are formed as a result of 5,200 different combinations.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7827491 4}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 
 This process represents a wisdom and planning that are too great for the human mind to comprehend, let alone design. 
\par An unlimited number of combinations can be made with the use of one hundred thousand genes. The cell, however, uses,
 with great intelligence, only 5,200 basic combinations and produces 1,920,000 specific antibodies. How has the cell learned to make the right combinations out of these unlimited possibilities to form the required antibodies?
\par Making the correct combinations out of an infinite number of possibilities aside, how has the cell got this idea of making combinations?
\par Moreover, the produced combinations serve a certain purpose, and aim to produce an antibody that would eliminate the antigen that enters the body. Therefore, the cell also knows the properties of the millions of antigens entering the body. 
\par No intellect in this world can produce a design of such unparalleled perfection. But cells only the size of a hundredth of a millimeter can do so.
\par So, how has the cell learned such a special system? 
\par The truth is that no cell has the opportunity to "learn" a biological function in the real sense. This is because the cell does not possess the ability to perform such an act at birth, nor has it the cha

does it have the time to learn them, as this would cause it to fail in stopping the antigens entering the body and the body would lose the war.

\par Eventually, the antibody you will produce has to have a special and unique shape at one end. Only then can it bind to an antigen.
 The other end of it has to be similar to other antibodies. This is the only way the antigen destructing mechanism can be activated. As a result, one end has to be standard, while the other has to be different from the others (which come in more than one 
million different types). 
\par Human beings, however, have been unable to design an antibody, despite all the technology at their disposal. The antibodies produced in the laboratory environment are either derived from antibody samples taken from the human body,
 or the bodies of other living beings.

We earlier stated that antibodies are a type of protein. These proteins, functioning in the defence of the body within the immune operation, are called "immune globulin" (a type of protein) and designated as "Ig". 
\par The most characteristic proteins of the defence system, the immune globulin molecules bind to the antigens to inform other immune cells of the existence of the antigen or to start the destructive chain reactions of the war.

IgG is the most common antibody. Its development takes only a few days, while its life span ranges from a few weeks to several years. IgGs circulate in the body and are mainly present in the blood, lymphatic system, and intestine. They circulate
 in the bloodstream, directly target the invader, and latch on to it as soon as they detect it. They have a strong antibacterial and antigen-destroying effect. They protect the body against bacteria and viruses, and neutralize the acidic property of toxin
s (poisons). 
\par Additionally, the IgG may squeeze itself between cells, and eliminate the bacteria and micro-organic invaders that have infiltrated to the cells and the skin. Due their above-mentioned ability and small size, they can enter the placenta of a p
regnant woman and protect an undefended foetus against possible infections. 
\par If antibodies were not created with this characteristic which permits them to penetrate the placenta, the unborn child in the mother\rquote s womb would be unprotected against microbes. 
It would be under the threat of death even before it was born. For this reason, the antibodies of the mother protect the embryo against the enemies until the time of birth. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 IgA (Immune Globulin A):}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491  These antibodies are present in sensitive regions where t
he body fights with antigens such as in tears, saliva, mother\rquote s milk, blood, air sacs, mucus, gastric and intestinal secretions. The sensitivity of those regions relates directly to the tendency of bacteria and viruses to prefer such damp mediums. 

\par IgAs, w
hich are structurally quite similar to each other, settle in those regions of the body where microbes are most likely to enter, and they keep this area under control. This is like placing reliable soldiers on guard at strategically critical points. 

\par The antibodies, which protect the foetus from various diseases in the mother\rquote 
s womb, do not abandon the newborn following their birth, but continue to guard them. All newborn babies do need ongoing assistance from the mother, because there are no IgAs in the org
anism of a newborn baby. During this period, the IgAs present in the milk the baby sucks from its mother protect the baby\rquote 
s digestive system from the effect of many microbes. Just like IgGs, this antibody class also disappears after they have fulfilled their term of service, when the baby is a few weeks old. 
\par Have you ever wondered who sends you these antibodies that try to protect you from microbes, when you are in the form of an embryo and unaware of anything? Is it your mother or your father? Or is it th
at they have taken a common decision and sent you these antibodies together? Certainly, the help in question is out of the control of both parents. The mother is not even aware that she has been endowed with such an aid plan. The father is just as unaware
 of all that is going on. 
\par Then why do the cells present in the mother\rquote s breast and productive of these antibodies function in such a way? Which power has told these cells that the newborn needs antibodies? It is by no means a coincidence that the cells eng
aging in antibody production for the baby are located in the place where the newborns suckle. 
\par Here, there is another very important miracle. Antibodies are protein-structured organisms. Proteins, on the other hand, are digested in the human stomach. There
fore, normally, the baby suckling milk from its mother would digest these antibodies in its stomach, and would become unprotected against microbes. The stomach of the newborn baby, however, is created in such a way that it does not digest and destroy thes
e antibodies. The production of protein-digesting enzymes is very little at this stage. Therefore, antibodies vital for life are not digested and they protect the newborn baby from its enemies. 
\par The miracle does not end here. The antibodies, which are not broken down by the stomach, can, however, be absorbed by the intestine as a whole. The intestinal cells of the newborn are created in such a way as to do so. 
\par Unquestionably, it is no coincidence that these miraculous events are arranged in such a sequence.
 The human body, a meticulously planned example of creation, passes from the embryonic stage to having a fully functional immune system in a perfectly phased manner. This is because the events that are supposed to take place in the body every day, every h
our and every minute, are computed in an extremely finely-tuned manner. Certainly, the author of this precise calculation is Allah, Who creates everything according to a very intricate plan.

\par An unborn child can produce IgMs in the sixth month of gestation. If an enemy ever attacks the baby in the mother\rquote s womb, for example, if it infects it with a microbial disease, the baby\rquote

\par - There is full harmony between the antigen and the three dimensional antibody, which is produced for that specific antigen, just as a key exactly fits a lock. 
\par - The cell, when required, arranges the information it possesses in a conscious way and produces different antibodies. 
\par - While doing all this, it displays wisdom and planning far beyond the boundaries of the human mind\rquote s comprehension. 
\par - Certain antibodies, which are specially placed in the mother\rquote s milk, meet the antibody need of a baby, which is as yet unable to produce these antibodies. 
\par - The baby\rquote s stomach does not digest the antibodies, but spares them so that they serve the baby\rquote s body.

\par How do people who blindly believe in evolution explain the existence of such a perfect system? The answer is very simple: they cannot.

\par Unable to explain even the working principles of these control and combination mechanisms, evolutionists evade the issue by saying that "this system brought itself into being" whenever it serves their purpose. They do not attempt to describe how 
such an incredible system developed by itself as a result of coincidences. When they try to bring some explanations of their own to these issues, they cannot put forward anything but fabricated and ridiculous scenarios. By doing so, they expose their weak
ness, and the unreasonableness of the claim they make. 
\par So great is the wisdom displayed in these control mechanisms that approximately two million differently structured products are fabricated from thousands of combinations of units of information. Yet, a
s mentioned before, neither the cell, nor any system within the cell has the ability to "learn" and "develop". Moreover, the cell makes these information combinations by selecting only the right ones out of infinite possibilities. Therefore, this requires
 a much more conscious and reasonable selecting. mechanism.
\par Those who make such a claim may well advance the following theories for any given product that is manufactured by technology or the human mind: 
\par "Stone tablets created themselves and later developed into computers on their own.". Or,
\par "Kites that have created themselves later developed into jet planes." 
\par The above sentences would sound absolutely absurd to any national person. However, even these sentences are much more logical than saying that the e
lements of the defence system, the working principles of which have not even been discovered, emerged by coincidence. 
\par What is more, the presence of antibodies alone is not sufficient to protect the human body. For the defence system to operate, and for th
e human being to survive, macrophages, helper T cells, killer T cells, suppressor T cells, memory cells, B cells and many other factors must work in cooperation.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 Another wondrous element of our defence system is the spleen. The spleen is made up of two parts: red pulp and white pulp. The fresh lymphocytes produced in the white pulp are first transferred to the red pul
p and then join in the blood stream. A detailed study of the operations carried out in this organ, which is dark red in colour and located high up the abdomen reveals an extraordinary picture. Its quite difficult and complicated functions are what make it
 so wonderful and extraordinary. 
\par The duties of the spleen, such as contributing to cell production, phagocytosis, conservation of red blood cells, and immunity construction, are at least as important as they are difficult. Certainly, the spleen is a lump o
f meat just like all our other organs. Yet it displays a performance and a degree of intelligence unexpected from a lump of meat. It organizes everything, not allowing any problems to occur, and works without rest. Indeed, the spleen works strenuously for
 the human from the moment of his birth, and continues its function as long as Allah wills.

\par No. At this stage, the spleen comes into play and takes control. Sensing that the body needs red blood cells, thrombocytes, and granulocytes, the spleen starts to produce these cells in addition to lymphocytes, which is its main duty. 
\par The spleen, however, is an unconscious lump of meat. It is not capable of assuming such a resp

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 The spleen contains a large number of macrophages (cleaner cells). These engulf and digest old and damaged red blood cells, some damaged blood cells and some substances that are carried to the spleen through the blood. 
\par There is a very important chemical recycling system at work here. 
\par The macrophage cells in the spleen convert the haemoglobin protein, which is fo
und in the composition of the red blood cells they have engulfed, to bilirubin, a bile pigment. Then, the bilirubin is released to the venous circulation and sent to the liver. In this form, it can be discharged out of the body along with the bile. Howeve
r
, the iron molecule found in the bilirubin which is about to be discharged out of the intestines along with the bile, is a rare material which is very valuable for the body. For this reason, iron is absorbed back in a certain region of the small intestine
s and from there, it first goes to the liver and then to the bone marrow. Here, the purpose is both to discharge the bilirubin, which is a harmful substance, and, at the same time, to regain the iron. 
\par The bilirubin balance is crucial for our body. This is 
because even the slightest problem in this system would lead to serious outcomes. One of the best examples is that when bilirubin goes above a certain level, jaundice develops in the body. However, the cells in our body, as if they are aware of this dange
r, discharge the harmful materials from our body with a great precision while they select the useful ones among them and put them into use once again.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 In the human body, there is a police force and a police intelligence organization scattered throughout the body. In this s
ystem, there are also police stations which have policemen on guard, and which produce new policemen when required. 
\par This system is the lymphatic system and the police stations are the lymph nodes. The policemen of the system are lymphocytes. 
\par The lymphati
c system as it stands is a miracle performed for the benefit of mankind. This system comprises of lymphatic vessels that are diffused throughout the body, lymph nodes that are located at certain spots on these vessels, the lymphocytes produced by lymph no
des, which patrol in the lymphatic vessels, and the lymph fluid circulating in the lymphatic vessels in which lymphocytes swim. 
\par The system works as follows: The lymph fluid in the lymphatic vessels spread throughout the body makes contact with the tissues 
located around the capillary lymphatic vessels. The lymph fluid that returns to the lymphatic vessels right after this contact brings along some information about these tissues. These pieces of information are transmitted to the nearest lymph node located
 on the lymphatic vessels. If any hostile action has started in the tissues, its knowledge is forwarded to the lymph node through the lymph fluid. 
\par In case any danger is sensed following the examination of the nature of the enemy, an alarm is given. At this point, the rapid production of lymphocytes and some other warrior cells starts in the lymph nodes. 
\par After the production stage, the new soldiers are transported to the front where the battle is fought. These new soldiers will travel from the lymph nodes t
o the lymphatic vessels through the lymph fluid. The soldiers, which are diffused into the blood stream from the lymphatic vessels, finally reach the battleground. This is why the lymph nodes in the infected region swell first. This shows that the lymphoc
yte production has increased in that region. 
\par Now, let us summarize the system: 
\par - A special transportation system that covers the length and breadth of body. 
\par - Lymph node stations dispersed throughout different regions of the body. 
\par - The intelligence operation directed at the enemy cells. 
\par - Production of soldiers according to the results of the intelligence report. 
\par It is impossible for this system, which would collapse in the absence of even one of its elements, to have originated by developing graduall
y over time. For instance, a system with lymph nodes and lymphocytes, but without lymphatic vessels, would not be of any use. The system can work properly only if all its elements are created simultaneously.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 If an enemy over
comes all barriers and succeeds in entering our body, this does not mean that the defence army has been defeated. On the contrary, the real war has just begun, and the main soldiers come into play at this stage. The first soldiers to meet the foe are the 
eater cells, that is, phagocytes, which continuously travel in our body and keep control of what is going on.
\par These are "special cleaning cells", which ingest the unwanted microbes that have penetrated the inner surfaces of the body, and alert the defence system when necessary. 
\par Certain cells in the defence system capture, break down, digest, and eliminate the miniscule particles and liquid foreign matter that have entered our body. This event is called "phagocytosis". (cell engulfing)
\par Phagocytosis is one of the most important elements of the immune system. It provides an immediate and effective protection against infections. 
\par Phagocytes, considered the "police forces of the body," can be examined under two separate headings. 
\par 1. Mobile police forces: These roam in the blood and shuttle forwards and backwards between the tissues when required. These cell units, which circulate throughout the body, also serve as scavengers. 
\par 2. Immobile police forces: These are immobile macrophages, which are situated in the gaps in various tissues. They perform phagocytosis on the micro-organisms from where they are, without moving. 
\par If the invader antigens (foreign micro-organisms) are few enough for the present eater cells to deal with, they are destroyed with no extra alarm 
being given. But if the invader microbes are too great in number, the eater cells may fail to get them under control. Unable to digest all of them, they expand in size. When distended by the antigens, the cells burst, causing a liquid substance (pus) to o
v
erflow. This does not mean that the war is lost. So far, the eater cells have just met the microbes, which have still many tougher barriers to pass. The formation of pus activates the lymphocytes, which have been delivered from the bone marrow, the lymph 
nodes, and above all, the thymus. In a second wave of defence, the newly arriving defence cells attack everything they find around, including cell debris, available antigens, and even old white blood cells. These defence cells are the real eater cells, 
\emdash  the macrophages, a type of phagocyte.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 When the war becomes intense, the macrophages swing into action. Macrophages operate in a specific manner exclusive to themselves. They do not become involved
 in a one-to-one combat like the antibodies. Unlike the antibodies, they do not work with a system similar to a bomb aimed at a single target. Just like a gun firing lead shot, or a bomb that can be aimed at many targets together, the macrophages can dest
roy a great number of enemies together, all at the same time. 
\par Like all other defence cells, the macrophages are also derived from the bone marrow. The macrophages, which have a very long life span, can live for months, and even years. Despite their small s
ize (10-15 micrometers), they are highly crucial for human life. They possess the ability to absorb and digest big molecules in the cell through phagocytosis (ingestion). 
\par Their characteristic of ingestion makes them the scavengers of the defence system. T
hey remove all materials that need to be cleaned up, such as micro-organisms, antigen-antibody complexes, and other substances similar in structure to an antigen. At the end of these processes, substances that would be qualified as antigens are digested, 
and thus pose no further threat to the organism.

e needs of this extraordinary situation and the country is involved in an all-out war effort. Similarly, the defence system would also announce mass mobilization, recruiting all of its elements to fight the enemy. Do you wonder how this happens? 
\par If enemy members are more than the currently fighting macrophages can handle, a special substance is secreted. The name of this substance is "pyrogen" and it is a kind of alarm call. 
\par After traveling a long way, "pyrogen" reaches the brain where it stimulates the f
ever-increasing centre of the brain. Once alerted, the brain sets off alarms in the body and the person develops a high fever. The patient with a high fever naturally feels the need to rest. Thus, the energy needed by the defence army is not spent elsewhe
r
e. The pyrogen produced by the macrophages is perfectly designed to trigger the fever-raising mechanism of the brain. Therefore, the macrophage, and the pyrogen, and the temperature-raising centre of the brain, and the brain have all to be created at the 
same time. 
\par As is evident, there is a perfect plan at work. Every requirement is created flawlessly for this plan to succeed; the macrophages, the pyrogen substance and other similar substances, the fever-raising centre of the brain and the fever-raising me
chanisms of the body\'85
\par In the absence of even one of these, the system would simply not work. Therefore, it can by no means be claimed that such a system could have originated step by step through evolution. 
\par Who, then, has made this plan? 
\par Who knows that the body\rquote s fever must rise, and that only that way the energy needed by the defence army will not be spent elsewhere?
\par Is it the macrophages?
\par Macrophages are merely tiny cells invisible to the naked eye. They do not have the capacity to think. They are living organisms that only obey an established superior order; they merely carry out their duties. 
\par Is it the brain?
\par Definitely no. Nor does the brain possess any power to create or produce something. Just as in all other systems, in this system, too, it is in a position not to give orders, but to obey orders and submit to them. 
\par Is it man?
\par Certainly not. This system protects man from certain death, although he is not even aware that such a perfect system is at work in his own body. Even if man were ever ordered
 to develop an army in his own body to fight the enemy and cause his fever to rise, and provide this army to work round the clock in his entire body, he would simply have no idea what to do. 
\par Today, mankind is not even able to understand the details of the present order in the defence system, despite all the technology at its disposal \emdash  much less imitate it.

The lymphocytes are the main cells of the defence system. The intense war in the body can only be won with the strenuous efforts of the lymphocytes. The life stories of these cells are full of incredibly interesting and wonderful stages, each of which, st
anding alone, is enough to demonstrate the decrepit nature of the theory of evolution. 
\par These bold warriors are present in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, salivary glands, spleen, tonsils and joints. The lymphocytes are primarily present and produced in the bone marrow. 
\par The formation of lymphocyte in the bone marrow is one of the most mysterious events of biology. Here, stem cells rapidly pass through a number of biological stages and take on a completely new structure by turning into lymphocytes. (A stem cel
l is an unspecialized cell that gives rise to a specific specialized cell, such as a blood cell.) When it is considered that, despite the great developments in genetic engineering, the transformation of even the plainest microbe species into other similar
 
species is considered impossible, the mystery of this event, which takes place in the bone marrow, becomes even greater. This mystery, unsolved by science to date, is a very simple process for our body. For this reason, many evolutionist scientists have c
o
nfessed that natural selection or mutation tales cannot account for the mystery in such a transformation. Prof. Dr. Ali Demirsoy stated that a complex cell like the lymphocyte, which carries almost all the responsibility of the war, could not have evolved
 from a simple cell:

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 Lymphocytes, the products of this mysterious transformation, which is one of the facts ignored, play a very interesting role in the defence sys
tem. They check on the body cells several times a day to see if there are any sick cells. If they find any sick or old cells, they destroy them. There are almost 100 trillion cells in our body and lymphocytes make up only 1%. 
\par Now, imagine a country having an exceedingly high population, around 100 trillion. The number of health care workers (lymphocytes) would then be 1 trillion. If we think that the world\rquote 
s current population is some 7 billion, the number of the people living in our imaginary country would be almost 14 million 285 thousand times the world\rquote 
s population. Would it be possible for all the members of a country with such a high population to have a check-up one by one, and moreover, several times in the same day? 
\par You will surely say no, but this process is carried out in your body every day; lymphocytes roam throughout your body several times a day to do a health check. 
\par Is it possible to attribute the extremely organized operation of such a great mass of living beings to coincidence?
\par Can coincidences account for each one of a trillion lymphocytes assuming such an arduous and demanding task?
\par Certainly not!
\par Allah, the Lord of all Worlds, created each one of these one trillion lymphocytes and charged them with the responsibility of protecting man. 
\par Lymphocytes play a very important role against major infectious diseases such as AIDS, cancer, rabies and tuberculosis, and serious ailments such as angina and rheumatism. Of course, this does not mean that lymphocytes do not have any role to play with ot
her diseases. Even the common cold is nothing but a combat fought by the lymphocytes to keep those very dangerous common cold viruses away from the body.
\par The human body can defeat many of its enemies by using antibodies. This may lead you to wonder why lym
phocytes intervene in the war directly when they already make a considerable contribution by producing antibodies. However, some microbes are so deadly that very strong chemical toxins are needed for their removal. Therefore, some lymphocytes use these ch
emical toxins and directly participate in the war. 
\par How then would the defence system stop these enemies?
\par First, chemists and a laboratory would be needed to produce the toxin. The structure of the required material is too special to be formed by coincidenc
e. Allah, Who knows that the human body will face such an enemy, or rather, Who created such an enemy for man to take warning, has also given the lymphocytes to synthesize this toxin.
\par So, is this chemical material satisfactory? 
\par No, because this substance cannot freely circulate in the blood, as this would mean the death of our own cells as well. 
\par How then will this toxin be used without causing any harm to our cells?
\par The answer to this question is hidden in the perfection of the creation of the lymphocytes
. Toxins are placed in sacs located in the cell membrane of the lymphocytes. This helps the chemical weapon to be used easily. The lymphocyte injects this toxin only when it contacts the enemy cell, eventually killing it. 
\par The lymphocytes come in two types: B cells and T cells.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 The cells undergo a highly complex and laborious process to become B cells. These cells must first pass a severe test in order to become the warriors who will protect human health. 
\par In their initial phase, the B cells rearrange the gene fragments that will form an antibody mole
cule. These genes are actively transcribed as soon as the rearrangement is complete. At this point, it is very important to note how a tiny cell can perform complex tasks such as arranging and transcription. What is arranged and transcribed is actually in
formation. And information can be arranged and organized only by a being who possesses intelligence. Furthermore, the outcome after the arrangement is extremely important: this information will later be used in the manufacture of antibodies. 
\par The transforma
tion of B cells rapidly goes on. Upon an order coming from an unknown source, cells produce proteins called "alfa" and "beta", which surround the cell membrane. At a further level, a range of complicated processes are due to take place in the cell to enab
l
e it to produce some molecules that will enable it to bind to antigens. At the end of all these complicated operations, the cells turn into a factory that recognizes the enemy as soon as it makes contact with it, and is able produce millions of different 
weapons.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 The more we delve into the details of the defence system, the more miracles we encounter. As stated before, B cells manufacture antibodies. Antibodies are weapons that are manufactured purely
 to cause harm to enemy cells. So, what happens if the weapons produced by the B cell confuse their targets and start to hit friendly cells?
\par In that case, the other cells send a signal inside the B cell. This signal is actually an order for the cell to "co
mmit suicide". Eventually, some enzymes in the nucleus of the cell are activated and they decompose the DNA of the cell. A perfectly working auto-control mechanism protects the body, and finally, only the B cells that produce antibodies that cause harm to
 the enemy can stay alive. 
\par Only comprised of a compact nucleus and very little cytoplasm initially, the B cells undergo unbelievable changes when they meet an antigen. They divide repeatedly and build up thousands of assembly points in their cytoplasm for 
the manufacture of antibodies, as well as an extensive channeling system for the packaging and exporting the antibodies. One B cell can pump out more than 10 million antibody molecules an hour. 
\par Here is a single cell that transforms itself into a factory c
ompetent enough to produce 10 million weapons an hour on meeting an enemy. If we remember that this cell can produce different weapons for each of its millions of enemies, we can better understand the scope of the miracle in question here.
\par Some B cells become "memory cells". These cells do not immediately participate in the body\rquote 
s defence, but keep molecular records of past invaders in order to accelerate a potential war in the future. Their memory is very strong. When the body meets the same enemy again, t
his time it is rapidly geared to the appropriate weaponry production. Thus, defence becomes faster and more efficient. 
\par Here, we cannot help asking ourselves: "How can man, who considers himself the most advanced being, have a memory weaker than that of a tiny cell?"
\par Unable to explain even how the memory of a normal human being forms and works, evolutionists never attempt to explain the existence of such a memory as a matter of evolution. 
\par If a lump of flesh the size of a hundredth of a millimeter had only 
one single piece of information, and used this information for the benefit of mankind in the most accurate way, even this would be a miracle in its own right. However, what we are referring to here goes far beyond that. The cell stores millions of pieces 
of information for the benefit of man and uses this information accurately in combinations beyond man\rquote s comprehension. Man is able to survive thanks to the wisdom these cells display.
\par Memory cells are cells specially created to protect man\rquote s health. Allah e
quipped them with strong memorizing ability by design. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the cell to develop a strategy on its own accord and give itself within this strategy the responsibility for storing information. Moreover, the cell is even unawa
re of such a need; much less does it feel the need to employ such a strategy.
\par In addition, there is another important question that needs to be answered about the strong memories of the memory cells. In a normal human being, eight million cells die every se
cond to be replaced by new ones. Therefore, the metabolism continuously renews itself. Yet the life span of memory cells is much longer than the life span of other cells. This characteristic helps them to protect people from diseases thanks to the informa
t
ion in their memories. These cells, however, are not everlasting. Though a long time later, they eventually die. At this point, we are left with a very surprising situation. Memory cells transfer the information they possess to the next generation before 
they die. People are indebted to these memory cells for not having to be afflicted all over again by the same in diseases they caught in infancy (measles, mumps, etc.). 
\par How then can this cell know that it has to transfer this information?
\par This surely cannot be attributed to the cell itself, but to the ability granted to it by its Creator.

h is as important as destroying and marking foreign cells. It is about how so many antibodies can be produced by a limited number of genes. 
\par As outlined in detail in the section on "Antibodies", the B cells use the genes in the human body to manufacture ant
ibodies. However, the number of genes in the human body is less than the number of antibodies produced. This situation causes no problem for the cells. Despite all these limitations, they succeed in producing nearly 2 million antibody types an hour.}{

\par A stem cell would normally be expected to divide to form two new cells bearing the same features. However, a 
switch hidden in one of the cells is turned on causing a sudden transformation in the cell. This new cell is the T cell that will fight for the human body. This leads us to ask the following question:
\par Why does a cell transform itself into a totally different cell?
\par Science has not answered this question yet. Science can answer the question of how the cell transforms itself, but it can never explain why the cell would want to become a fighter cell. Nor can it explain who programmed the cell to become a cell t

e cells can be regarded as the administrators of the system. In the initial stages of war, they decipher the properties of the foreigner cells absorbed by the macrophages and other antigen catcher cells. After they receive the due signal, they stimulate k
iller T and B cells to fight. This stimulation causes B cells to produce weapons called antibodies. 
\par Helper T cells secrete a molecule called lymphokine to stimulate other cells. This molecule somehow turns on a switch in other cells and starts off the war alarm. 
\par The ability of the helper T cell to produce a molecule, which activates another cell, is a very important process.
\par First, the production of this molecule is related to an impending war strategy. It is obvious that the cells cannot make up this strategy themselves, nor can the strategy come about by sheer coincidence.
\par Developing a strategy would not be enough either. The molecule in the cell, which will switch on the production key in the other cell, should be synthesized accurately. For this, it has
 to be perfectly aware of the chemical structure of the opposite cell. 
\par A mistake made in the production of this molecule alone would paralyze the defence system entirely. This is because an army without communication would be destroyed even before it launched its defence. 
\par The existence of this molecule alone suffices to prove the absurdity of the theory of evolution. This is because the prerequisite of the system is the existence of this molecule right from the outset. If helper T cells failed to alert ot
her cells with the help of this molecule, the human body would surrender to viruses.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 The killer T cells are the most efficient elements of the defence system. In previous chapters, we have studied how viruses are inactivated by proteins ca
lled antibodies. There are cases, however, when antibodies cannot reach out to a virus which has invaded a cell. On such occasions, killer T cells kill the sick cell which is invaded by the virus. 
\par A closer examination of how killer T cells kill sick cells would reveal a great wisdom and an artistry in creation. 
\par The killer T cells first have to distinguish between normal cells and those in which invaders hide. They deal with this problem with the help of the innate system (MHC molecules) granted to them. W
hen they locate the invaded cell, they secrete a chemical substance. This secretion sinks into the membrane of the cell forming a hole by lining up sideways in close formation. Following this, leaking starts in the cell which is full of pores, and the cel
l dies. 
\par Killer T cells store this chemical weapon in granular form. This way, this chemical weapon is always kept ready for use. Scientists were amazed to discover the fact that the cell produces its own weapon by itself and stores it for future use. Even 
more amazing are the details in the mind-boggling way the cell uses this chemical weapon.
\par When an enemy approaches the host cell, these microgranules move to the tip of the cell in the direction of the enemy. Afterwards, they come in contact with the cell 
membrane, melt into it, and by extending towards the outside, they release the substance contained within them.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 These lymphocytes, which are produced in the bone marrow, are also available in the spleen, lymph node, and the thymus. Their most important functions are killing tumour cells and virus-carrier cells. 
\par From time to time, invader cells take very sinister courses. They sometimes hide so well in body cells that neither antibodies nor T cells recognize the enemy. Everythin
g seems usual from the outside. In such cases, the defence system somehow suspects an anomaly and "NK" cells rush to that region through the blood. Killer lymphocytes surround the cell and start to push the cell around. At that stage, the enemy cell is ki
lled by a toxigenic substance injected inside it. 
\par How these cells identify the enemy is yet another unanswered question about the defence system. The receptors that should be present on their surfaces to enable them to identify of the target cells have not
 yet been discovered. Therefore, the mechanism they employ in identifying the enemy has not yet been clearly understood. 
\par Despite all the technology at its disposal, mankind has still not been able to solve the details of the system these cells use to iden
tify the enemy. Perhaps future technological advances will throw light on this system and this subject will no longer be a mystery. This, too, would be a piece of evidence proving the perfection of the current system, and what an intricate plan is involve

 definitely needs further consideration. It knows that the T cells defend the human body, identify the enemy and present the enemy it captures to the T cells for them to provide intelligence about it. 
\par Why would the cell do this? According to the theory of evolution, this cell should be concerned only about its own well-being. However, it serves the system, although it receives no benefit from it. 
\par What is even more interesting is that the APC are very well aware of the require
ments of the T cells. Based on this, the APC will break down the enemy cell and present to the T cell only the amino acid sequence. This means that the APC is even aware that the T cell will extract the required information from this sequence.
\par At this poin
t, it would be useful to recall one thing: We mentioned actions such as "knowing", "calculating", "thinking", "serving". Unquestionably, those actions require a certain consciousness. It is virtually impossible for a being with no consciousness or will to
 perform these actions. Yet, here we are talking about these abilities as being inherent in these minuscule entities: common, tiny, unconscious cells. Therefore, who gives this consciousness, ability, and a glorious system to these cells?
\par The answer to this question is very evident. It is Allah Who creates the APC and the T cell, as well as all other cells in the body, in a harmonious way to serve in the same system.

fence system, its organs, cells, and enemies. In this chapter, we will explore the deadly warfare between our defence system and enemy cells, and the wonderful defence our body mounts. 
\par The brave battle fought by of our defence system is comprised of three important stages: 
\par 1. Identification of the enemy, first action. 
\par 2. The attack of the real army, all-out war. 
\par 3. Retreat to a normal state. 
\par The defence system has to clearly identify the enemy before it starts the fight. This is because each engagement
 differs from the other depending on the type of enemy. Moreover, if this piece of intelligence is not properly handed on, our defence system may inadvertently attack the body\rquote s own cells. 
\par The phagocytes, known as the scavenger cells of the defence system, take the first action. They fight hand-to-hand with the enemy. They are just like infantrymen who fight with bayonets against enemy units. 
\par Sometimes, phagocytes cannot catch up with the increasing numbers of the enemy, at which point big phagocytic cell
s, macrophages cut in. We can liken the macrophage to cavalrymen cleaving their way through the middle of the foe. At the same time, macrophages secrete a fluid, which sets off a general alarm in the body to increase the body temperature. 
\par Macrophages have
 yet another important characteristic. When a macrophage cell captures and engulfs a virus, it tears off a special portion of the virus, which it carries on itself like a flag. This serves as a sign for the other elements of the defence system as well as 
an item of information. 
\par Once the gathered intelligence is forwarded to the helper T cells, by the help of which they identify the enemy, their first task is to immediately alert the killer T cells, stimulating them to multiply. Within a short period, the s
timulated killer T cells will become a formidable army. This is not the only function of the helper T cells. They also ensure that more phagocytes arrive at the battlefront while they transfer the gathered intelligence relating to the enemy to the spleen 
and lymph nodes. 
\par Once the lymph nodes receive this information, the B cells, which have been waiting for their turn, are activated. (The B cells are manufactured in the bone marrow and then migrate to the lymph nodes to wait for their turn to be of service). 
\par The activated B cells go through a number of stages. Every stimulated B cell begins to multiply. The multiplication process continues until thousands of identical cells are formed. Then, the B cells, which are ready for war, start to divide and are tra
nsformed into plasma cells. Plasma cells also secrete antibodies, which will be used as weapons during the fight with the enemy. As stated in earlier chapters, B cells are capable of producing thousands of antibodies in a second. These weapons are very ha
ndy. They are capable enough to bind to the enemy first, and then to destroy the biological structure of the enemy (antigen). 
\par If the virus penetrates the cell, the antibodies cannot capture the virus. At this point, the killer T cells come into play again and, by identifying the viruses in the cell with the help of MHC molecules, they kill the cell. 
\par However, if the virus has been successfully camouflaged, escaping even the notice of killer T cells, then "natural killer cells", briefly called NKs, swing int
o action. These cells destroy the cells which host viruses in them, and which are imperceptible to other cells. 
\par After the victory is won, suppressor T cells stop the war. Although the war is over, it is never to be forgotten. Memory cells have stored the 
enemy in their memory. Staying in the body for years, these cells help the defence to be faster and more effective if the same enemy is encountered again. 
\par The heroes of this war have not received any military training. 
\par The heroes of this war are not human beings able to reason. 
\par The heroes of this war are cells so minuscule as to hardly cover a full stop when they come together in millions. 
\par Moreover, this amazing army does not engage in fighting alone. It manufactures all the weapons it will use during the war; it makes all war plans and strategies itself, and cleans up the battleground after the war. If all these processes were left in the 
control of man, and not cells, would we ever be able to handle such a feat of organization?

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 People do not immediately realize that microbes or viruses are invading their bodies. Only whe
n the symptoms of their illness surface do humans become aware of them. This is proof that a virus, a bacterium, or a similar micro-organism has long ago settled within their body. This means that the primary intervention has resulted in failure. Such unc
hecked conditions could cause the disease to progress considerably, resulting in irremediable dispositions. Even if the person has been infected with a curable and relatively simple disease, delayed response may result in a serious crisis, or even death. 

\par N
ow, let us imagine that the coordination and control of the elements of the defence system and the ensuing strategies to be developed and implemented, the overseeing of the war itself were all left to human beings. What sort of difficulties would we confr
ont?
\par Let us assume that the initial symptoms were effectively diagnosed. When foreign cells enter the human body, immediately the warrior cells must be manufactured and then sent to the area of conflict. The B cells must immediately commence the production 
of the weapon (antibody). How are we to determine the type and location of these foreign cells? This is a significant point, as future treatment depends on this initial stage. To do this, the only solution for the person would be to have a medical check-u
p
 which covered all the organs of his body down to every drop of his blood at the slightest suspicion of invaders having entered the body. Otherwise, it would be impossible to determine the type and location of the antigens. The long time needed for such a
 process would undoubtedly cause a serious delay in timely intervention. It is evident how troublesome and distressful life would be for people if they had to go to the doctor\rquote s to undergo such a check-up on the merest hint of infection. 
\par Let us suppose tha
t timely intervention was possible and the type and location of antigens could be identified precisely. Depending on the type of the enemy, first the phagocytes have to be activated. How can phagocytes be directed to rush to the exact location? What kind 
o
f a message would help them to locate the enemy easily? Let us suppose that the impossible became the possible. Then comes the time to learn whether the phagocytes have won the war or not. Depending on the result, either the macrophages will be launched o
r
 the war will be stopped. No doubt, the only possible solution lies with visiting the doctor again and having a thorough check-up. If the war has not been won, the secondary forces, that is, the macrophages, must be sent to the area of conflict. Meanwhile

 the time spent on the check-up would work against us. Without losing any time, the macrophages have to tear a piece off the enemy and warn the helper T cells. The helper T cells will in turn warn the killer T cells, thus initiating another struggle. Thes
e cells, too, must be checked on as to whether they are successful or not \emdash  for which, again, a doctor\rquote s help is needed \emdash 
 and then the NK cells must be called in for assistance. After a final examination, it will be determined if the defence system has been effective in defeating the infection. 
\par If man were asked to control only his defence system and nothing else, he would have to be involved in such a complicated and difficult process. Even a simple common cold would require him to go to the doctor\rquote s many 
times over, follow up the recovery course of the cells with extremely advanced medical equipment, and direct them as necessary. Even the slightest delay or a problem in the course of the process would cause the illness to be further aggravated. 
\par What if man were asked to form these cells, make them recognize the enemy and manufacture the appropriate antibodies, then teach and organize all the processes they would perform \'85
 Unquestionably, such a life would be far more troublesome and distressful than the aforementioned model. It would literally be impossible. 
\par Allah has taken the burden of this process away from humans, creating a faultless system to work in the most immaculate and independent manner ever imaginable. Just like everything else in the universe
, our defence system, too, has obeyed its purpose of creation to become an indispensable, critical element of life:

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 We have explored in previous chapters how the defence system 
distinguishes between friendly and hostile cells with the help of the receptors. However, the building blocks of some hostile cells are almost identical to those of certain tissues in the human body. This represents a significant problem for the defence s
ystem, which might conceivably attack some of its own tissues accidentally. 
\par Under normal conditions, though, such a response never happens in a healthy human body. The defence system never attacks a molecule, cell, or tissue of its own. In medical terms this phenomenon is referred to as "tolerance".
\par This constitutes an extremely important miracle. We can clearly see that the defence system is fully capable of differentiating between thousands of proteins. For example, the defence system must distinguish the
 haemoglobin found in blood from the insulin secreted by the pancreas and from the vitreous humour contained in the eye, and indeed, from everything else in the human system. The defence system knows that while it fights a merciless war against foreign mo
lecules, it must not harm any tissues belonging to the human body.
\par For many years, researchers have tried to understand how the defence system has learned to be tolerant towards its own tissues. Yet, details concerning why the most important lymphocytes, na
mely, the T and B cells, do not attack the human body have only been revealed in the last 20 years. The tolerance process, only a small portion of which mankind has been able to discover as the result of years long research, has been in operation since th
e human being came into existence. 
\par How then has the defence system possessed the ability to distinguish the various different structures from each other? Can this be the result of unconscious coincidences as the theory of evolution suggests? It is certainl
y impossible for structures made up of unconscious atoms to coincidentally acquire this selection ability that requires such consciousness, information and intelligence. 
\par When specially designed structures of lymphocytes enabling them to make the right choise is investigated, it will be understood how illogical and unreasonable the claim of evolutionists is. 
\par A defence cell developed within the bone marrow or the thymus would be killed or inactivated if it reacted to the products of the body. A mature lymphocyte faces the same consequence in case it attacks the body\rquote 
s own products. That is to say that any element of the defence system likely to harm the body is either killed or forced to commit suicide obeying the command it receives. 
\par However, if a T cell i
s confronted by another body cell, it does not attack but rather inactivates itself. Similarly, if there is any substance in the body that carries antigen properties which should not, however, be destroyed, the human body does not produce any antibodies a
nd so does not attack it.
\par If we consider the fact that our body contains around 1 trillion lymphocytes, we can appreciate the miraculous discipline required to ensure that these cells only target enemy cells and spare friendly cells.

 to develop. However, despite this negative scenario, the embryo is not as vulnerable as we might assume. After it is formed, it succeeds in fully developing over an extended period of 9 months, completely protected against the intended attacks
 of the antibodies. 
\par How then is this achieved?
\par There is a barrier surrounding the embryo specially created to absorb only the nutrients in the blood. This barrier helps the embryo to take up the necessary nutrients for its development, while isolating it from the destructive effect of antibodies.

\par Otherwise, the antibodies would immediately attack the embryo (considered as a foreign substance) and destroy it. The isolation of the embryo from the antibodies with such a special protection is one of the most perfect examples of creation in the mother
\rquote s womb.
\par Neither mutation, nor natural selection nor any other so-called evolutionar
y mechanism could have incorporated such perfect creation in the evolution tale. The miracle of creation is self-evident. In the Qur'an, Allah states that He placed the embryo in a secure repository:

lled, this would not happen either. Such disorders are created for a hidden cause for people to clearly comprehend how temporary and incomplete the life of this world actually is. Were it not for the existence of a variety of diseases and illnesses, human
s
 would be likely to forget how helpless they were against Allah Who created them. They might fail to remember that no matter how advanced technology is, their recovery, as well as their life, depend on the will of Allah alone. They may continue to live as
 
if they will remain in good health forever, as if they will never meet death and be called to account for their actions in the presence of Allah on the Day of Judgment. They may live on without reflecting on the plight of those who are sick, deprived and 
o
ppressed. Therefore, they may fail to appreciate that their health is a blessing from Allah and that they should live their lives in the most favorable and productive way. People of this sort, however, hardly ever accept these facts, which we have listed 
a
bove. Illnesses make people accept them in a flash. It is not until then that people start to think about things that never occurred to them before, such as their helplessness and incapacity against the power of Allah, the fact that technology, which deve
l
oped by the will of Allah, can again only be of any use by His will; they think of those people in need, of death, and depending on their illness, even the stage beyond death. Only then do people appreciate their health. Furthermore, they witness the unde
pendability of the life of this world, to which they were blindly devoted and committed with all their existence; this causes them to re-assess whether they have worked enough for the hereafter, their true abode.
\par Indeed, our true abode is not this world, bu

In most general terms, cancer can be characterized as uncontrolled cell replication. Regardless of its type, cancer initially develops in a normal, healthy cell and shares the basic characteristics of this normal cell, at least in its
 early developmental stages. However, these cells tend to lose some of their abilities. One such important ability is that of reacting to the messages delivered by their surrounding or their own organisms that regulate cell replication. When such a disord
e
r occurs, the cell can no longer control its replication and the growth of tissues. This process, known as "continuous dividing," is genetically transferred to new cells resulting in the spread of tumours, which in turn invade the neighbouring tissues. Th
e
se decomposed cells eat up the nutrients of other cells, consuming the vital amino acid supply. Cancer cells eventually shut down the passages within the human body with their expanding volume. They accumulate in various organs such as the brain, lungs, l
iver, and kidneys, surrounding the healthy and normal cells of these organs and preventing their normal functioning, eventually posing a serious threat to human life.
\par Normal cells replicate only when they receive a command from neighbouring cells. This is a
 safety measure within the organism. However, cancer cells do not respond to this mechanism and refuse any control over their replication system. The type of cancer described so far does not create any problem for the defence system. A strong body with an
 
effective defence system is capable of struggling with the increasingly expanding cancerous cells multiplying in number, and of even defeating the disease. The main problem arises when cancer cells pierce their own membranes with the help of an enzyme (pa
c-man enzyme), and mix in the circulatory system (the conveyor network) of the body by penetrating the lymphatic fluid, and eventually reaching distant tissues and cells. 
\par The current scenario is quite negative. Cells that used to work collectively in provi
ding humans with the gifts of seeing, hearing, breathing, and living suddenly grow recalcitrant, not obeying the "stop" command they receive from neighbouring cells. As they continue replicating, they carry out a destruction process at full blast which le
ads to the total death of the body. 
\par If we compare the human body to a country and the human defence system to a powerful, fully equipped army, the cancer cells emerge as the rebels of this country. This mutinous community grows in number daily, continuing 
their demolition of the current structure. But the army of this country is not at all pregnable. 
\par The macrophages, the front line warriors of the defence system, surround the invader when they encounter it and destroy the cancer cells with the help of a pr
otein they specially produce. In addition, the T cells, the strong and intelligent warriors of the defence system and their exceptional weapons (antibodies) kill the cancer cells that have begun to fuse in the body and lymphatic fluids by piercing the cel
l membrane. The struggle will continue even as the cancer spreads. As the cancer cells develop further, the defence cells help to inhibit the progress of the disease, resulting in remission.
\par One of the systems within human cells which prevent the spread of cancer cells is "apoptosis", which causes the suicide of the cell. Apoptosis is seen when the DNA of the cell is damaged, or a tumour develops, or the effectiveness of the P53 gene \emdash 
 also known as the "cancer preventing gene" \emdash  lessens. Though apoptosis ma
y appear to be a very negative event, it is actually highly important, as it blocks such vital disorders and prevents the disease from passing on to the next generation. When compared to the potential danger imposed by the cancer cells, which are likely t
o damage the entire human body, the loss of a single cell is much more acceptable. Cells within the human body that realize (!) that there is a disorder in their own structure threatening the human body instigate their own demise to prolong human life.

\par The 
cancer takes on a life-threatening form when these decomposed cells overcome this suicide system. In this case, a second defence mechanism is activated to avoid uncontrolled multiplying of these cells. If they succeed in surpassing this barrier, too, they
 
then encounter a further stage known as the "the term of crisis". At this stage, the cells, which have successfully escaped from the previous security systems, are killed en masse. Among these cells, one cell, however, succeeds in overcoming the "crisis".
 This "rebellious" cancer cell will transfer its rebellious nature to its descendants, which will multiply in great numbers. The cancerous patient must now fight an intensive struggle with cancer.
\par Is it only the uncontrolled, independent and continuously multiplying nature of the cancer cell that brings victory to it? Other reasons lie behind this success. 
\par Cells carry a type of inscription system on their surface which positions them in the body. This inscription system is decipherable by all the cells with
in the human body, helping each cell to know exactly where it belongs and preventing it from occupying another\rquote 
s place. This system ensures the integrity of the tissues. Cells, which are aware of their position, neither go anywhere else, nor let any other 
cell occupy their place, thus ensuring the maintenance of the body in a healthy state. Cells that are not located at a certain site or those located at an inappropriate site will eventually commit suicide. However, with the help of this system, the suicid
e
 process is totally eliminated, as the cells are not allowed to be dislocated or located in an inappropriate site. This process is not as simple as it may seem. In order to maintain the effective functioning of this system, each cell has to identify its o
w
n position whilst respecting the locations of other cells, and being mindful not to invade their sites. These procedures are taught to them by various mediator molecules which enable these cells to maintain their respective places. However, there are occa
s
ions when these mediator molecules are absent or unable to fulfil this duty. This provides the cancer cells with an advantage. When inhibitory molecules are not present in the environment, cancer cells spread more rapidly. Besides, cancer cells are not re
quired to anchor themselves to any specific site. They undermine the rules by living independently and without settling in any place.
\par Erythrocytes are exceptional cells that do not possess a stationary site within the human body. They pierce the membranes o
f other cells and tissues and tear down the obstacles with the aid of a special enzyme called "metallo-proteinase". They are therefore able to visit any part of the human body at will. The defence cells use this enzyme to reach out to the enemy cells, whi
le cancer cells use them for an entirely different purpose. Their main goal is to attack healthy cells and invade them.
\par The skills of the cancer cells are not limited to these pursuits; they are also capable of playing other \lquote games\rquote  against the defence cell
s. Odd as it may sound, we are not talking about talented actors but rather cancer cells, which play games against their opponents. Before attempting to explain these unbelievably clever games, let us review what we have explained so far. 
\par Isn\rquote 
t it extraordinary that our army of defence sets up progressive barriers against the enemy? This organization we call an "army" is made up of cells which can only be viewed under an advanced electron microscope. Their ability to protect and guard their si
t
es, their willingness to lay down their own lives to save the life of the human body they belong to, their unyielding commitment to continue their struggle, are not the products of coincidence. Undoubtedly, we can see a very conscious and well-organized f
orm of functioning in defence cells. 
\par What would happen if such a difficult mission were handed to a trillion highly educated humans beings? Would the success rate be as impressive? Would it be possible for them to enforce their will on the crowd despite th
e existence of strict disciplinary rules and obligatory measures? If a few of these individuals forgot the formula of the antibodies they were supposed to manufacture, or neglected to manufacture them, or refused to commit suicide when necessary, would al
l
 of these stages function regularly? Would the struggle end with victory? Could an army of billions of individuals continue its struggle without any mistake? Are there, by any chance, any brave and skilled commanders or managers who would be willing to un
d
ertake the responsibility of keeping these billions under control? However, our defence cells do not need any commanders or managers. Their system operates in a very regulated manner, without any inhibitions or difficulties. There is no anarchy or confusi
o
n during the process. The reason for this perfection and extremely effective functioning is Allah, Who established this system down to its minute details and inspired the elements of this system to fulfill their responsibilities. In the 5th verse of Surat
 al-Sajda, it is stated: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 "He directs the whole affair from heaven to earth."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 It must not be 
forgotten that cancer cells are original body cells that carry the molecular character of the human being. In consequence, it is difficult for the defence cells to identify cancer cells. Furthermore, cancer cells manage to win over some antibodies by a me
thod undiscovered to date. 
\par As we have mentioned, antibodies are a type of protein that stops the activities of enemy cells. However, for some unknown reason, cancer cells are adversely affected by the antibodies. Instead of stopping, their activities incre
ase, resulting in the rapid and forceful spreading of the tumour.
\par Antibodies, which bind themselves on to the surface of the cancer cell, "collaborate" with the cancer cell in a sense. Other antibodies do not touch a cancer cell having an antibody attached to it. Hence, the cancer cell is perfectly camouflaged. 
\par Collaboration between antibodies and cancer cells can reach even broader dimensions. There are also occasions where cancer cells combine with antibodies to form "pseudo supressor T cells". These pse
udo suppressor T cells misinform antibodies by relaying the message that there is "no danger". More sinister situations also develop whereby the cancer cells develop into "Pseudo Helper T cells" instead of the pseudo suppressor T cells. In such situations
, the message is delivered to a bigger number of antibodies. There can be no more convenient environment possible for the development of cancer cells.
\par Additionally, cancer cells may sometimes spread "trap antigens" in order to protect themselves from a poss
ible attack by the defence system. These tumours spread out such large amounts of antigens from their surface that the blood stream is inundated with them. These antigens, however, are fake and cause no harm to the human body. However, the antibodies are 
not aware of this and they respond without delay by instigating a war against them.
\par During this chaos, the real and dangerous cancer cells continue to function, going undisturbed and undiscovered by the enemy.

 time to come. Unlike other viruses, this micro organism totally inactivates the defence system. It is impossible for a human being with a malfunctioning defence system to survive. 
\par The HIV virus causes irreversible damages to the human body by causing the 
defence system to collapse, making it vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, eventually giving rise to various fatal conditions. It has occupied researchers for many years, resulting in a sense of desperation and hopelessness. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 With the passage of time, the issues have intensified rather than become resolved. To date there remains numerous unanswered questions, and
 the advent of new inventions has served only increase the number of these unanswered questions. AIDS still remains a mystery for mankind. 
\par One of the most important facts known about the HIV virus is that it enters only some and not all the cells of human
 beings. Its main target is the helper T cells, which are the most effective elements of the defence system. This is a very important point. Among numerous types of cells, the virus chooses those cells of the defence system which are, in effect, the most 
beneficial for it and this instigates the destruction of the human body. 
\par When T cells, the vital elements of the defence system, are seized, the defence system is deprived of its brain team, and is no longer able to recognize the enemy. This could be regar
ded as an ingenious war tactic. An army without any effective communication and intelligence systems would be considered to have lost its main strength. 
\par Furthermore, the antibodies produced by the human body do not harm the AIDS virus. AIDS patients continue to produce antibodies, however, they are not as effective in the absence of the killer T cells.
\par One unanswered questions is: How does the HIV virus know exactly what target to focus on? By the time the AIDS virus understands that the T cells are regard
ed as the "brains" of the defence system, it will be destroyed by the existing system immediately upon entering the human body. However, it is impossible for the AIDS virus to conduct any form of intelligence surveillance prior to entering the human body.
 How then has the AIDS virus developed this strategy? 
\par This is only the first of many amazing skills mastered by the AIDS virus. 
\par At the second stage, the virus has to attach itself to the cells which it has set as a target for itself. This procedure is not at all difficult for the AIDS virus. In fact, it attaches to these cells as a key fits into its lock. 
\par At the third stage, the HIV virus undergoes a series of miraculous processes, which will ensure its longevity. 
\par The HIV virus is a retrovirus. This mean
s that its genetic make-up contains solely RNA and no DNA. But a retrovirus needs DNA to remain alive. To provide this, it has recourse to a very interesting method: it uses the nucleic acids of its host cell and converts its RNA into DNA by means of an e
n
zyme called "the reverse transcriptase", meaning it will reverse the process. Then it places this DNA in the DNA found in the nucleus of its host cell. The inheritance material of the virus has now become the inheritance material of the T cell. As the cel
l multiplies, so does the HIV virus. The cell starts to work as a factory for the virus. But invading a single cell does not satisfy the HIV virus. It will eventually attempt to seize the whole body.
\par Then the fourth stage comes. The initial HIV virus and others want to leave their host cells and invade other cells to facilitate their extraordinary proliferation. They do not expend much effort in doing so. Everything takes place at a natural pace. The 
m
embrane of the invaded T cells cannot tolerate the pressure of the multiplication process, and is riddled with holes, allowing the HIV viruses to get out of the cell to seek alternative hosts. As the HIV virus increases in number, it also kills its host T
 cell. 
\par The successful HIV virus has now completely seized the human body. Unless mankind succeeds in discovering an effective cure to beat this virus, it will remain there. It is entirely at the discretion of the HIV virus either to lie dormant for many ye
ars, or instigate an immediate attack on the human body.

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 After entering the human body, the HIV virus can produce up to ten billion viruses a day. The excessive number of viruses produced in one day is unmanageable, 
despite the technological advancements of the day. The HIV virus cannot be considered as a simple structure. What we have here is a micro-organism, so advanced and intelligent that it can duplicate millions of its own copies, possesses a plan to capture i
ts host cell, and is able to cause the death of a huge human body.
\par In addition to the abilities of the HIV virus mentioned above, the HIV virus is also able to assume varying forms in an attempt to prevent its capture by the defence system. This makes the H
IV virus immune to the effects of medications aimed at treating it today. Modern medicine has attacked the virus with a variety of medications at the same time and barely succeeded in dealing with the resistance of the virus. Although the virus is partial
ly eradicated, the only positive outcome has been the prolonging of the patients\rquote  lives to a limited extent. 
\par It is of great interest how a virus like the HIV virus can regenerate itself when faced with the danger of being eradicated. Scientists are left helpless in the presence of such skillful tactics. 
\par These are not the only mind-boggling tactics used by the HIV virus. helper T cells circulating in the bloodstream swim along, interlocking with one another like the metallic projections of a zipper. The HIV
 leaps from one T cell to another to avoid contact with the antibodies in the blood stream. All this is done by a virus, which is only one micron in size, possesses no DNA and cannot even be qualified as a living creature. The extraordinary ability of the
 
HIV virus to recognize the human body so well, develop advanced systems to overcome the human body, implement the necessary strategies without any errors and constantly modify itself to be protected from all kinds of weapons used by the body are all truly
 amazing. This is a very good example of how helpless mankind is rendered in the presence of a minute virus, which cannot be seen with the naked eye.

e system possesses an "irreducible complexity". This term refers to an intact system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively ce
ase functioning. As an example, let us think of the devices we would need if we were to send a fax: 
\par - A facsimile device
\par - A telephone line
\par - A cable 
\par - Paper. 
\par If any one of these items is absent you cannot send a fax. Nothing from the above list must be 
missing. Besides, they must conform to exact specifications. For example, the length of the cable must be sufficient for the plug to reach the socket, otherwise the available items will be of no use. Similarly, although all elements of the defence system 
f
ulfill their functions perfectly, if there are a few components which malfunction, this would cause the body to lose the war. For example, if the tiny granules located within the T cells do not function properly, they cannot store toxins, which in turn ca
n
not be transferred to the enemy, again resulting in the war being lost. Therefore, in a system where the enemy cannot finally be killed, important functions such as the formation of warrior cells, their training, the transmission of the necessary signals 
t
o appropriate locations by the cells at the right time, and the thousands of combinations needed by our genes to produce antibodies, or the storing of limitless information in the memory cells, would all be worthless. The system would simply not work. Sim
i
larly, the existence of the many and varied functions of the human body, which has an irreducible complexity, is equally useless in the absence of a defence system. If the defence system did not exist or failed to operate properly, no human being would be
 able to survive. 
\par How then do evolutionists explain the formation of such a vital and complex system? Actually, they have no answers which can shed light on the subject. Their only assertion is based on the view that the defence system has developed throug
h gradual evolutionary processes. They hold that the mechanisms that provide this gradual development are "natural selection" and "mutations".
\par But it is impossible for slight, successive coincidental modifications to produce such a complex system as the th
eory of evolution suggests. As emphasized before, the immune system would simply not function unless it existed with all its elements intact. To reiterate, a malfunctioning defence system would cause the human being to die within a short time. 
\par The second 
point of the argument is the process of "Natural Selection". As we will explain in more detail in the chapter, "The Evolution Deceit", the process of "Natural Selection" refers to the transfer of advantageous qualities to subsequent generations. 
\par There is 
a consensus among scientists that the concept of such a mechanism is far from being satisfactory in explaining complex systems. The renowned American specialist in biochemistry, Michael J. Behe, made the following statements with relation to natural selec
tion in his book, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 "Darwin\rquote s Black Box"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 :

An irreducibly complex biological system, if there is such a thing, would be a powerful challenge to Darwinian evolution. Since natural selection can only choose systems that are already working, then if a biological 
system cannot be produced gradually it would have to arise as an integrated unit, at one fell swoop, for natural selection to have anything to react on. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai0\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i0\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7827491 12}{\rtlch\fcs1

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 In this book, we explained the not so well known aspects of the army inside you, that is, your defence system.
 We have deliberately directed attention away from the complicated details of the extraordinary jobs the defence cells do to "how" the system operates. We searched for the answer to the question: "How can such minute cells which can be viewed only under a
n electron microscope produce such a complicated system as the defence system?" We delved further and examined how these cells, which make up the immune system were initially formed. 
\par All cells of the immune system are initially normal cells, which go throu
gh different educative stages ending with a "Sufficiency Exam". Only those cells that are able to recognize enemy cells and do not conflict with other normal bodily cells are allowed to live. How and when was the first cell developed and who held the firs
t "sufficiency exam"? Who has taught the cell what to do?
\par It is clearly unexpected that cells and associated organs can converse freely with each other, work in total agreement, make plans, and implement these plans efficiently. Do not forget that the topic
 of discussion here is numerous bodily organs and one trillion cells. It is impossible to imagine that one trillion people could be organized in such a perfect way and fulfill their duties without anything being skipped, forgotten, or confused, or any kin
d of chaos being caused in the mounting of such a defence, which is a supremely difficult task. 
\par There is a definite reality, which must be accepted, and that is: cells, as well as everything in the universe without exception, from the smallest to the biggest, have been specially created by Allah Who possesses endless power, knowledge and wisdom.

d have been formed through minute coincidences over a period of millions of years.
\par Any person who suggests that everything has been formed through coincidences and refuses to accept that a "Creator" has created the entire universe, despite his awareness of 
the functioning of one or more than one miraculous system among numerous others continuously at work in his body, is also unaware that he has been mentioned in a clearly defined character type in the Qur\rquote

from a single antibody.
\par Those scientists who have become aware of the situation they are in have started to distance themselves from evolutionary associations, realizing the shameful nature of such explanations. 
\par Another group of scientists accept the theory of evolution, not because it is accurate and they believe in it, but because there is no other theory to support their denial of Allah\rquote s existence. 
\par However, there is no obligation to accept and follow a certain theory. When people become curious about the creation of the universe and its contents, it will be sufficient for them to assess the self-evident truths objectively and with a free mind.

\par As we have continuously stressed in this book, there is not a shred of evidence based on any trials, experiment
s or observations that could support the claims of the theory of evolution. Scientific disciplines such as biology, biochemistry, microbiology, genetics, palaeontology and anatomy have made it clear that the theory of evolution is an imaginary hypothesis 
about events which have never taken place and nor can ever take place. (See the chapter on "The Evolution Deceit").
\par Today, all research carried out in various branches of science, shows that all living and non-living beings on the earth and in the sky have 
been created by an all-powerful and almighty Creator Who possesses eternal wisdom, knowledge and might. To see this fact, and to understand the fictitious nature of fabricated theories, such as that of evolution, advanced technology or scientific knowledg

Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences,

\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 It is 
Allah Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail. Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by Allah, but are products of coincidences, to be true.
\par Unsurprisingly, 
when we look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances which atoms res
t upon, and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with them.
\par This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century.

published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. 
\par Darwin\rquote s theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution.

 generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the alle
ged evolutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within
 the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology.

, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experime
nts were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However
, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par Even in the period when Darwin wrote }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 , the belief that bacter
ia could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after Darwin\rquote s book was published, the discovery of Louis Pasteur disproved this belief, which constituted the groundwork of evolution. Pasteur summarized the conclusion he reached after time-consuming studies and experiments: }
{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid7827491 "The claim that inanimate matter can originate life is buried in history for good." }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7827491 20}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22

ped laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing inorganic materials together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par The DNA molecule, whi
ch is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopaedias 
of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both 
depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fa

ge. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to b
e formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation.

\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby nu
merous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to de
velop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them.

men of today evolved from some kind of ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, it is claimed that there existed some "transitional forms" between modern man and his ancestors.
