Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deologies as fascism and communism.

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (May God bless him and grant him peace), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfectio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to exp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, Frenc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uch ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serv\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, rend\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reas\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
on for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effor\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, God's Existence
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the last 140 years it h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explaine\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the ot\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
her books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great servi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ce to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 encouraging them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in the heart.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A family who returns from a long holiday only to find that their home has been furnished with new items in a most ordered and perfect manner and that every detail has been thought of and provided to meet their needs, wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ll be most astonished and affected. They will wonder who arranged this surprise, for how could they not in the face of such an extraordinary event? Would they really say: \'93\loch\f0 We don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
\hich\f0 t really care how this happened, just as long as it happened\'94\loch\f0 ? Or would they\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
suppose that everything happened by itself or by chance, and that the new furniture decided on its own to install itself there? Such ideas are laughable, for all events are the result of a certain intelligence, consciousness, and power that makes them hap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 en. For that reason, the existence of someone who has thought of everything and consciously arranged it is clear.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This example also applies to the universe, our world, and all of its living and non-living entities. There are countless infinitely complex sy\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
stems and delicate balances in the universe, in all of existence and all phenomena, from the human body to the sky, from animals to the depths of the oceans. Everyone who can think and reason sees that only God, with His superior power and intelligence, c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uld have created these complex systems and delicate balances. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These people encounter countless proofs of God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s existence, such as brightly colored, sweet-smelling flowers; delicious fruits and vegetables that spring from muddy soil; the sense organs, whic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h enable us to enjoy each created item\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s unique properties (e.g., smell and taste); the human body with its many complex systems, all of which work in harmony; the Sun, which illuminates and warms, and its ideal size and distance from our Earth; the rain,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 which brings bone-dry soil to life; and countless other proofs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Each of these is a \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 sign leading to faith.\'94\loch\f0 
 In other words, they are miracles of creation and truths that guide people to faith and then increase that faith. Every unbiased person who thinks d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eeply about these proofs will come to faith by clearly seeing these reflections of God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s existence and greatness. Thanks to these signs, believers will come to know God better and increase their faith in, love for, and fear [and awareness] of Him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 due to the pervasive materialist worldview to which they are subjected from childhood onward, most people cannot see these signs or else find it hard to see them. This misguided materialistic system, which suggests that everything depends on chance, coin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
idence, and natural phenomena, prevents people from seeing the evident miracles of creation that pervade the universe. It literally draws a curtain over their eyes. Most people do not look at these signs and say, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
How beautifully God has created these\'94\loch\f0 ; r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ther, they say, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 How nice.\'94\loch\f0  In other words, they look at them with a disinterested eye.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This book seeks to lift this curtain of indifference by dealing with the importance of these signs leading to faith. At the same time, it contains the views of several \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Islamic scholars of these signs and gives examples of them. Moreover, it also considers how these signs are the most effective way of disproving the superstitious teachings of the theory of evolution, the greatest deception of our time, and one that conti
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ues to lead people to atheism in the End Times.

Signs leading to faith are one of the most important means that lead people to belief. Those without faith live in deep heedlessness and cannot see any of the surrounding proofs of creation. As t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
heir societies have moved away from religion, their minds have drowned in the details of day-to-day life, and their perceptions and consciousness have become so weak that they cannot recognize these countless proofs. But as long as such people are sincere
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 and unbiased, there is hope that when they are told of the signs leading to faith, they will believe in God\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s existence and oneness, that He created all that exists from nothing, and perceive His infinite knowledge and might. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Since this world is a place of testing, it would be a mistake to expect to witness such a great miracle that would force everyone to choose faith whether they wanted to or not. For example, if a seed thrown onto the ground sprouted into a giant tree in a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
atter of seconds, the people who witnessed it would describe it as a great miracle. However, since billions of trees do the same thing, but only very gradually, this does not create the impression of a miracle at first sight. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s consider another exampl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e. Imagine that the human body, which ages as one grows older, suddenly aged before one\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

who witnessed it to think. And yet this actually happens\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
the only difference is the time span. The fact that such miraculous phenomena actually take place so slowly that we almost do not recognize them may appear to be something very ordinary to people wh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 these proofs. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The greatest untruth asserted by those who deny God is that everything, living or otherwise, came about as the result of chance. In order to invalidate this superstitious belief and bring the proofs of creation into the light of day, we need
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to study and explain these signs according to the tenets and practices of modern science. Unbiased people who come to see the magnificent structures in living things, as well as the extraordinary systems and countless delicate balances in the universe, r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 alize that these cannot have come about by chance and that God created everything through His infinite might. Thus, the unbelievers\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 claim that all of creation is the result of chance are swept aside. As the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an tells us: }{\b\f0\insrsid9534591\charrsid10752306 \loch\af0\dbch\af13\hich\f0 \'93\loch\f0 Say: \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 Truth has come and false

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who are unaware of the signs leading to faith are defenseless in the face of atheism\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s assertions. For example, all of us have seen people who were raised in conservative famil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ies and received a religious upbringing rapidly lose their faith during their high school or university years because of what they hear and see around them. The reason for this is that atheists adorn their superstitious beliefs with \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
reason and science\'94\loch\f0  i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 order to portray themselves as people who know everything about nature and the universe, who have grasped the laws of life and unearthed all of the relevant facts. In this way, they influence and mislead those people with conservative upbringings but who
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 are unaware of the signs leading to faith, for their faith is not built on sure and certain knowledge. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, someone who knows about these signs can easily identify and deal with the atheists\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  lies and falsehoods. Such people are more useful both to th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emselves and to those around them. Being unaware of these signs leaves a person defenseless when confronted by atheists, whereas knowing, comprehending, and explaining these signs makes them intellectually superior to all forms of atheism.

 One can better understand why evolution\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ists are so keen to avoid discussing the eye after examining its structure. The eye possesses a very complex structure made up of a large number of organelles and components. Its functions are amazingly detailed and complex. The eye emerges as a result of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the different organelles and components that comprise it and that work in harmony. Despite this, evolutionists maintain that all existing organs came into being by themselves over time. The eye
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s requirement that all of its different organelles be present\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fully formed and working perfectly means that no such chance-based process could have taken place. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An eye that cannot secrete tears will soon dry up and go blind. Furthermore, a tear\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s antiseptic properties protect the eye against germs. Evolutionists are\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 unwilling to consider how the eye, which would dry up in a matter of hours in the absence of tears, managed to wait for millions of years until the tear glands emerged. In order for the eye to fulfill its function, it needs a body that has all of its sys

ems and organs in place, as well as such tissues and organelles as the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, choroid, eye muscles, and eyelid. In addition, in the absence of the superb network of nerves that connects the eye and the brain, and without the ex
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eedingly complex visual center in the brain, we would be unable to see. Moreover, all of these parts have such special and complex structures that they could never have come into being by chance. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consider the following facts: If any organelle, such as the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 lens, were absent, or if the positions of the lens and the pupil were changed, the eye would be unable to fulfill its function of sight. In short, the eye\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s structure is the work of very special planning. There is only one valid and logical explanation o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 how these organelles and strata, not one of which could have come about unaided and by chance, adhere to such a specific plan, work in such harmony, and exist in the same place: God, Lord of infinite intelligence and might, creates all of these organelle

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption tha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, maggots developing in rottin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\insrsid9534591\charrsid10752306 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Or\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 igin of Species}{\f0\insrsid9534591\charrsid10752306 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple exp

For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this que\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
stion from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their neck
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid9534591\charrsid10752306 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid9534591\charrsid10752306 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

heritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-1884) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutation\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only ha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is present

lt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eally claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
et them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions

as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oduce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
matoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
annot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that micros
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with God's superior creation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of evolutionist\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "cente
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
en such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and ext
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
emely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 D\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 levision, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ts atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ansmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest so
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the hig
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
est-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds tha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ruth lies beyond all this.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
evolution is incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate fo

ms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
