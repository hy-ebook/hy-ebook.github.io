Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His penname is a composite of the names }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Aaron) and }{

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpos
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godles
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ide
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 logies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eans in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
adily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
or the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late.

A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and therefore, Allah's Existence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject.

The Qur'an defines patience as one of the paths that lead people from darkness to light and as an attribute of morality that is superior to, wide-ranging, and very different from the daily behavior of many people. True patience is a moral c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
haracteristic displayed in the face of difficulty and in every moment of life. Moreover, it requires the demonstration of determination and consistency during times of ease and hardship, and is a lifelong endeavour that never goes astray, even for a momen

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Allah gives the most striking examples of patience in the lives of the Prophets, because they showed patience while teaching Allah's religion and leading a moral life. They never deviated from their devotion to Allah, and were patient people who sought o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nly Allah's approval.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This book will define this high moral virtue taught by the Qur'an and invite people to acquire true patience. Inaccurate understandings of patience will be explained along with the kind of patience Allah requires, how Allah may test p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eople so that they can acquire a more perfect patience, and the great return Allah promises to those who exhibit great patience.

rcy for the faithful.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 People can gain Allah's approval and love by fully applying the Qur'an's truths in their lives. Allah requires the faithful to adhere to the Qur'an's morality as long as they are alive, without showing any weakness. To
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 carry out this task successfully, the faithful must acquire the supreme characteristic of patience, which is the result of faith. Those who learn the secret of patience can demonstrate the required steadfastness in every act and prayer. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Attaining this se\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cret is extremely easy. Allah manifests His attribute "Al-Sabur" (The Patient) on those who believe in Him and helps perfect the determination in their hearts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The real source of this lifelong true patience is the believers' faith in Allah. They know that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge, that everything occurs only with His permission, and that He hides thousands of blessings and benefits behind all events. In addition, they do not forget that Allah is the Friend, Guardian, and Helper of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aithful. Thus, although it may not seem so at first glance, all events are arranged to somehow benefit the believers. For this reason, patience is not a moral characteristic that makes life difficult for the faithful; rather, it is a form of worship that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hey accept wholeheartedly and with joy. Here is one point of difference between true patience and the view of patience as commonly understood in society.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Many people do not know the true meaning of patience, how truly patient people are required to behave\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, or how important this is in Allah's sight. They regard patience more as holding up one's head when faced with difficulties and problems, either overcoming or enduring them. Thus, they consider patience as the ability to withstand something, up to a cert
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in point, and that an occasional loss of patience is quite normal. Moreover, according to this non-Qur'anic understanding, it is utterly futile to show patience in a matter from which no concrete benefit can be derived. And so when faced with such a situa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion, they give way to frustration and believe that being patient is useless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Qur'anic concept of true patience is quite different from this understanding of endurance. In the first place, people experience patience as the instruction of Allah and so ca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n neither exhaust nor lose it. They carry out this form of worship joyfully and fervently and expect no concrete benefit in exchange for it, because they are patient solely to earn Allah's approval. What matters for them is the knowledge that they will ea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n His approval with their superior morality. For them, such a reward is enough.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, the patience recommended by the Qur'an is not a moral characteristic employed only in times of hardship. True patience is shown in fully applying all of the Qur'an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
's teachings, in being scrupulous in guarding against all behavior that Allah warns against, and in being determined to live according to the Qur'an's morality as long as one is alive and with no thought of deviating from it, regardless of circumstances.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One reason why the believers can show patience is because their\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 faith enables them to appreciate Allah's might and glory. Those who know that Allah has boundless wisdom and boundless knowledge also know that only He can determine what will be the finest life for them. They know that Allah possesses all knowledge abou

 all creatures and events in the past, present, and future, whereas people have only a limited intelligence that is prone to making mistakes in determining what is good and what is bad. In most cases, a seemingly unfavorable event may bring many benefits,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 although people may well be totally unaware of this. Allah points out this important truth: }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No matter what the circumstances, the faithful do not complain or whine. In addition, Alla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h points out that His creation of difficulty together with ease is His immutable law: }{

cumstances. They will exhibit good behavior when they can meet all of their physical and spiritual needs easily and ensure their own comfort, but will change completely when faced with any problem that may endanger their comfort. They cannot meet even a t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 mporary affliction with patience. This becomes very clear in the case of illness. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How people behave during times of illness, hunger, exhaustion, and similar events are clear indications as to whether they do\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or do not\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 possess sound morality. Given this fa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ct, difficult times are very valuable opportunities for people to prove their faith in, devotion to, and trust in our Lord. Allah states that among the conditions for true morality and true goodness is showing correct behavior by being patient in times of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 trouble and sickness (Surat al-Baqara, 177).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When faced with such a problem as illness, what enables the faithful to behave steadfastly and with patience is their deep attachment to and faith in Allah. Prophet Ibrahim (as) expressed this truth by saying }{
\b\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd when I am ill, He heals me"}{\f0\fs22\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat ash-Shu'ara': 80).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Like Prophet Ibrahim (as), believers also know that Allah creates both the illness and the cure, and so they are not seized with despair when they fall ill. On the contrary, they are grateful to our \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Lord for those years in which He allowed them to live in health. Understanding that a healthy life is only one of Allah's many gifts to them, they continue to behave gratefully even when they are ill.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 They also continue to be extremely grateful and steadfa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
st in cases of accident and injury. They hope that after they enter Paradise, Allah will re-create them in such a fine form that it cannot be compared with their worldly bodies. This is their hoped-for reward for their steadfast patience when confronted w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 th various difficulties. For this reason they do not forget that whatever they have suffered here will entitle them to a great recompense in the afterlife.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who are precluded from having faith, due to their attachment to the world, cannot show patienc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e in the face of such events and so sink into great hopelessness and grief. For example, those with crippled limbs say that they would rather die than live with such a body; some even try to commit suicide. Believing that this life is the only one that th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y have, they think that living with certain defects and deficiencies makes life meaningless. Even if they do not try to commit suicide, they develop a very unpleasant personality and try to create problems for those around them. Whether they accept their 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ituation or not, there is no way that they can avert such an event. If they put their trust in Allah, however, they may hope that He will allow them to be reborn in Paradise with a brand new body that is flawless, imperishable, and cannot be damaged. But 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f they do not trust in Allah, their present life and their future life in the Hereafter will be destroyed, for their ignorance will cause them to rebel against Allah and be "rewarded" with Hell.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The behavior of those who live the Qur'an's morality is compl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
etely different. When they are injured, lose an organ, or experience a similar disaster, their behavior does not change. Knowing that they are being tested and that the end result will be positive, they remain patient and do their best to earn Allah's app
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oval. Even if they can no longer make any physical effort to realize this goal, they try to develop ideas that can benefit people and remind them of the Hereafter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who turn away from Allah when they become ill or when they are injured are not aware o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f their great error, for only Allah can heal them or rescue them from their illness. Doctors, medicines, and treatments can be provided only with Allah's permission. Understanding this, the faithful face their illness with patience and patiently ask Him f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r a cure. They also make the best possible use of doctors, medicines, and treatments, and always remember that these will be of benefit only if Allah wills it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Qur'an gives the example of Prophet Ayyub (as), who always sought refuge in Allah when faced\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  with illness. Allah praises his morality, as follows: }{

 accident, becomes bedridden, and requires intensive treatment and care. In such a situation, the other spouse will care for him or her for a while, perhaps to avoid the neighbors' criticism if they do not do so or for some other reason, but again only fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a limited time. After this time, the spouse may abandon the other because he or she has no patience when it comes to self-sacrifice for others.

 a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ost developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of protein\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molecule,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they b

\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9708026\charrsid739240 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rld in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp im
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ge for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and desi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ns have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct v
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sion like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
our room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mage than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auri
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
le and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ;\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing soun
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0
