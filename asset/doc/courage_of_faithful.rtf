A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the la\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
st 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah'\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, luc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d narrative, they can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read ind\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ividually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the public\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ation and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h

as published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aas), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 jections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet (saas), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: To convey the Qur' an's\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rom India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turki

Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
asy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, def
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ose who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thor's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
revalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which peo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 been unjustly attacked, or the child who can find not even a crumb to eat. He is of the corrupt mentality that suggests, "Let the snake which does not bite me live a thousand years." He thinks only of himself.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such persons are quite common, however. There \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
are many who think that if they can avoid thinking of these concerns, they themselves can be at peace. Though he finds himself in a cruel world, this does not trouble him or affect his conscience.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, during such times, there are great responsibilitie\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fact, in every period of history, there have been those who fulfilled this duty. They came out fearlessly, trying to promote good in the world and keep it alive. The basic characteristics to be found among them were a fear of Allah, listening to their con
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cience, courage, outspokenness, and a willingness to accept responsibility.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to replace the cruelty and injustice which have become pervasive throughout the world with good, prosperity and justice, the first strategy is to step courageously along t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In ord\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering this subject will help us to recognize that throughout the centuries, every movement for the promotion of good has been opposed by some other people.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Of course, in every period of history, as well as those who struggled for virtue, beauty,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 morality, peace and tranquility to prevail, there have been a large numbers of those who killed others unjustly, expelled them from their homes, worked to spread moral degeneracy, oppressed the weak, all the while seeking by these means also to exalt the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 selves.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In the same way that the aim of Muslims is to spread moral excellence, the aim of these others is to spread their evil throughout the world. This is demonstrated by events throughout history. Attempts have been made in every perio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d to place under pressure the prophets and the faithful who followed them in preaching superior morality and to stop them with ugly and baseless slanders and various methods of oppression.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, there is a special secret that those who oppose good to be\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 come established in the world can neither know, or even understand. As is pointed out in the verse, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0

 for the courageous acts of unbelievers, these are carried out solely for their own gain or other worldly ambitions. Therefore, those who are removed from the light of the Qur'an apply what they deem as courage to the wrong situations. In matters where tr

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid11302179 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can explain this matter further with examples from our own lives. A person meets a poor man in the street who needs help. He wants to help, but those
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  around him try to dissuade him. "Leave him be," they say, and, "Is it your job to help him?" mockingly to prevent him from doing so. In such a situation, the person is faced with a choice.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some, fearing that their friends will look down on them, or that t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hey may lose them, reject the right moral way and leave the needy person to his own devices. But, a Muslim helps the person without fearing any blame, because he knows that the needy person has been created by Allah, and put before him for a purpose. This
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
may be a test of whether or not he will demonstrate steadfastness in being moral. A believer with insight knows right away that Allah has especially ordained this moment, and chooses the kind of behavior complying with Allah's good pleasure. If his friend
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  mock him, it does not put him off at all. He behaves courageously in doing what he knows to be right.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 From time to time, a person determined to act morally may encounter others who oppose him and who try to make him abandon his morals. When we study the v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erses of the Qur'an, we are led to understand such a situation as a test. As explained in the Qur'an, good people will always come across wicked people, who want to impart their wicked ways to others. Therefore, they try to interfere with those who do goo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . Allah tells us this truth in several verses:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Everybody has moments of courage but the matters concerning which pe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ople are brave, the purposes for which they achieve courage and the limits of the courage they demonstrate may be very different from those described in the Qur'an.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a definition of courage is required, the definition of one who does not know the moralit\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y of the Qur'an, and the kind of courage Allah recommends, will certainly be different from the definition of a Muslim. While a Muslim determines what is courage according to the Qur'an, a great many will describe some hero-figure constructed from their i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
agination through the influence of the action films. For instance, they would describe driving in the wrong direction on an expressway heavy with traffic, something often seen in films, as an example of great courage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The concept of courage for high school\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 students is very different. A student who argues with the teacher may be regarded by his friends as very brave. Likewise, one who behaves rebelliously and breaks the rules is thought of as brave. For example, in a school that requires navy blue pants, a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 erson who shows up with green pants has great courage, according to the other students. Cheating on exams is also an example of courage in a society ignorant of the morality of the Qur'an. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For a businessman, in a society plagued with ignorance, courage me\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ans being able to take certain financial risks. For example, putting a large sum of money into the stock market is an example of courage for such people. Or, we can say that investing in a brand-new start up is for only the bravest people.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, in soc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ieties not adhering to religious morality, each will interpret courage according to his own experience or the environment he comes from. Because the criteria for them is not the Qur'an, but their own principles and habits, what each individual understands
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
as courage differs. For example, for those living in slums, courage is understood in a way specific to their circumstances, while the definition of courage offered by the upper-classes will differ accordingly. What a housewife understands by courage is di
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ferent from a politician's idea of it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is possible to multiply examples of this type relative to the number of different classes of society. But, the common point among them all is their perception that courage resides in a variety of extreme acts outsi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 de the norm, that is, is perceived as going beyond the limits otherwise set by society.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In a society whose culture does not hold the Qur'an supreme, this deviated notion knows no limits. A thief may regard himself as courageous, and claim that his business\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is one which requires a great deal of audacity. Each evaluates situations differently. Because everybody is sure that his opinion is correct, conflicts inevitably arise between those who admire their own opinions and their own value judgments.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On the othe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r hand, when people act according to the Qur'an, they are adhering to the noblest and most correct model of morality. True courage, according to the Qur'an, bears no relationship whatsoever to the notions listed above. According to the Qur'an, courage is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 soundness of character, which springs from trusting in and relying on Allah, and devoting one's life to Him at all times. As we will explain in later chapters, the best examples of this soundness of character can be seen in the lives of our prophets (saa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ) sent by Allah.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What we learn from their examples mentioned in the Qur'an is that courage must be rational. Allah calls on us to use our intelligence, and in a verse refers to those who do not as such:

 which can be discerned at all times in the behavior of the faithful, will make itself known in their acts of bravery. The courage shown by the faithful is not blind or emotional. They may at times place themselves at risk, but never on an impulse. As in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ll behavior of the faithful, wisdom is its source. The faithful do not engage in acts of courage blindly or recklessly.

earlessly in such immorality, not hesitating to trample on others for the sake of their own gain, and recognizing no authority whatsoever as a mark of their superiority over others. In fact, fomenting conflict, oppressing others, trampling on other people
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s rights, and other acts of a similar nature, all represent wicked behavior which is forbidden by Allah in the verses of the Qur'an, and for which they will be unable to answer for in the Hereafter. Courage only has real meaning when it is combined with s

In truth, this courage shown by the faithful is merely that which Allah has ordered. For that reason, the faithful perform their greatest feats of bravery with composure. Because, when it is a matter of earning the goodwill of Allah, there is nothing that
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he is not willing to give up.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is Allah Who gives life and property. Just as He confers these on whom He wishes, so, too, it is in Allah's power to take them back, whenever and however He likes. It should also not be forgotten that nothing happens by coi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ncidence. When living according to the morality of the Qur'an, one who acts with courage and determination for the sake of Allah, will experience nothing that is not written for him according to his fate. Nevertheless, these circumstances are but of the g
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eatest good for him in this world and the Afterlife. That is, when a person behaves courageously through difficulty, when he tries to overcome that problem, no matter what he may come up against, the outcome will be beneficial for him. Because, in the Qur
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 an, Allah informs us that He will surely conclude the affairs of His faithful believers to their advantage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 From the Qur'an, which provides us with the best definition of true courage, we may recognize from the examples provided of the lives of the prophet\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, and the faithful who followed them, that courage exhibited for the approval of Allah is an exalted virtue.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As discussed to this point, the most important element which distinguishes the type of courage outlined in the Qur'an from the mistaken notions of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 society is purpose. When we examine the Qur'an, we can see that, according to it, true courage comprises of very different purposes from those commonly recognized. The aim of courage, according to the Qur'an, is neither to gain the praise and admiration 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f others, nor to satisfy one's own ego. The aim is solely to earn Allah's good pleasure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Of course, this is the reason for the substantial differences between the courage of the Qur'an and society's conception of it. As explained earlier, according to the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
notion of courage prevalent in society, there are worldly aims; that is, when demonstrating courage in any matter, the person does not have in mind a purpose of achieving the Hereafter, but striving for worldly goals. Maybe he is doing something noble and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
good, like, for example, rescuing a child who has run onto the road from being run over, but the aim here is to ease his own conscience. Or, perhaps, he is defending the rights of someone who has suffered injustice. His behavior is good, but his aim is to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 win the praise of those around him. Really, he should perform these actions to earn Allah's good pleasure, because in the sight of Allah that is what matters.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Muslims, never losing sight of this truth, do not show courage for the sake of worldly advantages\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 or benefits. They never harbor desires such as wanting to be praised for their courage, or to be called brave, or to attract other people's attention. It is enough for them that Allah knows about the courage they have demonstrated for His sake.

 aspects of patience. For the most part, they believe it to be a difficult, troublesome and oppressive duty. Their understanding of the meaning of patience is mentioned as forbearance, a period of undesired waiting for something. However, patience means d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
termined and persistent commitment to a task of which Allah approves, not abandoning it, or becoming wearied, but carrying resolutely it to a conclusion. For example, the ability to remain tolerant despite adverse circumstances, to restrain anger and resp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd with kindness, in circumstances where rage might otherwise be vented, and to be determined to do so, at whatever cost, and not to feel overburdened, is a true example of patience.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, patience means waiting contently in expectance of the positive\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 outcome promised by Allah. This is not, as Satan tries to portray it, something difficult or burdensome. On the contrary, it increases the motivation of the faithful. For example, all believers long for the Afterlife. They passionately desire to be unite
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in Paradise, waiting patiently for this end. A believer who is patient for the good pleasure of Allah, in any matter, enjoys the contentment and peace of mind of knowing that he will surely receive from Allah his due reward.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When a believer is treated bad\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ly, he deals with it patiently. That is, he does not become angry or despair, but maintains the composed behavior commanded in the Qur'an.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another idea which, like patience, Satan tries to distort, is the subject of this book: Courage. If people do not con\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Throughout history, one of the most salient characteristics of the faithful who opposed unbelievers was their acceptance of the great responsibility of propagating religious morality, a task which they fulfilled courageously. That the faithfu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l persist in conveying good morals, even when threatened, astonishes the unbelievers. What encouraged both the prophets and those who followed them to remain steadfast and be courageous was their faith in Allah. They were certain of the fact that Allah wa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  watching over them, of the truth of the Hereafter, and that they would be called to account for their actions in this world.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To fully appreciate the courage of the faithful, it is first necessary to understand its source: The morality taught in the Qur'an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. A person must fear Allah, understand His verses, and the importance of the behavior He encourages. Clearly, one who sits idly by, watching the tyrannical alliance of the wicked, fails to carry out the duty expected of him. However, if we consider that t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e great majority of the Earth's inhabitants do not follow the path of Allah, then clearly such effort requires great courage. Because, the slightest disruption of the comfort the wicked enjoy riles them into action. They may become oppressive, conspire, s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ander or resort even to physical violence. It is then that the difference between those who show true courage and those who do not, can be determined.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Most just close their eyes to the immorality of their friends and relatives, so as not to be rejected or \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
harassed by them. They do not fulfill their duty of warning them otherwise. In societies where the morality of the Qur'an is not adhered to, most may stand idly by, and ignore the prevailing injustices, even though it bothers their conscience. In their he
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rts they may reject that cruelty, and may want to eradicate it, but they cannot find the courage to struggle against it. Without drive or determination there can be no courage. Where there is no drive and determination, one does not think of preventing th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 evils he encounters, nor finds solutions to do so. It must not be forgotten that simply being bothered by cruelty, while observing evil that abounds, and merely complaining about it, is not a sufficient way of dealing with it. Rather, it requires sincere
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 effort. But, to do so requires courage.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If the courageous do not take initiative, there will be great mayhem and oppression on Earth, and the world will become uninhabitable. Those who do not show such courage, who are hesitant to preach their religion, wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ll suffer great loss. As we are told in the verses of the Qur'an:

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous gene\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ration, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to pro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while.

understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molecule, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they bo

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism adde\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful.

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary

Besides all the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "exper

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phos\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
phorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eve to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horse

, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uld not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mpletely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of evolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11302179 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brai\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 serve a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ich you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world can
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research ha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional im
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ge, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
elevision system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to pro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ou that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
roducing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ailable sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the ou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ur brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
i you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the ey\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact: Who perceives these electro-chemical nerve impulses as images, sounds, odors, and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all

his without feeling any need for an eye, an ear, and a nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? Of course it does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer, and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everythi

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with

 such scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it is quite justifiable to speak of this theory as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hem as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of Prophet Ibrahim (as) worshippi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact, Allah has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur'an. In many verse, He reveals in many verses that some peoples' minds will be close\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0
