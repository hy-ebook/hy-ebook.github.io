\par A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash and therefore, Allah's existence\emdash 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is th
erefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par All the aut
hor's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's min
d
. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spiritua
lity are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's b
ooks are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the

Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
a
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par Harun Yahya's works, translated into 57 different languages, constitute a collection for a total of more than 45,000 pages with 30,000 illustrations.
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (Joh
n), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against their peoples' lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and Prophet Muhammad (saas), la
s
t of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet [saas]), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of irreligious ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the
 objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet (saas), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an'
s message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose irreligious systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countri
es, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, Spain to Brazil, Malaysia to Italy, France to Bulgaria and Russia. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Chinese
, Swahili, Hausa, Dhivehi (spoken in Mauritius), Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, Indonesian, Bengali, Danish and Swedish. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering f
aith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate 
a
theism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these boo
ks refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in remov
ing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those wh
o doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind:
 The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of cre
a
tion and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late.
 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 During the course of your life, you have met a great many people. As well as those you encounter every day in person\emdash your family, friends and your colleagues at school and work\emdash 
you see dozens of people from all over the world in the newspapers and magazines. And on your TV screen, you watch the behavior of hundreds more. 
\par Think for a moment about these individuals you recall in your memory. Try to call to mind facial expressions and conversations you have grown accustomed to since your childhood... the comments
 some have made about their lives, their concerns and worries and the ways they express them... the remarks that colleagues repeat daily, and what others say amongst themselves about their families and financial problems. 
\par Try to recall in your mind's eye the people you've seen in the street, waiting at a bus stop, trying to battle their way home through dense traffic, or being splashed with rainwater by passing cars.
\par Remember the images of actors in TV programs, those who act the part of happy people, seem
ingly enjoying themselves in front of the cameras and who claim to the press that they're friends but behind one another's backs, say unbelievably bad things. Think about their spiritual state and the state of those unable to protect themselves from jealo
usy, hatred, rivalry or other such emotions\emdash and who, while trying to entertain others because it is their job to do so, betray their own unhappiness in everything they do off-stage and off-camera.
\par Examine the lives of people who have attained the highest possible worldly rank, who have enough money to buy whatever they want whenever they choose, who live in the finest houses and own the latest model cars, who wear the most expensive clothes and who
\emdash because of their achievements\emdash  are most respected and listened to in their community. 
\par When you carefully consider all these people, you will come across a very important truth. Whatever their circumstances may be, there is one significant feature they have in common: }{\b\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
The great majority of people lead unhappy lives.
\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 The goods and property they own, the jobs they perform, and their loved ones are not enough to make these people happy in any real sense. These people's lives are ruled not by happiness, tranqui
lity, pleasure and joy, but by negative emotions like melancholy, pessimism and hopelessness. A great part of most people's time is spent in this mood. When compared to true happiness, those moments when they are capable of being happy are fleeting and ex
tremely shallow. 
\par Sometimes, too, they may be driven to deceive both themselves and those around them. Yet deep inside, they are experiencing a secret sorrow that prevents them from taking pleasure in all the good they see around them.
\par So why are these people unhappy? Why do they suffer such deep inward sorrow and lead lives that lack tranquility?
\par The reason why they suffer from sorrow and feel unhappy even in the best of circumstances is because they live at a distance from Allah. Allah grants people happin
ess only through faith, and only in this way it is possible to take full pleasure in the beautiful things of life. So long as no sincere faith in accordance with the Qur'an exists, it is impossible to achieve true happiness by any means whatsoever.
\par This bo
ok will highlight this important truth and call on people to live out true and sincere faith. It will explain that people really create with their own efforts the systems that prevent them from being happy and enjoying life's blessings, and which plunge t
h
em into sorrow. It will make it clear that the only way to be protected against secret unhappiness is to believe in Allah with a sincere heart. It will remind the readers that so long as people do not achieve this sincerity towards Allah, they cannot expe
rience real happiness by any means whatsoever\emdash and that the secret sorrows of this world may well turn to eternal torment in the Hereafter.
\par In a verse of the Qur'an, Allah tells us that those who find happiness and salvation are the faithful:

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Despite all their efforts, many cannot experience happiness in the true sense. To a

m
e to attain their spiritual desires. Even if their wishes and expectations do become reality, still the results are never as they hoped. They cannot taste lasting happiness in the true sense. Mainly, they try not to reveal on their faces this dissatisfact
ion which they feel inside. But no matter how much they mimic happiness, they are living with a secret sorrow within.
\par In fact, they have every opportunity to be happy. In one verse of the Qur'an, Allah tells us about the blessings He grants people:

There is a way of life that the great majority of people share. This way of life we call the "satanic system," prevails where there is no religious morality. This system is founded on an insinc
erity that is so deeply rooted in people's lives that even those who appear to be the most sincere, whose behavior which is assumed to be perfectly straightforward, may have fundamentally insincere motives. 
\par Even though people fail to attribute any names t
o this system, they are naggingly aware of the error of the system under which they live. At every opportunity, they complain of the hypocrisy of others, because they have not experienced true friendship or true love and have no one they can trust in the 
full sense. Still, they themselves do not hesitate to display the same flawed morality towards all those around them. 
\par In this system, everyone is damaged by his own actions. Even if such people try in every possible way, still they cannot find genuine internal joy, tranquility and happiness\emdash 
yet they accept this as "a fact of life." In other words, according to them, Earthly life is not a place where true happiness and peace can be found on any lasting basis.
\par The truth is that unhappiness is not in any way a fact of life. On the contrary, it is extremely easy for people to find the solution for the internal troubles into which they fall. A verse in the Qur'an says, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"... Only in the remembrance of Allah can the heart find peace" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat ar-Ra'd: 28).}{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234  }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Here, Alla
h tells people that they can achieve true happiness only by finding faith. Only if they understand the mercy and protectiveness that Allah holds for them and live out their worldly lives in religious morality can people enjoy every moment. Only then can t
hey praise the beauty of what they see around them as it should be appreciated and begin to experience happiness.
\par In the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "Anyone who acts rightly, male or female, being a believer, We will give them a good life and We will recompense them according to the best of what they did" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat an-Nahl: 97), Allah promises that He will allow the faithful who believe in Him to live the finest lives in this world and the Hereafter. Those who follow Allah experience the blessings He promises, both in this world and the next.
\par On this point, however, there is an important truth that people ignore. In order for people to experience the fine things of this life and enjoy the blessings of the world and the large number of beautiful things which Allah has created for the
m, then, faith in its true meaning must be lodged in their hearts. Otherwise, by paying the proverbial lip service to faith and by resembling the truly faithful only in certain limited ways, people cannot protect themselves from the unhappiness within. To
 
know true happiness, people must bind their hearts to Allah in complete submission and live every moment in conformity to the Qur'an. Failing to do this, they will continue to suffer internal sorrow during every stage of their lives. No matter how much th
ey want to be happy they cannot be. On the contrary, their lives will be ruled by such negative emotions as despair, pessimism and hopelessness.
\par As you can see, the road to happiness is an extremely simple one. With the Qur'an, the Divine Book that Allah ha
s bestowed upon mankind as a mercy, He has shown people the secret of happiness. People can live a beautiful life only if they behave in accordance with their creation and the nature Allah has determined for them. People who turn aside from this path whic
h Allah has shown them as a blessing, or who fail to follow the path as it should be followed, are creating a world of unhappiness for themselves by their own efforts. As Allah tells us in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"Allah does not wrong people in any way; rather it is people who wrong themselves" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surah Yunus: 44), these people are only tormenting themselves.
\par The unhappiness experienced by these people leads to the reality described by Allah in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "Leave them then until they meet their Day when they will be struck 
down by the Blast: the Day their ploys will not profit them at all and they will not be helped. And those who do wrong will have a punishment besides that, but most of them do not know it" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat at-Tur: 45-47). In the Hereafter, Allah gives people recompense for what they do on Earth, but He also warns people that a torment of which most are not even aware will begin in the life of this world.
\par Allah refers to the difficulties that people who turn away from the faith will experience in worldly life, and what they will receive in the Hereafter in this verse: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"... if anyone turns away from My reminder, his life will be a dark and narrow one, and on the Day of Resurrection We will gather him blind" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surah Ta Ha: 124).}{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234  }{
\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Allah has shown people the way to protect themselves from this trouble and, as we have noted before, it is possible to do so through genuine sincerity and a deep faith in Allah.

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 The verse in the Qur'an, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "They have different ranks with Allah. Allah sees what they do" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surah Al 'Imran: 163), draws our attention to an important truth. Some refuse to accept the faith. But even the faithful vary in their fear of Allah and the faith in Him which they hold in their hearts. In the Qur'an, Allah refer
s to people who do not believe in the following verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "The desert Arabs say, 'We believe.' Say: 'You do not believe. Say rather, 'We have become Muslim,' for faith has not yet entered into your hearts'..." }{
\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat al-Hujurat: 14). In another verse, Allah tells us that amongst believers, there may be those who remain behind, stay in the middle or forge ahead: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"Then We made Our chosen servants inherit the Book. But some of them wrong themselves; some are ambivalent; and some outdo each other in good by Allah's permission. That is the great favor" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surah Fatir: 32). 
\par Amongst these people described in the Qur'an is another group: "those who mix up their faith with wrongdoing," which means failing to separate oneself fully from ignorant morality, despite realizin
g the superiority of the true faith and being aware that there is no other way to salvation in the Hereafter than by conforming to the Qur'an. These individuals may live with their faith, but at moments when their interests are challenged or when they are
 faced with problems, may also demonstrate the behavior of unbelievers instead of behaving in accordance with the Qur'an. 
\par When speaking of such people, not only those who openly reject the instructions of the faith and demonstrate irreligious behavior shou
ld come to mind. The people concerned may conform to most provisions of the Qur'an and behave like believers throughout a large portion of their lives. On certain matters, however, they may not like to be aware that according to the Qur'an, they are in th
e wrong. Or they may not be able to understand that such is the case. Some who live as Muslims may think that some of their beliefs and actions do not conflict with the Qur'an, and that they do not venture into what is described as forbidden and sinful. 

\par For example, some people do not understand\emdash or do not want to\emdash 
that emotionalism is a character trait contrary to the morality of the Qur'an. This can be seen clearly in a number of verses. Upon the death of a relative, for instance, a Muslim realizes that the
 person has not perished but that for him eternal life is a new beginning. And if the relative was one of the faithful, he takes pleasure in hoping that he will enter Paradise. In addition, death is a part of one's destiny, predetermined by Allah. Like ev
erything else, Allah brings death for a reason. 
\par As a result, the believer knows that even in the case of a relative, there is a blessing in his death and behaves in such a way as to show his contentment. But despite being aware of this truth, many people s
how ignorant behavior when faced with death. They behave emotionally and react in an excessive manner.
\par Those who do not consider that such behavioral defects conflict with the morality of the Qur'an see no reason not to continue this behavior. At certain m
oments of their lives, they live like ignorant people, exhibiting the same characteristics, suffering the kind of troubles that believers do not suffer, prevalent amongst ignorant people. And unlike believers, they are frequently unhappy.
\par Because of this, everyone who declares, "I believe" should consider whether "living a beautiful life in this world and the Hereafter"\emdash which Allah has promised the faithful in the Qur'an\emdash 
is apparent in himself in the light of this knowledge. If, at certain moments, his life still contains unhappiness, troubles and sorrows to even a small extent, he should take this warning to heed.
\par For a person who suffers trouble and sorrow throughout his life, the solution is simple. As we are told in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "... Allah desires ease for you; He does not desire difficulty for you..." }{
\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat al-Baqara: 185).}{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234  
\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 For anyone who has any open or secret characteristic of ignorant morality remaining within him, the basic solution is to abandon this mode of living and behave in conformity to the Qu
r'an. Every person with faith in Allah and every believer who conforms to the Qur'an must approach the Book with greater sincerity and must be protected from any kind of act or thought that runs counter to the behavior of the faithful described in its ver
s
es. He should not regard the truths contained in the Qur'an as theoretical, but should apply them in practice in his life and feel and experience them at all times. He must not forget that Allah encompasses everything and that He knows all the secret emot
ions inside a person, including concealed insincerity.
\par A Muslim should not regard simply performing religious observances as sufficient and view the insincerity inside himself as insignificant. He should consider that Allah has the power to punish insinceri
ty with severe torment at any moment and that sooner or later, he will be called upon for a reckoning and treated accordingly. Everything that occurs in the world is created by Allah. All living creatures bow to Allah and act according to His instructions
. Muslims should live in submission to their destiny without forgetting these truths and knowing that in every event, there is a goodness and a blessing.
\par When a person arrives at awareness of these truths, he will see a different, beautiful life begin for him. He will understand that, up to that time, he never tasted the full flavor of the blessings that he believed were giving him pleasure\emdash 
and how ordinary are the things people believe bring them happiness, when compared to true happiness! He will realize t
hat everything from the meals he eats to the sights he sees, to the very air he breathes can bring far greater joys than he ever thought. Loving, being loved, showing moral perfection, seeing the delicate beauty in people, laughing and enjoying himself, f
riendship and conversation will take on very different flavors. His life and his worldly circumstances will, in a sense, become reminiscent of life in Paradise.
\par At this point, however, another important matter needs to be understood. When we speak of "livin
g a beautiful life," you should not take this to mean that people will experience no difficulty, for this world is a place where everyone is tested, and a person will be tested by various events until the end of his life. As Allah tells us in the verses o
f
 the Qur'an, everyone will suffer difficulties and problems. Some will be tested with hunger, some with fear, some with losses of property or loved ones. But none of these detract in the slightest from the internal tranquility or the happiness in the hear
t
 of a believer described here, because a believer submits to the destiny, seeing the benefits and blessings in events, or believes in them even if he cannot perceive them, and experiences the beauty in all this. Thinking positively about events and submit
ting to the will of Allah, the Possessor of boundless knowledge, brings lasting and genuine happiness. 
\par This book is about showing people the path to the true, heartfelt happiness and internal tranquility that is experienced by believers\emdash a blessing granted by Allah only to His sincere followers who have genuine faith.
\par Allah describes this matter as good news for believers in this world and the Hereafter:

\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat an-Nisa': 143), these people know everything in their consciences, but devia
te between ignorant morality and the morality of the Qur'an. Even though they believe, demonstrating this moral indecision causes such people to live in secret suffering.
\par Few are aware that the troubles and sorrows they experience is the recompense for the insincerity they conceal inside themselves. They believe that these are "facts of life"\emdash 
that is, a part of life that almost everybody is apt to experience. However, none of the behavior which turns to sorrow for them is an inescapable fact of life.
\par People of this type suffer sorrow and torment either because they have set their faces against the religious morality that will protect them from darkness, as Allah tells us in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

(Surah Ibrahim: 1), or because they do not live the way that religious morality requires.
\par In that case, what ideas, defective morality
, attachments and beliefs are distancing people from religious morality and causing them to demonstrate ignorant behavior? In the following lines we will answer this question and refer to the ugly behavior that turns people away from happiness.

The principal reason why some people continue to suffer the secret sorrows of an ignorant life, even though they say they believe, is their failure to follow completely the path shown by the
 Qur'an. In the Qur'an, Allah brings the faithful the good news of a beautiful life in this world. But for this, people need to follow His instructions unconditionally and live out the perfection of the morality that He approves. While living out religiou
s
 morality, if a person acts under the influence of even a single part of ignorant morality, he cannot fully achieve the beautiful life of which the Qur'an speaks. For people to be able to live the life of the world in the way the Qur'an promises, they mus
t understand that there is no lifestyle suitable for the human character other than the morality of the Qur'an.

their pride. The truth is, pride and false superiority are among the foremost factors that drive people to torment.
\par At the same time, pride is a moral defect which drives people into sin and causes them to commit many immoralities and bad acts which do not conform to the Qur'an:

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 A prideful person loves himself more than anybody else. Because o
f this, in everything that goes against his own advantage, he pushes his own passions and desires to the forefront rather than considering the approval of Allah or his own conscience. This inevitably directs him towards wickedness and low morality.
\par Though a prideful person sets himself above everyone else and always pursues his own interests, he can never find the happiness and tranquility he seeks.
\par Prideful people can never taste the many beautiful things experienced by the truly faithful. For example, the
y can never experience real love. Because they love themselves more than anyone or anything else in the world, they are unable to love others as they should. They cannot openly express the affection they feel for another, and cannot treat others with kind
ness or show them the warmth, sincerity and friendship that love requires. Because of the cold and formal character which they display, they cannot be loved by others either.
\par Prideful people cannot accept being defeated in any matter, and because their egos
 are dominant, they always damage friendships and display behavior that causes tension and unease. They cannot display an optimistic, patient, humble, forgiving and conciliatory character. They want whatever they say to always be accepted. When there is a
 
disagreement, they behave in an obstinate, stiff-necked fashion and refuse to back down. When what they want is not done, they make trouble, which all causes them to be regarded as difficult and quarrelsome. It is very difficult for them to make friendshi
ps, to have a friendly chat or experience love, friendship and superior morality. This causes them to become unloved by people around them. Their presence causes discomfort for others, and for them this is a great loss.
\par Within these people, inability to exp
erience these beautiful feelings secretly turns into a great sorrow. Although they feel a need to love and be loved, make friendships and share superior morality with others, their own pride and conceit simply prevent them from doing so. They feel a deep 
longing for these things, but cannot attain them, which causes them to continually suffer from secret sorrow.
\par Another kind of sorrow that pride causes is the fear these people have of making mistakes. Because they claim to be flawless, they also claim to be
 immune to error. As a result, they feel very troubled whenever they do make a mistake. They aim to protect their prestige in the eyes of others, instead of earning Allah's approval.
\par Having another person point out their errors or defects is very hurtful t
o their pride. In such an event, they feel shaken, thinking they have demeaned themselves and lost face in the eyes of others. For this reason, they are constantly living in fear and tension inside themselves. They cannot act as they would like and live a
 normal life. Part of their minds is always calculating, so that they behave according to the calculation instead of sincerely and from the heart. Because of this, they are under stress and always compelled to act artificially.
\par For example, where everybody is enjoying themselves, in contrast to everyone else, proud people suffer sorrow. On the one hand, they feel a great desire to join in the entertainment, but on the other, they remain aloof out of fear that they will demean th
emselves if they demonstrate undignified behavior.
\par Because of their own approach, these people are forced to live with their obstinacy in a cold and lonely world. If they were able to show a submissive character towards Allah and the faithful, all these troubles would be at an end.
\par With submission, they would acquire cheerfulness, tranquility and happiness in place of sorrow because a submissive person has no fear of making mistakes. When a mistake he's made is pointed out to him, he immediately turns toward
s Allah to ask for forgiveness and corrects his intentions and behavior. Moreover, through his devotion, he regards the correction as a blessing for him and is happy to think that it is a means of developing himself further. He sets store not on what othe
rs think of him, but on Allah's approval. Obviously the spiritual state and the life of a person who thinks like this are quite different from those of a person who suffers tension and discomfort because of his pride.
\par Never forget that pride is the basic ch
aracteristic of satan. It caused his expulsion from Paradise, his condemnation by Allah and has ensured his abode and torment in Hell. For this reason, people who forget their own feebleness with regards to the power of Allah and enter into competition wi
t
h others out of unjustified pride should fear the same rewards as satan's. Indeed Allah has pointed out that bitter torment in the Hereafter awaits people who cannot rescue themselves from the value judgments of the society of the ignorant and persist in 
their obstinacy in the name of personal honor. Allah tells us how those who pretend to worldly greatness will be called upon on that day:

by themselves. In fact, no matter what they do, it is impossible to solve anything without Allah's willing it. For this reason, a submissive person will attempt every solution and make every effort he can. But because he knows that Allah will bring about 
the outcome, he does all this calmly and comfortably.
\par The problems suffered by people who lack submis
siveness are frequently encountered in everyday life. For example, you will have often run across the rage and the angry words of a person who's missed his bus on the way to work. He cannot pull himself together for several minutes. Even if he finds anoth
e
r way of getting to work on time, he is upset by this incident throughout the day. He will become stressed and torment himself by thinking that everything will go wrong on a day that's begun badly. If instead of this, he considers the possible benefits th
at Allah may grant through this event, he would not become so troubled. He would go on hoping for Allah's approval because he surrenders himself to Allah even when everything appears to be going wrong.
\par In the same way, a person injured in an accident cannot
 be protected from the worry into which he falls when he behaves with a lack of trust in Allah towards what has befallen him. Because he has forgotten that it was Allah Who created this event, he looks for the fault in the driver of the vehicle or in hims
elf and gets angry. In fact, all his worry is entirely groundless. In such a situation, thinking about just one positive aspect of what happened is enough to rescue the person from this irreconcilable concern. 
\par For example, considering that the outcome coul
d have been not injury but death is a reason to be grateful to Allah and a source of calm and cheerfulness. Or the patient should take pleasure in thinking that injury is a means of feeling close to death and the Hereafter, and that this brings him very c
l
ose to Allah and increases his fear of Allah. Perhaps because of this he will be rescued from pride and vanity, and his submission will make Allah pleased with him. This will bring him great blessings and benefits in the Hereafter. Thus a person who belie
ves with certainty in Allah and the Day of Judgment can understand the benefits and blessings Allah has created in any situation.
\par People who have only a superficial faith may often behave with lack of submission. And because of this, in contrast with true b
elievers, their lives may be filled with troubles and sorrows. If such people submit to Allah in the way the faithful are instructed to do in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"[Believers are] those to whom people said, 'The people have gathered against you, so fear them.' But that merely increased their faith and they said, }{\b\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 'Allah is enough for us and the Best of Guardians}{

monly found within man: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "... When We let a man taste mercy from Us, he exults in it. But if something bad strikes him for what he has done, he is ungrateful" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat ash-Shura: 48). Certainly some people are ungrateful to Allah in spite of the countless ble
ssings amongst which they live. Although they may never have considered this, such poor moral behavior towards Allah is one of the principal reasons for their unhappiness. In the verse,}{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234  "Remember Me\emdash 
I will remember you. Give thanks to Me and do not be ungrateful" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat al-Baqara: 152), Allah orders people to avoid ingratitude. Despite having faith, their failure to appreciate Allah's mercy and all the fine things He has granted them will naturally grow into a torment for them.
\par The fundamental reason for th
ese people's showing such poor moral behavior is that they have not fully grasped the essence of religion. Their inability to consider the perfect structure of destiny, or that there is goodness in everything whether it appears good or bad, causes them to
 
regard events negatively. In every event, there are really hundreds of details in which a person can find a blessing and take pleasure. But because of their distorted vision, these people cannot see the blessings and be grateful as they should. Some see t
hese beautiful things which have come to them from Allah and think they own them and hence, do not show the necessary gratitude\emdash just as Qarun, who was given so much wealth that he could not even carry his keys, behaved ungratefully towards Allah.

\par As we are told, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "He [Qarun] said, 'I have only been given it because of knowledge I have...'" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat al-Qasas: 78). Such people start thinking that they deserve the things they possess. For this reason, they do not regard them as blessings that bring joy and happine
ss. Because they have not completely purged worldly ambition from their hearts, what they do possess does not seem enough for them. They show a contrary character towards their blessings because they are conceited, yet dissatisfied.
\par These people also forget that it's Allah Who gives blessings and takes them away and Who increases or reduces them. For this reason, whenever they suffer a loss, they are plunged into deep disappointment. In fact, this is one of Allah's tests\emdash 
an important learning opportunity for people to understand the true value of whatever they have.
\par People should take advantage of the opportunities that Allah provides them and try to earn Allah's approval with a grateful approach. We are told in the Qur'an that people who are ungrateful to A
llah while in the midst of His blessings may suffer the loss of those same blessings as a result. The verse which tells us this truth is:

\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "... people are prone to selfish greed..." }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat 
an-Nisa': 128). Indeed, man is prone to succumbing to selfish desires. He is ready to put himself first at every opportunity, look after his own selfish benefits and love himself above all others. If a person is not sufficiently strong-willed in his fear 
o
f Allah and in superior morality, this will prompt him to selfish desires such as "Let only me be loved," or "Let me be admired" and "Let me be praised." Such an immoral approach invariably puts the comfort, tranquility and happiness of others in second p
l
ace. Instead of thinking such self-sacrificing thoughts as, "First, let me ensure the comfort of others," or "Let it be to their advantage and if necessary, I'll sacrifice my own benefits," and "Let others be happy and let me take pleasure from their happ
iness," he will come to act with the idea of "Me first, no matter what!"
\par Believers conquer this tendency in their natures and live out the morality which Allah approves. But some people fall into the error of thinking "I already fulfill certain religious ob
ligations, what can be wrong if occasionally I look after my own interests?" and regard this as a harmless deficiency in their morality. They go further and view protecting their own advantages as "a fact of life." In other words, even though the Qur'an t
e
lls them this is wrong, they privately believe that to stay alive and prosper, they need to put their own interests first. They think that nobody else can look out for their interests and that others will suppress and harm them. Moreover, when everyone el
s
e demonstrates this morality and looks after his own interests, but one of them is generous and self-sacrificing, they believe this one is making a fool of himself. Because of these ideas, they cannot direct their thinking toward self-sacrifice. In fact, 
there is only one Power Who can protect people's advantages, and that Power is Allah. Neither selfishness nor the pursuit of his own interests can bring a person any advantage. 
\par Allah explains this in a verse:

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 People's egotism emerges most clearly through their passion for life a
nd property. For example, when a person is asked to lend something he owns, he may lie and say, "I don't have it with me," because he doesn't want to hand it over. This selfish tendency manifests itself at every stage of life. Such people want a fine meal
 
to be served to them alone. To avoid sharing it with others, they take pains to ensure that they dine when nobody else is in the house. When sharing is unavoidable, they keep the choicest parts of the meal for themselves and offer the others what is left.
 
In the same way, when there is a difficult job to be done, they use various excuses to escape doing it and try to arrange for someone else to do it. They regard their own selves as more important than anybody else's. For this reason they still seek ways o
f escaping work, even if they have nothing to do and others are very tired or busy.
\par This attitude that such people conceal in their hearts is not limited to property and food, but becomes apparent in many other subjects. One whose soul is not cleansed of eg
otism will stoop to many things. He always wants his own wishes to be carried out and his to be the last word. For example, when many others are present, he wants to listen to his choice of music and watch his choice of TV programs. He never regards the w
i
shes of others as a priority. He rushes to grab the most comfortable seat. When work is being divided up, he "volunteers" for the easiest tasks and dumps the most difficult on others. In situations that require effort or self-sacrifice, he acts slowly and
 is always one step behind. In conversation, he regards pushing himself forward as a talent, rather than behaving with humility.
\par The truth is, behaving in this way to obtain miniscule advantages pushes anyone who claims to be a believer and knows about the 
morality of the Qur'an into great hypocrisy. Insincerity always causes substantial uneasiness. A person who continually pursues his own interests must undertake massive efforts to deceive others around him. He lives with the fear that this ongoing secret 
hypocrisy will be discovered.
\par Sincere Muslims never experience such fears. We are told in the Qur'an that if need be, sincere Muslims put their lives and their goods in jeopardy to earn Allah's approval, act with no expectation of any return and put the nee
ds of other Muslims ahead of their own:

 and are setting traps for others, but really fall into their own trap. This is one of the secrets the Qur'an reveals to us. One who displays self-sacrificing morality may seem to tire himself more because he accepts more responsibilities, expends his goo

Among moral characteristics, hatred and anger play a very substantial role in causing people to fall into trouble and sorrow. In daily li

(Surat al-Ma'ida: 55). Faced with people who love Allah, seek His approval, live out the morality of the Qur'an and devote their lives to serving their 
religion, feeling such emotions as hatred or anger shows that faith has not fully taken root in a person's heart. Such insincerity towards Allah and His followers makes a person unable to live in the tranquility and happiness of faith as he should.
\par People 
like this cannot at all protect themselves against the effects of unexpected events, which, in fact, they could easily tolerate. A simple incident or somebody else's innocent mistake is enough to enrage them. Because sometimes they see only through the ey
e
s of anger, they may perceive even perfectly normal behavior as infuriating. Under anger's influence, they cannot think clearly or evaluate events fairly and objectively. More important, their momentary desire to satisfy their anger take precedence before
 
a great many other goals. Although they know that Allah wants for them to conquer their anger and behave charitably and forgivingly, being under the influence of their lower selves, they cannot keep themselves from growing angry. In the Qur'an, Allah tell
s people to }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "make allowances for people, command what is right, and turn away from the ignorant" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat al-A'raf: 199). Because of this, a believer seeking Allah's approval will forgive the faults of his brothers and sisters among the faithful, even if they made serious mistakes.
\par Moreover, these people shouldn't deceive themselves by hiding their hatred and anger inside and not showing it outwardly. What Allah wants is for people not to feel these emotions, even secretly. They also forget that Allah knows wh

oncealing any number of secret thoughts in their hearts. Because their internal and external behaviors are contradictory, these people find it extremely difficult to behave naturally and sincerely from within. They are always concealing and simulating, tr
y
ing to deceive others by putting on an act. For this reason their expressions are not authentic, their voices are not their natural tones, and what they say seldom reflects their true thoughts. Because of their pretended behavior, it is impossible for suc
h
 people to form relationships. They cover up their real characters and try to keep secret their real opinions about others, their true interpretations of events, and their own weaknesses, ambitions and desires. Even when their affected behavior and the si
t
uation in which they find themselves is explained to them and they are asked to be sincere, still they respond with the same affected reactions. As a result, it's never possible to understand these people's true character and discover their real ideas. In
 consequence, it's hard to be comfortable around them because anyone who covers up his real self may behave unexpectedly and badly at any time.
\par By contrast, one of the main characteristics of a believer is trustworthiness. What affords him this trustworthin
ess is his fearing Allah, taking refuge in Him, and his sincere effort to correct any mistakes or defects instead of trying to hide them. Behavior contrary to this is first of all, insincerity towards Allah and secondly, hypocrisy toward other people.

\par Hypo
crisy brings pain because it is as difficult and troublesome as sincerity is easy and comfortable. Insincerity requires that a person put on an act throughout life, without a moment's respite. Concentrating to maintain the unnecessary pose and continually
 
planning and calculating are very difficult. In the same way, curbing the genuine desires that arise from within and never living a natural life drive people into serious suffering. To turn the bad thoughts in their hearts into positive thinking, adopt su
perior morality and ideas and as a result, be unhesitating in behaving sincerely, naturally and comfortably is much easier than to live that way. 
\par Merely imitating a religious and moral life, while pretending genuine sincerity towards Allah, causes those wh
o do so to suffer loss in this world and the Hereafter. Because of this, nothing should be left in a person's heart which is not in keeping with the Qur'an. One should behave with the utmost sincerity, directness and honesty towards Allah and His follower

This is a serious behavioral defect that arises from devotion to worldly life. Allah tells us that such an emotion is lodged in the human soul in this verse of the Qur'an: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"Or do they in fact envy other people for the bounty Allah has granted them? ..." }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat an-Nisa': 54). We are told that for human salvation, it is necessary to cleanse the soul of such evil: }{
\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "He who purifies it has succeeded" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat ash-Shams: 9). The contrary, that such an evil in the soul drives people to destruction, is made clear in the verse, }{
\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "He who covers it up has failed" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat ash-Shams: 10). The damage and torment that envy brings down on people in this world clearly demonstrate the form which the failure referred to by the verse may take in this world.
\par Among the ignora
nt, the view of envy is very different from that given in the Qur'an. People assume that envy is a natural human characteristic, present in everybody to a greater or lesser degree. They regard as strange people who say, "I am not at all envious." As for t
hemselves, they are jealous of almost everything possessed by the people they live near: their intelligence, appearance, goods, children, houses, jobs, and so on.
\par Instead of sharing in their pleasure, envious people feel uncomfortable at others' virtue, bea
uty and success. Their resentfulness leaves them deeply saddened by the blessings that others enjoy. This inward emotion can even make them want to harm others. Because of this, in the Qur'an Allah warns the faithful:

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 The faithful know that this characteristic
, harbored by ignorant people, is basically bad. In contrast, they praise others' good characteristics and pray to Allah for the good and the benefit of one another. Actually, anyone who knows the Qur'an and lives out its morality cannot contemplate doing
 
otherwise. But in spite of this, some people say they do believe, but cannot achieve this moral approach. Such people do not regard envy as natural, as in the community of the ignorant who defend it openly. Yet they are driven in this direction by the bla
ndishments of their own lower selves. Some deceive themselves by thinking that in certain situations, feeling this emotion is natural and not contrary to the Qur'an. 
\par For example, as a natural desire\emdash and one which is in accordance with the Qur'an\emdash they want 
to be foremost amongst the faithful in matters of affection, friendship and reliability. Of course, any believer wants to gain the affection, friendship and trust of Allah and His faithful followers, as much as possible. But to the same extent, he also wa
n
ts other believers to acquire these blessings. If another can demonstrate morality superior to his own, then he should praise and admire him. Envy has no place in the morality of the faithful. But envious people may confuse admiring others with being jeal
ous of them.
\par For every one of these people, becoming familiar with religious morality brings an understanding of the clear distinction between good and evil and right and wrong. The verses of the Qur'an show people and their consciences what arises from env
y, and what from natural desires. Despite this, some go on deceiving themselves by methods all based on their insincerity towards Allah. Although they could live in the tranquil morality of the believers, their insincerity forces them to secretly experien
c
e the torment of living out the morality of the ignorant. People who keep envy alive in their hearts live in a world that's perpetually unhappy. The very existence of others who are more attractive and more talented, and the praise and affection granted t
o those people by others, cause them sorrow and suffering\emdash because they do not know how to be satisfied with the blessings Allah has given them, nor how to be grateful and consequently, happy.
\par The only way to be rescued from these secret torments is to clean
se one's soul of such bad characteristics and evaluate everything according to the verses of the Qur'an. Anyone who can do this knows that the real owner of all the good things of life, of all goods and property, is Allah; and that in the world, Allah tes
ts people's morality by granting them these things in different measures. Because he acts in the light of this truth, every beautiful thing can become a pleasant blessing for him.

hey believe that once they have deceived and convinced others, no problem remains. But in fact, the whole of human responsibility is to Allah. In the Qur'an, Allah instructs people to avoid lying in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"... have done with telling lies" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat al-Hajj: 30). No matter how clever a lie may be or how well it deceives others, Allah knows the truth and He sees that the person is lying.
\par Believers know that lying is a type of behavior which Allah has forbidden and they strongly abstain from telling falsehood
s on even the most trivial matter. But some in their ignorant lives, influenced by their own selfish drives, persist in this moral defect which should be left behind. When asked, these people will naturally deny that they would ever do anything at all tha

\par A person telling a lie, who knows this is forbidden by Allah, may at first believe that he has protected himself or gained something, but this is not true. Lying t
roubles a person's conscience and makes him uncomfortable. Such a person always remains afraid that his lies will be discovered and that as a result, other people will demean him. He lives with this tension all the time. Deep inside, he feels uncomfortabl
e
 because he knows he has done something forbidden by Allah. Furthermore, once a person tells a lie, he feels the need to tell more lies, one after another, in order not to let his first lie be discovered. Each time he is drawn deeper into the swamp of fal
sehoods and feels stress in his heart because he cannot escape from it. 
\par In addition, liars are suspected right away by those around them and as a result, are neither trusted nor respected. This makes a liar feel even lower. People who tell lies to exalt an

Emotionalism is a significant factor that makes people lead troubled lives. It is not in conformity with the approach instructed by Allah 
in the Qur'an, but most people do not notice its danger. Indeed most of the time, being emotional attracts others' praise, admiration and encouragement. It is deemed to be a manifestation of affection, whereas in fact it creates torment within people who 
a
re distanced from the morality of the Qur'an. True affection is a genuine and sincere emotion which is shown with neither hesitation nor conceit. As for emotionalism, it springs from concealing affection or from directing toward people the love which ough
t to be felt for Allah. Those who behave in this way nurture feelings that border on the idolatrous toward those whom they love. Because of this, they live in constant anxiety.
\par Emotionalism is contrary to religion. The Qur'an brings people the ability to ob
serve events objectively and interpret them logically. Emotionalism, on the other hand, distances people from reality, pushes them into illogical thinking, and directs into making wrong decisions. For people who grasp faith and the morality of the Qur'an,
 there is no positive side to emotionalism. They realize that this mindset drives people into sorrow, disappointment and harm. Because of this, they permit no such weakness in their hearts, either openly or secretly.
\par People of faith who are unaware that the
se aspects of emotionalism are contrary to the Qur'an or who place no importance on them may show weakness in this matter. Sometimes they merely keep it concealed inside themselves, and other times let it openly control their behavior. 
\par One of its clearest indications is an uncontrollable tendency to cry, from sorrow over something a person cannot cope with and from failure to submit with heartfelt calm and gratification to whatever destiny Allah has created.
\par Under the influence of emotionalism, these peopl
e have a permanently sorrowful appearance. They will definitely find something in every event they experience to upset and discomfort them. Because of this, they live with a continual tendency towards weeping, but a person's tears should not be all that c
o
mes to mind. Sometimes they cry with genuine tears, but sometimes go on weeping even though not shedding tears physically. This is the wailing of the body. In this spiritual state, a person's eyes may moisten slightly. A certain pallor caused by sorrow sh
o
ws itself on their faces. There is no strength or life in their voices. Their looks are stiff and grieving. There is a heaviness and weariness about them, and a deep hopelessness prevails in their speech. Their bodies cannot perform functions as they shou
l
d because of intense stress. For this reason, such people suffer not only spiritual depression but serious physical problems as well. At times, when they are deep in this spiritual state, even were the world's greatest blessings offered to them, they woul
d be unable to take any pleasure from them. None of them will be effective in rescuing them from their sorrow. While they could live in the calm and comfort of faith and submission, they create a world full of pain for themselves with their own efforts.

\par In the Qur'an Allah reveals the following with regard to unbelievers: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "Let them laugh little and weep much... " }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat at-Tawba: 82).}{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234  
}{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 That is, crying, grieving and feeling sorrow are characteristic of unbelievers. In the same way, verses of the Qur'an often r
efer to the unhappiness and miserable state of unbelievers and the trouble-filled lives they lead. In the Qur'an, the faithful are encouraged to be cheerful always; and a great many verses give them good news about matters that will bring them joy in this
 
world and the Hereafter. This being the case, if a person who professes faith is continually filled with sorrow or is in a spiritual state tending towards the tearful, this indicates that he is superficially evaluating a number of matters, including submi
ssion to Allah, and is not in a truly religious state of mind.
\par For these reasons, a person who says he has faith should not regard grieving and being sorrowful as normal for any reason. Rather than give way to such feelings he should take refuge in Allah. H
e should not regard living a life of such torment as natural, when it is possible to be friends with Allah and live in tranquility by trusting in Him. As Allah points out in the Qur'an, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"They will say, 'Our Lord, our miserable destiny overpowered us. We were misguided people. Our Lord, remove us from it! Then if we revert again, we will definitely be wrongdoers" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat al-Muminun: 106-107), we should take warning from the situation of people, defeated by unhappiness in the life of this world, who enter the Hereafter in a state of regret. We should aim to attain a true and unshakable faith.

Another behavioral defect that causes people to suffer sorrow is irritability. Irritable people may become offended at any event they witness or any
thing they hear under the influence of the spiritual state they are in, even though there is no justification for such a reaction. The words spoken may have nothing to do with them. Or because of their irritability, such people may completely misunderstan
d what is said to them. Instead of seeing the sense in what is said, they draw totally unwarranted conclusions and use these to fuel their resentment.
\par Those around them cannot understand why irritable people behave as they do because they seldom say openly 
what they are vexed about, what is upsetting them. Other bystanders try various methods of working out the problem, but most of the time they cannot figure out why these people have been offended.
\par One of the reasons for such people's irritability is that t
hey do not regard those around them as friends and do not trust them. Invariably they interpret others' words and behavior as hostile. Another reason is these people's lack of tranquility and the insincerity inside. Because they are aware of their own uns
crupulousness, they think others may notice it and throw it up to them at any moment.

as though they did and from this, try to derive an undeserved advantage. By sulking, they want to make the person they are speaking with feel sorry and back down. Believers do not stoop to such methods. In the morality of the Qur'an, if the other person b

haves ignorantly, wrongly or thoughtlessly, there is still no reason for irritability or sulk: A believer knows that every event, every act and every word has been created according to the destiny predetermined by Allah. Behaving badly in spite of this is
 a mistake committed against Allah. In addition, the faithful know that tolerant, forgiving and affectionate behavior is necessary for Allah's approval.

 loosen their attachment to the world. Considering that life is very short; that one can lose it unexpectedly at any moment for any reason; and that prized qualities such as beauty, wealth and respect can be wiped out at any time will place on these world
ly things only the value they deserve. As a result, one will understand the irrationality of desiring temporal possessions and direct himself towards gaining Allah's approval and eternal life in the Hereafter.
\par At times, this habit of avoidance from thought\emdash common in ignorant societies\emdash 
can be observed even in people who claim to be believers. Of course, their outlook on life differs greatly from those people of the ignorant societies. But in spite of understanding the true nature of the life of the world, the
y err in not living this truth as they should. They know perfectly well that they should not be ambitious in any matter concerning the life of the world and that their lives will end within 60 to 70 years, at most. They are also aware that they must make 
an effort towards the eternal life in the Hereafter and take every opportunity to tell this to others. However, they fail to adopt this realization into their daily lives.
\par An example will illustrate. One who buys a brand-new car may take every opportunity t
o admit that it is only one of the fleeting blessings of worldly life and thus, it's unreasonable to be passionate about this car. However, in case someone wants to borrow the car in an emergency, he may forget what he has said and succumb to a protective
 passion for his car. Though he has condemned such behaviors at every opportunity up till then, he fails to act correctly when faced with such a test in real life.
\par These people ignore these moral matters when they conflict with their interests, despite thei
r consciences' awareness. This causes serious trouble with their conscience, and a spiritual torment brought about by these people's failure to live what they know to be right. Therefore, they continually experience a troubled spiritual state.
\par Aging, illne
ss, loss of property and others' respect are major causes of tension for anyone with worldly passions. A person who keeps in mind that he will die one day and can take none of his money and property with him cannot feel a passion for anything. He uses eve
rything generously in the way Allah approves; he concentrates on the eternal life of the Hereafter rather than the fleeting life of this world and works towards this end.

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 One issue that draws people into trouble and unseen torment is their self-deception and belief in the world's
 falsehoods. By inculcation, a person can persuade himself that something he wants to be true, really is. Since he interprets events in a way as he wishes to view them, he comes to believe in his own interpretations\emdash 
so much so that even when those offering a different opinion are clearly telling the truth, he thinks that they are committing an error.
\par For example, by one's own self-inculcation, a person may come to think that his friends do not love him enough. Through such interpretations of every incident,
 he may create plenty of evidence that he is right. Even if people make satisfactory explanations and perform acts that ought to prove the contrary, a person who has convinced himself that he is right respects none of them. He uses every detail to reinfor
c
e his own assumptions and even makes up imaginary evidence to convince himself of what he wants to believe. The fact is, however, that the person in question views the world as he wants to and interprets events as he likes. For this reason, he lives in co
ntinual torment.
\par This characteristic can be observed in most people in ignorant societies, but may also be seen in believers who have not fully established faith in their hearts and who fail to interpret every incident in their lives according to the Qur'an
. Failure to interpret events in the light of the Qur'an always drives people into error. Where they do not take the Qur'an as their guideline, people make decisions according to the ignorant society's viewpoint. That is to say, they will side with their 
s
elfish desires and the satan's. As a result, they view every event around them, including their perceptions about themselves, in a twisted way that arises principally from their own self-deception. For example, a person regarded to be heedless according t
o
 the morality of the Qur'an may consider himself to be very kind, according to his ignorant viewpoint. Alternatively, one who behaves arrogantly according to the Qur'an's definition may think himself to be very humble and submissive, since he fails to mea
s
ure his behavior by the Qur'an and think in its terms. In the same way, those of weak faith may convince themselves they fear Allah, are wholly and purely committed to the morality of the Qur'an and are completely honest and sincere towards Him. However, 
a
t this stage, people have a number of irrational judgments contrary to the Qur'an that they employ to convince themselves and suppress their consciences. Rationalizing these flawed judgments within themselves, they convince themselves that they do not fal
l afoul of the religion and that their excuses will be accepted in the sight of Allah. Such an attitude distances people from sincerity.
\par The claims and attitudes of people who deceive themselves prove to be incompatible, for they also claim to be pious Musl
ims. But such an attitude always causes them trouble. Subconsciously aware of their true lack of moral perfection, they endure constant pangs of conscience. Nevertheless, instead of taking notice of these and correcting the flaws in their behavior, they p
refer to deceive themselves and cover up their mistakes. This in turn causes them material and spiritual harm.

Another harm brought by insincerity, this weariness results from the pressure they place upon themselves by kno
wingly ignoring their conscience. The spiritual torment produced by a troubled conscience deeply affects both their spiritual state and physical functions. Even if such people live in the most comfortable homes, acquire everything they want, live among pe
ople with moral perfection and possess the highest levels of health and beauty, they still cannot be rescued from this trouble. They cannot enjoy as they should any of the blessings around them. 
\par Neither a delicious meal, nor candid talk of a friend, nor a 
beautiful landscape give them any pleasure. Deep inside, they feel grief in environments where others laugh and enjoy themselves. No matter how they imitate the happiness and cheer of those around them, their inner spiritual torment never leaves them, not
 
for a moment. Never can they experience the cheerfulness or tranquility that others feel. They can achieve these only through special efforts of will and concentration. As a result they always feel a weariness that causes them to live in a kind of stupor 
even when their bodies are awake. The way they look at things clearly express their weariness.
\par Their eyes are open, but have a dull and torpid look, and they are far from the signs of alertness apparent in a believer. 
\par The weariness caused by this spiritual
 pressure also has major physical effects. Such people lack keen perception, speech, coordination and other skills. They are physically capable, but the pressure and dullness in their brains prevent them from leading a normal life. At a subconscious level
, they always feel the discomfort stemming from a troubled conscience. As long as they fail to resolve this unrest, they cannot feel at ease. 
\par In the Qur'an, Allah describes the troubled spiritual state of such people who have not fully placed faith in their hearts as follows:

In this verse of the Qur'an, we are told of another form of harm that insincerity inflicts people: }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "... He casts uncleanness on those who do not use their intellect." (Surah Yunus: 100)
\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Allah repays those who do not exercise their consciences or remain sincere to Allah, with a curse described in the Qur'an as "uncleanness." In one verse, Allah reveals, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"But as for those with sickness in their hearts, it adds uncleanness to their uncleanness, and they die while they are unbelievers" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat at-Tawba: 125). By Allah's will, this can be see
n in people in the form of both physical and spiritual impurity. If He wishes, such people may indeed take on a dirty appearance. The lack of tranquility and stress they experience may cause their skin to deteriorate much faster than normal and also cause
 bad breath and body odors.
\par Meanwhile, even if these people take all physical precautions and take great care in their personal hygiene, they cannot save themselves from spiritual impurity, and always give the impression of being dirty. Of course, this is a
n impression created by Allah as a return for their insincerity. No matter how clean they may be, even sitting where they have sat, sharing their food and handling objects they have previously touched may disturb others. This can in turn become a source o
f
 inner distress for them. Such people have forgotten Allah and chosen to pursue the approval of others. But the very people whose goodwill they sought, now avoid them and look down on them. This is a secret curse with which Allah afflicts people who do no
t live in the true faith, even though their consciences tell them to do so.

Another aspect of the spiritual impurity referred to in the verse quoted above is a lack of illumination in the faces of insincere people. This lack does n
ot manifest itself in the same way in everyone. In some faces, it makes itself known through the absence of the lively, eager and honest expressions that appear on the faces of the faithful. In others it appears as the impression of aimlessness and emptin
ess. In still others, it takes the form of a darkening that comes about with no obvious reason. All these indicate the darkness of spirit these people experience inside.
\par What is striking is that this darkness has nothing to do with physical beauty. In case 
of insincerity towards Allah, the most beautiful face, the most flawless skin or the best-shaped eyes cannot compensate for a lack of light in the facial expression. That is because such light is a characteristic Allah grants only to those who believe wit
h a sincere heart. Allah tells us this in a verse of the Qur'an:

h
eir tormented faces and troubled voices make others perceive this clearly. So long as they are insincere and do not show steadfast honesty towards Allah, they cannot overcome this. They can do whatever they want to appear sympathetic to the people around 
them, but it will have no positive effect.
\par This is a miraculous situation which Allah creates. Some may not be able to describe this negative feeling at times, but most recognize such people and avoid them. This is one of the internal torments that afflict a person who harbors negative thoughts.

\par However, keep in mind that from the moment a person purifies his heart and acts with sincere intent towards Allah, by the will of Allah, this negative appearance melts away and is replaced by a bright and open visage.

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 People who harbor immorality in their hearts make every effort to conceal it from the faithful. Their apparent way o
f life, speech, behavior, the things they do and the way they lead their lives all resemble those of the pious. Indeed, they do not seem very different, for they conceal their immorality and secretly experience the suffering that it entails. Despite this,
 
however, some of their attitudes reveal the different spiritual state they experience. Strikingly, it is not only the believers who notice this situation. Though lacking concrete evidence, within a short while, even a person who has adopted the ignorant s
o
ciety's beliefs can form an idea of whether someone is sincere or not. This is a truth known in every society. For instance, as well as using evidence, a judge bases his verdict about an accused on his behavior and his words, the way he speaks, his eyes a
nd the opinion others form about him. In the same way, even if there exists no evidence against him, a guilty person's eyes, speech and behavior cause an ineffable discomfort in other people and make them believe he may be guilty.
\par While hiring employees, as
 well as considering applicants' backgrounds, companies also interview the candidates. During the course of these interviews, the answers they receive and their observations about an applicant's behavior provide the authorities with enough information to 
form an impression of the candidate's appetite for work, his discipline and reliability. Thus the impression formed during the interview becomes influential in accepting or rejecting the candidate. 
\par This is also the case with believers, who recognize a pers
on who may display insincere attitudes in some particular situations. In fact, because they think according to the Qur'an, with the wisdom and perception granted to them by Allah, believers can form more accurate opinions. Trying to explain these judgment
s
 to others, they may fail to provide concrete evidence to prove their point, for these are matters that cannot be clearly expressed. This talent for discernment can be referred to as a "sixth sense." With it, people feel whether a person is sincere, merel
y by the inspiration of Allah.
\par Even if an insincere person is no different from believers in how he eats, drinks, laughs and talks, and exhibits no irritating behavior, still the faithful can sense the difference in him. Here, indeed, the term "negative vib
es" widely used in society, finds its full impact. The faithful realize the negative spiritual state distanced from the morality of the Qur'an of these people from the negative impressions they give off\emdash 
since unlike believers, they do not enjoy a tranquil, sincere, relaxed and comfortable spiritual state.
\par The difference in their speech is another sign that the sixth sense can detect. In insincere people's speech, there may be nothing out of the ordinary. They may say almost exactly the same things as believ
ers, but in their manner of speaking, a difference still becomes discernible. There is a tension in their tone of voice, the way the words come out, their flow and modulation that creates serious discomfort in the hearts of the sincere. In addition, such 
behavior as trying to push themselves to the fore among speakers, using expressions that pander to their ego and speaking according to a negative plan in their heads give them away.
\par These people's negative aspects are felt by everyone in the room. When asked their opinions, these others seem to share the same opinion as everybody else. Common opinions about a person can be important in detecting insincerity.
\par People usually take the phrase "sixth sense" to mean seeing into the future, knowing about events bef
ore they happen, giving information about the unseen, and similar other things which are impossible without the will of Allah. As we are told in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"The keys of the Unseen are in His possession. No one knows them but Him..." }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surat al-Anam: 59), no
 one other than Allah can know the unseen. What is meant by "the sixth sense" here is different: Felt by Allah's will, it makes one sense events that are happening at that moment, and not in the future. 
\par }{\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 For this reason, by Allah's will, it is impossible f
or a person to conceal his insincerity from the faithful. According to the Qur'an's morality, what befits a person in such a situation is to set forth honestly whatever is defective or mistaken in one's heart. This way, it is much easier to compensate for
 mistakes and attain sincerity by the support of the faithful. Otherwise, every concealed insincerity will bring yet another and further distance the sufferer from the morality of the Qur'an.
\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Another point deserves mention here. By their sixth sense, the fa
ithful can sense the immorality and insincerity of others. However, the faithful remain aware that humans can always err and their hearts are in Allah's hands. They make no accusations against these people out of their consciences and sense of justice. A 
n
egative impression sensed is only a feeling, not evidence. In such a situation, a believer seized by such an impression takes any necessary measures to avoid possible harm. But he will never arrive at a judgment about someone's heart or accuses him of ins
incerity. For so long as a person does not openly confess, only Allah knows what is in his heart.}{\f0\insrsid2565081

 upon themselves by concealing the unseemly ideas and spiritual state they experience. For this reason, if a believer feels even a trace of insincerity in another, he simply invites that person to the morality of the Qur'an without judging him in any way.
 He reminds him that to all types of secret sorrow and trouble, lack of tranquility and unhappiness, the sole solution is to live out a morality approved by Allah.}{\f0\insrsid2565081

\par However, if a 
believer makes an effort on behalf of the other, determines his weaknesses for him, thinks about ways of overcoming them and presents these in an encouraging manner so as to make them seem easy, it can be of great benefit. Such judgments made by a believe
r
 who fears Allah always accord with the Qur'an: They are honest and sincere. Moreover, with an eye which can evaluate objectively, this believer can clearly identify defects of behavior and faith that the person himself has been unable to, and thus help h
is brother on this matter. Because a sincere Muslim gives warnings for encouragement, what he says is always extremely important and should be taken seriously.
\par Nevertheless some people, though well aware of these facts, do not accept criticism. But as we know from the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "In fact, man will be clear proof against himself. In spite of any excuses he might offer" }{

into believing the contrary, in his conscience he knows the truth. Not applying realities known by the conscience to life causes internal strife, and is definitely one of t

hey react to the warnings in ways that do not accord with the Qur'an\emdash 
which, in fact, constitutes a second proof of the accuracy of what is said to them. That is because a sincere believer, when invited to an even better morality, accepts this invitation.

 the things he wants the least is for believers, by gaining true sincerity, to achieve a morality that Allah will approve. For this reason, when people are summoned to the true faith, satan will definitely try to influence them in the opposite direction.

\par O
ne of satan's efforts towards this end is preventing people from thinking. For this purpose, satan does his best to steer people into defending themselves and finding excuses for their mistakes. A person who is under his influence begins to feel angry wit
h
 believers who warn him and thinks he's suffering an injustice. In addition, since he realizes that when he thinks he will clearly see the realities and be forced to confess his insincerity, he completely shuts down his thinking process. A person whose mi
nd is infected with this type of insincerity cannot correct his mistakes by thinking matters through.
\par As a result of their condition, people in question pay attention only to those unhealthy thoughts that cross their minds. They form fixed ideas in complian
ce with their own opinions and for this reason, try not to listen to, hear or understand what is said to them. No matter how effective or striking another person's words may be, they do not change the thoughts in their closed minds. Satan intensifies thei
r
 avoidance to such an extent that, even when things are pointed out to them with verses of the Qur'an, they do not think about them or even want to think about them. When reminded about Allah's existence, that they will be called on to account for their a
ctions, that He sees everything and that the payback for their behavior may be the eternal torments of Hell, they arrive at a heedlessness and a mental vacuum that will not allow these truths to affect them.
\par In this way, they willfully close their minds to 
admonitions. But deep inside, they certainly know that they are wrong. Because of this, they condemn their consciences to live in trouble and lack of tranquility. They want to live lives dictated by their selves' desires\emdash 
which is surely a life far removed 
from the teachings of the Qur'an. Meanwhile, they are also aware that such a lifestyle may cause them great disappointment in this world and the Hereafter. As a result, they spend their lives in internal conflict, foreboding and worry.
\par Such a heedless atti
tude is not to be found in people of faith. Contrary to this behavior, the reaction of the faithful to a warning is to consider it and learn from it. This is pointed out in many verses of the Qur'an, and mentioned in the Surat al-A'la. In these verses, Al
lah tells us that thinking and taking advice are characteristics of people who fear Him in their hearts:

The reactions of those who cannot completely rescue themselves when invited to sincerity, even though they say they believe, mak
e themselves evident to a large extent in defects of the voice, manner of speaking and expression. As we have mentioned, they may place great importance on their image in the eyes of others, though they know very well that what is most important is to ear
n
 the approval of Allah. Being the target of criticism and having their errors detected are among the things that damage this image the most. Because of this, when they find themselves in circles where this occurs, they display different voices, speech and
 expressions that are inappropriate to the morality of the faithful. To list these reactions when their insincerity is discovered:

No doubt, people's voices are one of the most important means by which they reflect their emotions and thoughts to the outside world. Most of the time, whether they want to or not, they make their joy, pleasure, affection, interest, fears and concerns
\emdash or their tranquility and comfort\emdash apparent through their tone of voice.
\par Faced with a warning about
 his Afterlife, a person who lives the morality of the Qur'an tries to understand and implement what he is told with pleasure and eagerness. That pleasure can be easily recognized in his voice. But in the case of an insincere person, no matter how much he
 
tries to hide the tension he feels because his insincerity has been discovered, sometimes his voice reflects this. The natural, strong, lively, flowing, easy and healthy voice he uses in everyday life gives way to a tone which is uncomfortable, stiff, col
d
, choked, hoarse, strangled and troubled and is very difficult to understand. In such circumstances, the manner of speaking he uses is not the one normally adopted, and especially not during cheerful moments. The best way of judging this is to compare the
 
person's voice with the tone he adopts when served a dish he likes very much, when a favorite piece of music is playing, or when he is given something he wants very much. In general, a person's normal tone is one he uses when he is cheerful and at peace. 
The loss of this tone when he is given advice or a warning\emdash that is, when an environment places a strain on him\emdash results from his harboring negative thoughts inside. 
\par Of course, all these details in a person's voice have meaning and contain a message. He send
s the impression that he is not happy about the criticism, wants the subject closed right away and otherwise, will put an end to his conversation with the other person and distance himself. By this means, he is implying that if the person he's talking wit
h uncovers his defects and mistakes, his spiritual state will be disturbed and he will lose his normal peace of mind\emdash so that the other should not go on talking about him in this way and should even take a step back.
\par No matter how much he may seem to be sayi
ng positive things, such a person using this voice may in fact be saying the exact opposite. This is the "rejection tone of voice." Although he may seem to agree, he is not of the same opinion in his heart. This is one of the most significant signs of the
 
secret insincerity we have been discussing from the start. It can be realized very clearly from his tone of voice that he does not agree with what's being said to him, is not convinced by the explanations and not pleased by the criticism. But because his 
words seem to be an acceptance of what he's being told, it's impossible to explain anything to him or persuade him that what he's done is wrong. The person already knows this and is applying this satanic tactic as a way of making a concealed protest.

\par Howeve
r, someone who sincerely wants to correct his mistakes and desires to achieve moral perfection expresses his humility, submission and acceptance in the best possible way with his attitude and voice. By speaking in accordance with the Qur'an with a warm an
d sincere tone, he demonstrates behavior that inspires trust in the one he's talking to.
\par The negative behavior of people of the opposite sort springs from their desire to continue their immorality and make other people feel troubled. But never forget that s
omeone who distances himself from the morality of the Qur'an causes the greatest harm to himself. If he is invited to faith, warned with verses from the Qur'an and can see for himself what is correct but still secretly persists in his insincerity, he dese
rves secret torment in the life of the world and the torment of Hell in the Hereafter.

Some exhibit serious defects in their chain of logic. Most of the time, they themselves are not aware of this collapse of logic, which is readily apparent to others. For example, while trying to p

One of believers' most important characteristics is that the morality of the Qur'an governs them at every moment; and that their every word conforms to the verses of the Qur'an.
\par Some insincere people who r
eceive advice may avoid referring to the Qur'an or mentioning Allah's name, for if they did, they know that they would have to live what they say. For instance, when one of their defects is pointed out to them, if they express the attitude of the faithful
 referred to in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
"[People who guard against evil are] those who, when they act indecently or wrong themselves, remember Allah and ask forgiveness for their bad actions (and who can forgive bad actions except Allah?) and do not knowingly persist in what they were doing" }{
\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surah Al 'Imran: 135), then, in compliance with the Qur'an, they should immediately abandon their insincerity. In the same way, if even for a moment they remember and declare that there is no being other than Allah
\emdash that they are imp
otent in the face of the power of Allah, that everything proceeds according to the destiny Allah has determined, that He knows what is in the inmost depths of their hearts, that people are tormented in this world and the Hereafter in return for their insi
ncerity, that Hell is eternal and that the pain there is real and lasting\emdash 
then they can hardly demonstrate the courage to persist in their immorality. In such a situation, a person can no longer pursue his own selfish ideas or use a manner of speaking arisi
ng from ignorance. Everything is turned on its head and he can no longer satisfy his lower self's desires. All his behavior, his manner of speaking and his tone of voice return to normal. He cannot practice deception or become irritable or protest toward 
the other person. No matter how hard on his pride, no matter how contrary to the image he believes he has created, he must admit his mistakes and take the effort to overcoming them, wasting no time.
\par For people who avoid thinking in accordance with the Qur'an, Hell is one of the most important reminders to make them think. When asked a question like, "If you were on the edge of Hell and were to be thrown into it or rescued\emdash

\par Such an analogy dramatizes that most people's insincerity arises from their inability to foresee Allah's torment or their lack of a firm belief in the Hereafter. In a verse of the Qur'an, Allah warns such people:

Another characteristic of some who are 
determined in their insincerity attracts attention: Sometimes, rather than trying to understand what is said to them, they react by protesting vehemently and defending themselves. A believer should listen to comments made about him or advice offered, ask 
questions and try to learn and understand. Later, such a person shows that he has understood the warning he's received and makes a sincere effort according to the Qur'an. But such an effort is seldom observed in the kind of character we are talking about.

\par Allah offers the exemplary behavior of the Prophet Yusuf (as) as an example to the faithful in the Qur'an. Despite being faced with a calumny, the Prophet Yusuf (as) knew that he should not defend his lower self. One verse quotes him as follows:

Another reaction that reveals insincerity is when people who normally display a lively, cheerful character and engage in sustained, warm conversations, are confronted with criticism. Suddenly they fall silent and seem unable to speak. Believers in the tru
e faith lose none of their eager willpower, even under the most difficult circumstances. On the contrary, such circumstances make them more eager still and they show the strength of their faith by making even greater efforts.
\par In such circumstances, of cours
e, people who prefer to remain silent rather than provide satisfactory explanations do so as a protest. In this way, they want to wear down the believer who is warning them. But when they are told that this behavior is unseemly, they offer the excuse that
 they said nothing because nothing crossed their minds. 
\par Behavior of this type is carried out cunningly and cannot be proved. Again, it can be detected and recognized only with the sixth sense. An insincere person takes advantage of the lack of proof and co
ntinues his protest. But with this ugly obstinacy, he loses both Allah's approval and the trust, respect and affection of the faithful. Because of his crafty plans, the person in question has an extremely confused spiritual state. He lives with a troubled
 conscience, knowing that what he's done is insincere, and lives with continual tension and discomfort. This, too, is one of the torments given by Allah to people who practice insincerity.

People who forget that Allah knows what is hidde

vior. They also use affected attitudes and speech to hide from people what they want to keep secret. Allah refers to people like this in a verse of the Qur'an:

Of course, maintaining this hypocritical spiritual state consistently is extremely difficult. For a person to seem to feel things he does not experience requires a great expenditure of effort. People who maintain this extremely w
earying behavior create troubles for themselves.
\par When advice is given them, they pretend\emdash with exaggerated gestures and emphases and long and detailed explanations\emdash to have accepted what has been said. Most of the time, they truly are thinking the exact oppo

\par People who practice this deceit believe that they have cleared and protected themselves at the time, but Allah kn

To render advice given them ineffective, some resort to using a contrary manner of speaking. In this way they deceive themselves, believing that they can dissuade Muslims who enjoin the good and forbid evil. They deceive themselves because\~
a pious Muslim is responsible only for revealing truths. Another's reaction cannot affect his behaving in accordance with Allah's approval.
\par These two-faced people use contrariness in the same cunning way as their other behavioral ploys. They try not to give away too many indications or too much evidence of what they really think.
\par Above all, there is a concealed obstinacy in their speech. With the support of barely perceptible gestures and emphases, they secretly defy the person they are talking with. At first hearing, their words may seem respectful and reasonable. However, their 
way of saying these words, the emphases they use, the toughness in their expressions and their inappropriate gestures give the impression that they're really contradicting those they're talking to.
\par In the morality of the Qur'an, there is no place for contr
ary behavior, whether open or secret. One of the most important characteristics distinguishing the faithful from the ignorant is their gentle, humble, submissive patience and compassion. The only power that can grant these qualities to people is the fear 
of Allah. For this reason, anyone who engages in secret contrariness should abandon this right away by fearing Allah to his utmost, taking refuge in Him, and demonstrating a gentle and submissive morality.

Another indicator of
 character, emotions, thoughts and level of sincerity is people's expressions in their eyes. Most of what a person experiences inside, what he hides in his heart and what passes through his mind is reflected in his expression. This is a truth well known b

problem or as a means to help the other person overcome his defects, become better and earn eternal life in the Hereafter. Since insincere people evaluate events not from the viewpoint of the Qur'an, but using the criteria of the ignorant, they interpret 
any positive criticism offered to them as detrimental.

Some who share the morality that constitutes the subject of this book will say that they conform to the Qur'an, yet maintain their ignorant morality secr
etly and cunningly. However, all this is done within the "limit principle," meaning that the individual engages in all kinds of insincere acts that cannot be proven. He is also careful to do them in such a way that no one can claim that they are openly ag
a
inst the Qur'an. All his secret activities are kept within certain limits. In order to maintain these limits, the person may carry out both broad and fine tuning, as necessary. Broad tuning is determined from the outset; fine tuning is put into effect whe
n
 the faithful discover his insincerities. For example, when he says something irritable and is told that speaking in such a way does not accord with the morality described in the Qur'an, he can immediately adjust between speaking crossly and normal speaki
n
g. At every warning, he reduces the dose of irritability in what he says, but still does this with fragments of satan inside. At no stage does he submit to advice given on the basis of the Qur'an. But he can refine and narrow the borderline between submis
sion and not submitting. He uses concealed rudeness, concealed protest and concealed obstinacy in such limited doses that they cannot be proven.
\par In fact, entering into so much trouble and confusion to hide insincerities and protect oneself is meaningless. I
t is to live such a life and feed corrosive troubles that torment the conscience. Sincerity is much easier, much finer and much more down-to-earth. Never forget that, as we are told in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

by somebody's words or behavior, the great majority unhesitatingly react by slamming doors, behaving coldly towards other people, not talking to them, refusing to eat food prepared for them or not doing jobs that need to be done. People familiar with the 
morality of the Qur'an know that such behavior is not appropriate for believers and so do not resort to such protests.
\par Some who lack sincere faith have no hesitation in carrying out protest actions that do not conform to the morality of the Qur'an, but do n
ot do so openly, mostly with indifferent, silent, cold behavior. When people in such a spiritual state is asked a question, they cannot give a plain, normal answer. Sometimes they give a short, belittling answer and sometimes secretly protest by giving cu
r
t answers like "Yes," "No," or "I don't know." This is an attempt to seem to be replying. If asked, "Why didn't you answer?", they put the other person in the wrong by saying, "I did." Sometimes they play for time by giving very vague answers after a dela
y. When asked why they remained silent or answered late, they put forward which are obviously insincere excuses that cannot be proved as such\emdash 
for example, "I was thinking," or "I couldn't think what I wanted to say." In an environment where all others are e
njoying themselves, they cannot enjoy themselves as they would like and only content themselves with smiling and behaving wearily and coldly. But when asked why they are behaving like this and whether or not there's a problem, they give a false answer by 
s
aying, "Nothing is wrong." Sometimes they disguise their protest by offering excuses such as illness or sleeplessness. In this way, when they receive a complaint about their behavior, they claim that none of it is deliberate, but they are behaving that wa
y because they are ill.
\par Those who exhibit such ugly behavior should know that the only ones who suffer from this situation are themselves. Even when others have no clear proof, most of them realize that such a person is behaving insincerely. In accordance w
ith the morality of the Qur'an, a pious believer gives such a person a useful answer by inviting him to superior morality, and he himself lives in the peace of this superior morality. One who is determined to show secret immorality for the sake of protest
i
ng cannot enjoy himself, laugh or speak as he would really like to. Because he judges events or other people from a negative viewpoint, such people can find no pleasure. They interpret everything as a problem and live always in trouble and torment. The on
l
y solution is for a person to fear Allah and devote himself to the morality of the Qur'an. Only one who gives himself to Allah with a sincere heart and avoids everything that Allah will not approve of can find tranquility and happiness in this world and t
he Hereafter.}{\f0\insrsid2565081

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Our Lord explains the kind of repentance which will gain acceptance in His sight in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "Allah only accepts the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance an

d actions (and who can forgive bad actions except Allah?) and do not knowingly persist in what they were doing" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 (Surah Al 'Imran: 135).
\par Allah tells us that He will forgive mistakes made through ignorance or lack of knowledge, provided that people immediate
ly give them up when they notice them and do not persist in the same errors. Thus a believer who wants to achieve true sincerity towards Allah should think in line with these verses and ask Allah's forgiveness for all the insincerities he hides inside him
self.
\par However, the behavior for which Allah will call people to account on the Day of Judgment does not consist only of the insincerities they display openly. Allah also takes into account insincerities that people are consciously aware of, but try to hide 
from others. As we are reminded in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 "... Allah knows what you divulge and what you conceal" }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
(Surat an-Nur: 29), Allah knows what is going on inside a person even though others cannot prove any insincerity. Because of this, when evaluating himself
, a person should measure not only his externally visible behavioral defects which can be proved, but also his secret insincerities. He should give up all these and ask Allah's forgiveness.
\par He should know that otherwise\emdash if he does not accept warnings he is given, disdains those who give them and sets his face against them\emdash  he may fall into the situation of the people described in the Qur'an like this: }{

What makes these people adopt this sincerity is being in torment and, understanding Allah's power and might, seeking His help. Strikingly, at such a point, people are not forced to try for sincerity at all. At the moment they see the to
rment, they use their consciences and their wills to the maximum and make every sincere effort to achieve a morality that Allah will approve. This demonstrates that, even before they experience torment, people possess the power to be sincere. There is rea
l
ly no need for others to explain to them or try to prove their insincerities. They can take on characteristics that Allah will approve simply by referring to their consciences. If despite this, they still set their faces against those who warn them and in
vite them to sincerity, they should seriously fear the torment that Allah can bring down on them in the life of the world.
\par Allah can repay people for insincerity with torment at any unexpected moment. He can take away all a person's goods, property and resp
ect and leave him in helpless poverty. He can bring down unimaginable discomfort, unhappiness and inner affliction. While keeping the body alive, He can petrify the soul so that to the end of his life, the individual can take no pleasure from any blessing
 
or anything beautiful. Allah can make him live until his death unable to love or be loved or experience the pleasure of friendship and sincerity. In addition to these spiritual torments, Allah can give people relentless diseases, as He points out in this

 fully abandon insincerity cannot be rescued from the unhappy lives they lead or the secret sorrows they suffer. Even though they are warned, people who persist in their insincerity and fail to even approach the life of the true faith will also be unhappy
 
in the Hereafter. Never forget that a person is being tested in the life of the world. In the Hereafter, he will receive a reward to the extent that he struggles against his lower self and lives out the kind of morality and faith which Allah loves. Those 
who cleanse and purify their souls will be rewarded with Paradise; those who are wrapped in sin and evil, with Hell.
\par Those in the world who do not live in honesty and sincerity, who do not know humility and submission and who adopt unbelief and hypocrisy as
 their principles, will be repaid for this immorality in the Hereafter. Allah has purged Paradise of all ills and defects. People received into Paradise are those who have tried to purge their souls of all evil in the life of the world. Obviously, one who
 
wants to be received into Paradise needs to purge himself of all evil, because those who retain any of their wickedness, who do not live superior morality and do not know the beauty of love and being loved certainly cannot reach the state in which they ca
n
 share pleasure in these things in the Hereafter. Worldly life is a learning place for them, but whatever characteristics their souls have taken on in the world will also be their characteristics in the Hereafter. If they have gained none, the repayment f
or their worldly morality will be the continuation of the same troubles, torments and unhappiness in the Hereafter.
\par In consequence, every person should fear this danger waiting for him, prepare for it while there is still time, live his life in complete sin
cerity and make every effort to attain the morality approved by Allah. In the following pages, the thought-provoking repayment those who display insincere morality in the life of the world will receive in the Hereafter will be shortly described.

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Throughout this book, it has been explained that some people have a depressed, unhappy, withdrawn and tense spiritual state. The purpose in 
writing this book was not only to tell why people are unhappy, which insincerities will return to them as torment and what dangers await them in this world and the Hereafter, but first and foremost to show them how to rescue themselves from troubled spiri
tual states and to achieve sincerity. Everyone should know that to live a comfortable, peaceful and happy life in this world and the next is extremely easy\emdash and above all rational and correct.
\par For this, even if a person has some faith, he needs to sincerely 
intend to become "truly pious." In the Qur'an, Allah describes the characteristics of righteous believers. There is only one morality peculiar to the righteous. Allah has promised that those with the morality of the pious believer will find salvation both
 
in this world and the Hereafter. To achieve this, it is a necessary priority to remember that every event takes place with Allah's permission and under Allah's control. Knowing this very important fact and acting at every moment in its knowledge are most 
important methods by which a person can rescue himself from secret sorrows in worldly life. One who grasps this fact in the full sense will know that everything is a blessing for him, no matter what befalls him, and thus greets everything with gladness.

\par Truly religious people believe in destiny and know that it is out of the question for anybody to change his destiny. A person's fate is determined before he is even born. Allah explains this in the Qur'an:

In the face of this truth, a person living out his destiny needs to be cheerful about every detail of every event and see the goodness in it. These are the conditions for being a righteous believer. For a person who has 
and understands this knowledge, it is out of the question to feel sad, be over-emotional, cry, believe that he has suffered an injustice, fall into jealousy, take offense, become angry, react to events with protests, fly into rages and despair. A believer
 
is pleased with every moment of his life, can see every blessing created and lives in a spiritual state of feeling grateful for the comfort brought by living his life under Allah's control. Whether or not he understands His Divine wisdom, he feels pleased
 
with everything which comes from Allah. No event in the world can make such a person give way to sorrow, tension or worry or cause him fear. Because he knows that he cannot step outside his destiny and because his intentions are clean and pure, he always 
hopes for goodness and benefits from Allah and does not allow any negative thinking into his life.
\par Another of the most important conditions that rescues a person from the sorrows of the world is his full intention to be sincere. This concept, as well as sin
cerity itself, embraces honesty, avoidance of selfish interests, remaining true to Allah and preferring the morality of the Qur'an or the comfort of the faithful over one's own interests.
\par In addition, it is necessary for a person to keep his heart devoted 
to Allah at all times and not give way to the blandishments of his lower self. He should always keep his heart pure, never forgetting that Allah hears and sees him at every moment and, furthermore, is closer to Him than his own jugular vein. Allah reveals
 this truth to us in the Qur'an:

\par }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Understanding this is another of the basics for being a righteous believer. Such a person knows that he is under Allah's inspection at every moment. And because he is aiming to gain Allah's good will
, he strenuously avoids any of the behaviors which give rise to insincerity. For anyone who knows that Allah sees and hears him, it is impossible to speak in a way that deliberately discomforts others, to adopt insincere expressions, display selfish behav
ior or behave deceitfully by concealing one's true character\emdash 
because he has a sure faith that Allah is with him at all times. Because he knows that in the Hereafter he will definitely be called to account for any unconscionable behavior, he invariably displays a morality that will earn Allah's approval. 
\par He does not at any time stoop to secret acts and treacheries which he thinks cannot be proven, because he is aware that Allah possesses knowledge of all secrets. In the same way, he does not resort to self-d
eception by convincing himself that he is innocent. He knows Allah also sees such deceptions. He does not try to conceal from people any truth that Allah knows, because what is most important for him is Allah's approval.
\par As a result of all these factors, a
 pure, conscientious, honest and sincere person emerges. Such a person lives in the peace, security and internal cheerfulness of behaving as Allah approves. Just as a sincere individual lives a beautiful life in the world, he will also live in unparallele
d eternal happiness in the boundless beauty prepared for the faithful in Paradise.

Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which claims that life emerged by cha
nce from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of miraculous order in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that Allah created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out
 today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.
\par Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The fact that the theory of e
volution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfou
n
ded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the fact of crea
tion to account for the origin of life. 
\par We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, i

Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's}{

, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that Allah created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ances
tor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties
 on Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the di
mensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth.

The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate million
s of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell"
 originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, in
animate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitiv
e understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely a
c
cepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would origi
nate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of
 larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par Even when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 , the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin'
s book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneou
s generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."}{\f0\up4\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 1}{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
\par For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being
, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian

Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve this problem. The best known experiment was carried
 out by the American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial Earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) 
present in the structure of proteins.

 primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all
 of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.

\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consist
ing of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can
 be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute
 from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 Scientific American }{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 magazine:

It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in th

ortant point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: }{\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the 
standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generatio
n
. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended
 from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

ered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as a

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930s. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distort
ions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. Th
e theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientif
ic fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \s22\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid16267234 \i\f8\fs20\lang1024\langfe1024\cgrid\noproof\langnp1055\langfenp1033 {\f0\fs22\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly chan
ges in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framewo
rk of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\i0\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 9}{\f0\fs22\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It
 was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive
 
mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no 
such any imaginary process called "evolution" could have taken place.

However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle 
of the nineteenth century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All of the fossils, contrary to the evolutionists' expectations, show that life appeared on Earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. 
\par One famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist:

This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, this is very strong
 evidence that all living things are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor is that it was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist bio
logist Douglas Futuyma:

supposed to have existed. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic "categories" are listed:

Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, which is "upheld" with the help of various drawings of some "half ape, half human" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no sci

\par Zuckerman also made an interesting "spectrum of science" ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most "scientific"\emdash that is, depending on concrete data\emdash 
fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most "unscientific," are "extra-sensory perception"\emdash 
concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense\emdash and finally "human evolution." Zuckerman explains his reasoning:

Besides all the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconsciou
s atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, o
n
ly a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they really claim wi
thout pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in 
these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids and as many proteins\emdash a single one of which has a formation probability of 10}{
\f0\up4\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 -950}{\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 \emdash as they like. Let them ex
pose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for
 
billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell str
u
cture under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasa
nts, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and d
ivide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Alla
h's superior creation. 
\par The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming
 from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an im
age after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and tha
t no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the ey
e is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ev
e
r seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and
 
extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a 
T
V screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth
. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3
-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the
 television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of
 its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance
, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear
 transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation i
n the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest 
s
ounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be 
found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems fo
r sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highe
s
t-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that 
a
re the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is th
e way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

iousness belong? Of course it does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer, and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions. 
\par For this consciousness is the spirit created by Allah, which needs neither the eye to watch the images nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, it does not need the brain to think. 
\par Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty Allah, and fear an
d seek refuge in Him, for He squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeters in a three-dimensional, colored, shadowy, and luminous form.

A Materialist Faith
\par }\pard\plain \s20\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid16267234 \f8\fs22\lang1024\langfe1024\cgrid\noproof\langnp1055\langfenp1033 {\f0\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 
The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory o
f evolution is incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate 
f
orms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout histo
ry. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. The
se circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a 
material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-int
uitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.}{\i\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234 19}{\f0\fs22\insrsid16267234\charrsid16267234

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. Th
is dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and hu
m
an beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not t
o allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Creator is A
llah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideo

\par As explained above, thos

"
 Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically, and hidden the truth from them as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindnes
s than the totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of Prophet Ibrahim (as) worshipping idols they had made with their own hands, or the people of Prophet Musa (as) worshipping the Golden Calf.
\par In fact, Allah has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur'an. In many verses, He reveals that some peoples' minds will be closed and that they will be powerless to see the truth. Some of these verses are as follows:

\par The reason why they suffer from sorrow and feel unhappy even in the best of circumstances is because they live at a d
istance from Allah. Allah grants people happiness only through faith, and only in this way it is possible to take full pleasure in the beautiful things of life. So long as no sincere faith in accordance with the Qur'an exists, it is impossible to achieve 
true happiness by any means whatsoever.
\par This book highlights this important truth and calls on people to live out true and sincere faith. It explains that people really create with their own efforts the systems that prevent them from being happy and enjoyin
g life's blessings, and which plunge them into sorrow. It makes it clear that the only way to be protected against secret unhappiness is to believe in Allah with a sincere heart. It reminds the readers that so long as people do not achieve this sincerity 
towards Allah, they cannot experience real happiness by any means whatsoever\emdash and that the secret sorrows of this world may well turn }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid8796177
