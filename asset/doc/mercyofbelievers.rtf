lapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to aband
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of Qur'anic verses, and people are invited to learn\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ge and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nnot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This book and all the other works by Harun Yahya can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in that they will be
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and circulation of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the boo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ks of the author are extremely convincing, so, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In them, one will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explana\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tions based on dubious sources, styles unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, or hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart.

or, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad, the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to disprove each one of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intent
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 on of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All author' s works center around one goal: to convey the Qur' an' s message to people, encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues (such as the existence of Allah, His unity and the Hereafter), and to expose the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers worldwide. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrum\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ental in many people recovering their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any one who reads or stud
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, rend\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er an invaluable service. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doub
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hose who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will att

When you ask the people around you, "What is mercy?" or "How would you define mercy?", you would, most probably, receive a variety of responses and illustrations. Some say that a neighbour feeding stray dogs on the street is the most compassionate person 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hey have ever met. Others illustrate mercy with the interest and sincerity shown by a relative when they were sick. Others, on the other hand, regard a friend weeping for someone who has passed away as a "symbol of mercy". These definitions largely resemb
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e one another. However, none of them offers the definition of mercy in its real sense.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The source of true compassion is love of Allah. An individual's love of Allah leads him to feel an intimacy towards all these beings to whom Allah has given life. Someon\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e who loves Allah feels a direct link with and closeness to His creatures; he feels compassion and mercy towards them. Out of this profound love and attachment to Allah, Who created him and all other people, he behaves towards others in accordance with go
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d morals as set forth in the Qur'an. He fulfils Allah's orders regarding mercy. Real mercy is manifested when one fully complies with these commands of the Qur'an. That is because the Qur'an is the very source that describes, in the most accurate way, wha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  real compassion means and what a compassionate human being should do. There are numerous verses in the Qur'an which guide people to act with true mercy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  However, there is an important difference between the love felt for Allah and a feeling of compassion\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. This difference results from the fact that love for Allah is sincere and pure. Compassion embraces love mixed with feelings of mercy that is felt for someone because of his weaknesses. Whereas, there is no compassion in the love felt for Allah, because 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
llah is far from all kinds of incompleteness, weaknesses and defects. The feeling for one's own Creator can only be a powerful feeling of "love", which inspires enthusiasm, excitement, admiration and adoration. Hence, sincere and pure love can be felt onl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  for Allah, whereas compassion can be felt for beings created by Allah to be weak and powerless.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Qur'an provides a detailed description of true mercy, the attributes of a compassionate person, the kind of differences compassion brings forth in one's mo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par }{\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As expressed in the above verse, Allah commands His servants to "urge each other to compassion" in order to a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ttain His mercy, to enter the Garden and to prosper on the Last Day. Believers, who devote their lives to gaining Allah's approval, try to fulfil this order of Allah impeccably. Their sincere faith in Allah underlies this very understanding of mercy. They
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 are aware that nothing occurs unless by the Will of Allah\~
and realise their need to have all His blessings bestowed upon them. Accordingly, believers are humble, which is a consequence of such awareness. These very attributes constitute the basis of their\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mercy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
One who is not humble in the real sense, cannot show real mercy. That is because he thinks about himself alone, loves himself and gives importance solely to his own wishes and interests. That is why he never considers the needs of others. He deems 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 other people worthless and unimportant. Consequently, he fails to have feelings of compassion and affection.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another reason why believers are committed to showing compassion is their earnest desire to embody the morality deemed good by Allah. As explained \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in numerous verses, Allah is "the Most Merciful of the merciful". For that reason, believers strive to experience compassion to the best of their ability.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As Allah revealed in the Qur'an, }{\b\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid4420340 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "If it had not been for the favour of Allah upon you and His mercy, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
(you would have suffered many difficult situations)." (Surat an-Nur: 20)}{\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 The above verse shows the extent to which believers are in need of the compassion and mercy of Allah. Since they themselves seek to obtain Allah's Mercy, they try to be as compassiona\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 te as possible towards other believers. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is true of all other issues, the unique guide that sheds light on the kind of mercy they have to show is the Qur'an. Thus, believers only show mercy and compassion in situations deemed to be proper by Allah and t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 owards people specified by Allah. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Mercy as described in the Qur'an emerges as being quite distinct from other kinds of mercy. But the majority of those who are distant from religion possess a rather flawed understanding of the subject. Faced with untoward
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 happenings, they are seized by an ill-defined feeling of mercy and act accordingly. This indeed shows a crude understanding of how they should respond, because they act without knowing who is right or wrong, without making a just and rational assessment 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd, more importantly, without considering the commands of the Qur'an. Often, they tend to behave in a manner likely to do harm both to themselves and to other people; their attempts to remedy matters are abortive because they take ill-considered decisions
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Their understanding of compassion thus presents a structure uninspired by the values of the Qur'an.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In relation to this subject, we need to dwell on another important point. People sometimes harbour an understanding of mercy which may be wrong according t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o the Qur'an. Since this kind of mercy does harm to people rather than good, it may be considered as "evil compassion". In societies which are indifferent to religion, people allow others to engage in any act without considering its baneful result in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ereafter. For instance, they allow them to behave immorally and turn a blind eye when they engage in an act forbidden by Allah, or even encourage them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The criteria believers adopt for themselves in this matter is that the mercy shown to others must defin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
itely make a positive impact in terms of others' eternal life in the hereafter. In some cases, the love and mercy they feel for believers may entail their interfering or criticising them on some issues which may be hard on their lower selves }{

n witnessing a wicked deed, they may criticise the perpetrator and make strong pleas to deter him from such a deed. This is indeed true compassion. That is because, at the risk of causing offence to the other party, they put a stop to a conduct at varianc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  with Qur'anic teaching and thus prevent that person from engaging in an act that would incur eternal torment in hell\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
a point of no return. For that reason, believers encourage others to display the morality with which Allah will be pleased most, and whic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 will prepare them for a life in paradise. In so doing, they display the most elevated form of mercy. One needs to keep in mind that the real cruelty is not to consider the eternal life and to deliberately ignore mistakes that would incur punishment.

In this respect, believers follow the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, as their role model, who, in the words of the Qur'an, was "truly vast in character". (Surat al-Qalam: 4)

Whether well-off or poor, Allah commands believers to support women in a manner commensurate with their own means. In societies which do not live by the values of religion, generously supporting an ex-wife, from whom one can no longer derive any benefits,

In this section, we shall deal with how mercy permeates believers' lives, the elevated values arising from a correct understanding of mercy and how believers live by this morality. No doubt the attributes that reflect the believer's understandi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng of mercy are legion; yet, in this section, we have to limit ourselves to the most significant ones. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this juncture, there is an important point to remember: believers display moral perfection as described in the Qur'an only because Allah commands so \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and because they fear Allah. "Mercy" is, therefore, an extremely important and fundamental value that enables them to sincerely and properly live by Qur'anic morality and to maintain their commitment to it under all circumstances. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For instance, because it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is a command of Allah and because a believer has a deep fear of Allah's punishment, a believer does not even think of cheating in measurement, weight or calculation, thereby distressing other believers or placing them in difficulties. This aside, the fee

 Allah Who can judge the individual concerned. Thus, judging a person or not forgiving him is an attitude which a believer is not responsible for. The rewards one receives in return for sincere repentance and regret are at the will of Allah. Indeed, in nu

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 knows that true compassion entails not only forgiveness but also exhortations to be sincere and honest and to go in fear of Allah, all of which expresses his compassion in a more appropriate way.

As is evident from the above verses, Allah promises believers that they will attain goodness when they repel evil with good. He further points out that even in situations of enmity, the relationship between foes turns into \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a warm friendship. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This is also what believers' understanding of mercy entails. When believers witness an attitude that does not please Allah, they primarily approach the offenders humbly and with tolerance, without falling a prey to pride. That is becaus
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e they know that arrogance would have an adverse effect on their lives in the hereafter. Unlike those who do not observe Qur'anic morality, they do not hold a flawed rationale and say, "He is the one who has done wrong; he should act humbly", or "Let him 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o whatever he wishes". They recognise that Allah loves those who display the best attitude and showing a good attitude even when one is subjected to wickedness is acting in compliance with the Qur'an. This being the case, they know that acting humbly is n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t a loss but a great gain in the sight of Allah. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Believers encounter various different people throughout their lives. Yet, they never deviate from their moral code because of others' attitudes. Some people may speak derisively and be offensive in their wo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rds. They may show anger, enmity or do harm. However, a believer always perseveres in modesty, graciousness and compassion; he never responds to evil words in a similar vein. He does not mock people who mock him or display anger to someone who is angry wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h him. He remains calm when subjected to ignoble treatment. He even assumes a compassionate and tolerant attitude towards a person who has done him harm. Ultimately, in the face of the sublime disposition of the believer, the wrongdoer feels ashamed of hi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  behaviour and yearns to have such a noble character. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No doubt, while displaying all these attitudes, believers remain rational; they never let others do any harm or injustice to themselves or to other believers. Meanwhile, with the good attitude they sho
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w, they display the beauty of the values of the Qur'an, which draws people nearer to the morality that pleases Allah. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We need always to remember that the evil attitude shown by other people is not an excuse for us to deviate from our own high moral standa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The only way that ensures a peaceful and happy life for a community is the exercise of mercy as defined by the Qur'an. Failing to incorporate this model in daily life makes unrest, disorder and injustice take root in society. That is simply because, where
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mercy is absent, cruelty must exist. In a society harassed by cruelty, its members suffer both physical and spiritual harm. Indeed, the news bulletins we listen to every day make this point most obvious; they are full of the cruelty inflicted on people; p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ople who starve, mothers who beg on the streets to feed their children, those who are oppressed, attacked or beaten, those who live in abject poverty in tents, people who commit suicide or fight for a loaf of bread\'85\loch\f0 
 The main reason for all this misery is \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he cruelty and mercilessness brought about by disbelief. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Other than the concept of mercy as revealed by the Qur'an, which stems from the fear and love of Allah, there is no reason that would prevent an individual from committing wicked deeds. In a society\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 where people do not feel true mercy, there is nothing to prevent them from abusing women and children, murdering people for theft, leaving orphans on the streets and committing many similar misdeeds. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In a society devoid of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the Qur'anic understanding of mercy, the well-off do nothing to ensure the well-being of the poor, the rights of those who are unjustly treated remain undefended, and no shelter is provided for those who sleep out on streets. Unless there is something to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e gained, no one troubles to help another. While there are people out on the streets starving to death, the affluent throw huge amounts of food\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
enough to feed hundreds of people\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 into the garbage. Similarly, people stoop to such venality as pursuing vested\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 interests, perpetrating fraud or violating others' rights.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Again, the members of such a society do not take any serious action again of fraud, injustice and falsehood, but simply keep their mouths shut. They never aspire to solve the problems of others and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 even consider this a vain endeavour. Therefore, a system emerges in which no one feels responsible for another, no one takes any risks to protect others and no one stands up for others' rights. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The cruel and merciless oppress the weak as they please. In \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an environment in which people do not live by the Qur'anic mercy and good values instilled by religion, unrest, trouble and cruelty become all-pervasive. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, it should be borne in mind that one who is merciless primarily causes harm to himself. One w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ho ignores the right guidance of his conscience and indulges in cruelty can never be at peace with himself. That is because, deep inside, he does suffer the pangs of conscience. Every once in a while, his conscience gives him pain; he stumbles upon a pers
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n in need and recalls that he does not help the poor although he could if he wanted to. Similarly, every time he acts selfishly, his conscience bothers him. The only way to ease his conscience is to follow its dictates. That is because, conscience is the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ower that leads one to Allah's approval and the Qur'an. That is because, by nature, man attains happiness only when he follows the voice of his conscience. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No matter how the individual strives to forget or suppress his mercilessness or avoids acknowledgin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
g the injustice and unfairness around him, his conscience never allows him to forget his cruel attitudes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In a society in which Islamic morality is adopted, overall peace and security prevail. People feel assured that they will definitely receive help whe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n they need support. Those having adequate means never leave the poor and the homeless in despair. Children are raised in healthy environments where they are offered due care and love. The strong never oppress the weak. Nobody violates others' rights. Mea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s are allocated fairly, thereby offering everyone favourable conditions in which to live. The number of cruel people diminish and cruelty disappears. Everyone is entitled to have access to medical care, and a clean and comfortable environment, no matter w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ether they are rich or poor. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hence, the only way to be saved from the chaos and the cruelty which is caused by irreligion is to live by standards of mercy described in the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 More\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
over, turning away from cruelty to mercy is just a matter of reforming one's intentions. This will bring the individual a blissful life both in this world and beyond. Indeed, this change will make him recognise the perfection of the values of the Qur'an.

Although a doctrine going back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the 19th century. The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Dar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 win titled }{\i\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and they diversified over time through small changes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the Theory," the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gs expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prov
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even in the period when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid466135\charrsid5590946 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerston\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how could these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumul
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ting from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Ranganathan explains this as follows:

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the most important proponents of the theory of evolution in the twentieth century, contends in his book }{

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of "how we see". Light rays coming from an object\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the br
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct imag
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
00 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in you
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; mor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
over, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just hap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 pened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
vident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the soun
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be see
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that a complete silence is prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity system
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Thi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
k of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 his is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a far greater fact lies beyond all this.
