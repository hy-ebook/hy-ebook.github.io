The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 9\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
80s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cove\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r of the author's books has a symbolic meaning linked to the their contents. This seal represents the Qur'an, the last Book and the last word of God, and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author ma
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to people, thus encouraging them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Gre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
atly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ooks a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these bo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ks and give a serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this will be only a sentimental insistence since these books h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ve refuted these ideologies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f the Qur'an. The author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, no material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who enc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has attained are manifest in the reader's conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point needs to be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals the majority \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exagg\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

oday is the day of a major milestone in history. The materialist philosophy, once imposed on the mass of humanity under the guise of science, is ironically being defeated today by science itself. Materialism, the philosophy whi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ch holds that everything is composed of matter and which denies the existence of God, is actually the contemporary version of paganism. Ancient pagans used to worship non-living beings like wooden or stone totem poles and considered them divine beings. Ma
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erialist philosophy, on the other hand, bases its claim on the belief that man and all other beings are created out of atoms and molecules. According to this superstitious view, non-living atoms somehow organised themselves and over time acquired life and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 consciousness, finally bringing man into being. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This superstitious belief based on materialism is called }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "evolution."}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 The belief in evolution, first introduced in the pagan cultures of the ancient Sumerians and then the ancient Greeks, was in a way revive\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d in the 19th century by a group of materialist scientists and brought on to the world agenda. Charles Darwin is the best known of these scientists. The theory of evolution he advanced wasted the time of the world of science for 150 years, and despite its
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 flawed nature having been widely acknowledged, it has been sustained until quite recently for purely ideological reasons. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, as mentioned earlier, today, materialism is collapsing with a resounding crash. It is often stated that there were three imp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ortant materialist theorists who steered the 19th century: }{
\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Freud, Marx and Darwin. }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The theories of the first two were examined, tested, and, proving invalid, subsequently rejected in the 20th century. Nowadays, the theory of Darwin is also collapsing. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Som\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e important developments in June 2000 accelerated this great downfall of materialism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, scientists carrying out experiments to break the speed of light made a discovery which turned all scientific premises upside down. In an experiment in which the s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
peed of light was broken, the scientists observed with astonishment that }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the effect of the experiment occurred before its cause}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . This meant the defeat of the claim of }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "causality" }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that was put forward on the basis of materialist views in the 19th century. I\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t was reported in many scientific publications that "}{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this experiment proved that effect without cause is possible and that the end of an event can happen before its beginning."}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Indeed, the occurrence of the effect of an action before the action that seems \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to be its cause, is scientific evidence that all events are created individually. This totally demolishes the materialist dogma. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A few weeks later, it was revealed that }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Archaeopteryx, a fossil bird presented as "the most important fossil evidence" by Darw\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
inists for more than a century, was actually not evidence for, but a blow to the theory. }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
When another fossil, some 75 million years older than this fossil which was allegedly the "primitive ancestor of birds," and no different from modern birds, was discov\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ered, evolutionists were shocked. M}{
\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 any journals which used to present Archaeopteryx as the "primitive ancestor of birds"}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  were obliged to report that }{
\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "The Ancestor of Birds Proved to be a Bird." }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Finally, }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the Human Genome Project}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , an attempt to draft a roug

the details of the "genetic information," which highlighted how superior God's creation of living beings is, have been revealed to mankind. }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Today, everyone who considers the results of this project and finds out\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that a single human cell contains enough information to be stored in thousands of encyclopaedia pages, grasps what a great miracle of creation this is. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Nevertheless, evolutionists try to misinterpret this recent development, which, in truth, works agains\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t them, and present it as evidence for "evolution." Unable to explain even how the DNA chain of a tiny bacterium originated, evolutionists try to deliver messages such as "human genes resemble animal genes." Such messages are inaccurate and have no scient
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fic value. They are designed to mislead society. Meanwhile, some press institutions, both because of their ignorance on the subject and their prejudiced approach, suppose that the Human Genome Project provides "evidence of evolution" and try to present it
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 that way.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order for that first cell, the fertilized egg, to turn into a human being, it needs to multiply, and in the knowledge of that, it begins to divide, with a remarkable consciousness. That consciousness reveals itself in t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he next phase. As the cells divide, they begin to grow different and go to those parts of the body where they are needed. Instead of a mass of flesh composed of exactly the same cells, some of them turn into eye cells and go where they are needed, others

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eed, thus beginning to create different organs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The coordination of this differentiation and structuring is made possible by the DNA molecule. We must not lose sight of the fact that DNA is neither a biochemist working in laboratories full of the very late

an body multiply by dividing. Yet different genes in different cells are activated at different times, and that allows cells to differentiate. To put it another way, every cell that divides and multiplies after the first cell contains a complete set of ge
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
etic information. In other words, every single cell possesses the ability to produce heart muscle, skin, red blood cells or any other tissue in the body. Even though each cell contains a complete genetic description of the whole body, only some genes are 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ctive at different times in different organs. For instance, every cell contains the codes for the development and functioning of the kidneys, yet only the relevant genes are active in that organ, at certain times in the development phase. Similarly, certa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n enzymes, glucose-6-phospate for instance, are found mainly in the liver. Although all the cells of all other organs also possess the description of this protein, they never produce it. Eye cells never do; for example, they just make what is necessary fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t this flawless division of labor? Who orders the cells to specialise in different areas after they have divided and multiplied? Moreover, how do all the cells come by the consciousness to obey, and whom do they listen to while working with such flawless 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iscipline and organization? It is quite clear that none of these are coincidental systems, formed as the result of yet other coincidences. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This flawlessness does not end with the fact that cells appear in the right place and at the right time, and bring t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this case, you must admit that any cell in your stomach or\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 ear is much more learned than you, and since it makes use of this information in the most correct and perfect way, it is much wiser than you.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But what is the source of this wisdom? How is it that every single one of the 100 trillion cells in the human bod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y possesses such unbelievable intelligence, information and ability? These are, after all, piles of atoms, and they are unconscious. Take the atoms of all the elements, combine them in different forms and numbers, obtain different molecules, still you can
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 never obtain wisdom. Whether these molecules are big or small, simple or complex does not matter. You can never obtain a mind that will consciously organise any process and accomplish it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then how can it be that DNA, which is composed of the arrangement of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a certain number of unwise and unconscious atoms in certain sequences, and enzymes, working in a harmonious way, is able to organise countless complicated and diverse operations in the cell in a perfect and complete manner? The answer to this is very sim
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
le; wisdom is not in these molecules or in the cell that contains them, but in the self who has brought these molecules into being, programming them to function as they do. Shortly put, wisdom is present not in the work done, but in the creator of that wo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 k. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Even the most developed computer is the product of a wisdom and intellect that have written and installed the programs to operate it, and then used it. Likewise, the cell, DNA and the RNAs in it, and the human being made up of these cells are nothing b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ut the works of the One who created them as well as what they do. No matter how perfect, complete and striking the work is, the wisdom always lies with the owner of the work. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you saw one meaningful sentence in your notebook on the table, you would be c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
urious to know who wrote it. You would never think that the notebook and the pen or the ink came together with the effect of the wind and wrote this sentence. In DNA, we are talking about billions of pieces of information each of which is crucial for a hu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 an being. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
So, why don't we ask the same question about the cell? If the information in the notebook or the computer was written by someone, then who "wrote" DNA, which has a far superior and more advanced technology, is designed in the most perfect manner
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, created, and placed in the tiny cell, which, by itself, is another miracle? Besides, to date it has not lost any of the properties which it has had for thousands of years. What can be more important for you than to question by whom and why these cells, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hat function non-stop so that you may read these lines, see, breathe, think, in brief, exist and continue to exist, have been brought into being?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Is not the answer to this question that which, in life, you must wonder about most? One sees great design, pla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nning and order, from the sun in the sky to the DNA in one's body. To think that any of these things could be the work of chance is an unacceptable claim, one that is impossible to take seriously.

rtant discoveries of molecular biology was that some genes are more influential than others. The reason for this is that genes are set out in a very complicated order. In the fundamental genetic hierarchy there are genes charged with carrying out function
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that are repeated: making haemoglobin, hair growth, or the production of digestive enzymes for instance. There are "ordering" genes placed over these worker molecules. These make the worker molecules work, and also stop them from doing so. For example, t

drome, is quite widespread. It is caused by the presence of an extra chromosome in the 21st chromosome pair in every cell. Another example is Huntington's Disease. The sufferer is quite healthy up to 35, but then uncontrollable muscular spasms appear in t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e arms, legs and face. Since this fatal and incurable disease also affects the brain, the sufferer's memory and powers of thought grow progressively weaker. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All these genetic diseases reveal one important fact: the genetic code is so sensitive and balance\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d, and so minutely calculated, that the smallest change can lead to very serious consequences. One letter too many or too few can lead to fatal sicknesses, or lifelong crippling effects. For this reason, it is definitely impossible to think that such a se

ly by dividing. While the human body is initially composed of a single cell, this cell divides and reproduces itself many times over in a ratio of 2-4-8-16-32...
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What happens to DNA at the end of this dividing process?\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 There is only one DNA chain in the cell. However, it is evident that the newly formed cell will also require a DNA. In order to fill this gap, DNA completes an interesting series of operations, every phase of which is a different miracle. Finally, soon b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fore the cell divides, it makes a copy of itself and transfers this to the new cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Observations of cell division show that the cell has to reach a specific size before dividing. The moment it exceeds this particular size, the division process automatica\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lly starts. While the shape of the cell begins to get smoother so as to accommodate the division process, DNA starts to replicate itself as mentioned earlier.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This means that the cell "decides" to divide as a whole and the different parts of the cell start\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to act in accordance with this decision. It is evident that the cell is devoid of the consciousness to accomplish such a collective action. The division process starts with a secret order and the entire cell, including DNA, acts on this order. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 First, DNA\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 divides into two to replicate itself. This event takes place in a very interesting manner. The DNA molecule which resembles a spiral ladder divides into two like a zip from the middle of the rungs of the ladder. From now on, DNA divides into two portions
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 The missing halves (replicates) of both of the two portions are completed with the materials present in the milieu. In this way, two new DNA molecules are produced. In every phase of the operation, expert proteins called "enzymes" that function like adva
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ced robots take part. Though it seems simple at first sight, the intermediary processes taking place throughout this operation are so many and so complicated that to describe the whole event in detail would take pages.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One thing must not be forgotten here.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 The enzymes that form as a result of atoms coming together examine one half of the DNA spiral, identify those parts that are missing, take the missing parts from the appropriate places and add them where needed. In this way, the copying of DNA comes abou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. The way that tiny unconscious, unreasoning structures can flawlessly carry out such complex processes, that require consciousness, knowledge and reason is not to be glossed over by just reading about them. There are important truths revealed here that n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed to be considered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The new DNA molecules that emerge during replication are checked repeatedly by inspector enzymes. If any mistake is made-which can be quite vital, it is immediately identified and corrected. The erroneous code is removed and replaced b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y the correct one. Although all these processes take place at such a dazzling speed-3,000 base pairs are produced in a minute,-all these pairs are checked repeatedly by the enzymes in charge and the necessary amendments are made.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The following facts, which\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 are particularly revealing will give a better understanding of the great speed at which DNA multiplies. The division of one cell lasts between 20 and 80 minutes, and the information on DNA needs to be copied and multiplied within that time scale. In othe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 words, the 3 billion pieces of information in DNA can be copied in between 20 and 80 minutes with no faults or omissions. That is as miraculous as the perfect reproduction in such a short space of time as all the information in a library, or 1,000 books,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 or a million pages. And note carefully, it is not technological equipment or advanced photocopiers that do this, but enzymes formed by collections of atoms. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the newly produced DNA molecule, more mistakes can be made than normal as a result of external \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
factors. In this case, the ribosomes in the cell start to produce DNA repair enzymes as per the order given by DNA. Thus, as DNA protects itself, it also guarantees the preservation of the generation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The cells are born, they reproduce and die just like hu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
man beings. Yet the life spans of cells are much shorter than the life of the human they constitute. For instance, the majority of the cells that used to make up your body six months ago do not exist today. However, you are now able to survive because the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 have divided on time to leave their places to the new ones. For this reason, highly complex operations like multiplication of the cells and replication of DNA are vital processes which cannot tolerate even a minor mistake when it comes to man's survival.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
However, the multiplication process runs so smoothly that the rate of error is only one in 3 billion base pairs. And this one error is eliminated by the higher control mechanisms in the body without causing any problems.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most interesting point is that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
these enzymes which help in the production of DNA and control its composition are actually proteins produced according to the information coded in DNA and under the command and control of DNA. There is such an intertwined, perfect system at work that it i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 by no means possible for such a system to have attained this state by gradual coincidences. Just as DNA has to exist for the enzyme to exist, so the enzyme has to exist for DNA to exist, and for both to exist, on the other hand, the cell has to exist com
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 letely, down to its membrane and all the other complex organelles it contains.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution asserting that living beings evolved "step by step" as a result of "beneficial coincidences" is explicitly refuted by the above mentioned DNA-enzyme para\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dox. This is because both DNA and the enzyme have to exist at the same time. And this shows the existence of a conscious creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All through the day, quite without your being aware of it, numerous operations and controls are carried out, and many measure\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists can in no way offer any expl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
anation on the subject of how DNA originated, and there is yet another point where they reach an impasse. How is it that fish, reptiles, insects, birds or human beings came to have different DNA, different genetic information?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists answer that que\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
stion by saying that the body of information in DNA developed and diversified over time by means of coincidences. The coincidences they refer to are "mutations." Mutations are changes which take place in DNA as a result of radiation or chemical action. So
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
etimes radioactive radiation happens to fall on a DNA chain and destroys or displaces several base pairs therein. According to evolutionists, living things have reached their present perfect state as a result of the diversification of a single DNA due to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hese mutations (i.e., accidents). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To show that this claim is unreasonable, let us again compare DNA to a book. We have already mentioned that DNA is made up of letters lined up sideways just as in a book. Mutations are like the letter errors that occur du
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ring the type-setting of this book. If you like, we can do an experiment on this subject. Let us ask for a thick book about the history of the world to be type-set. During the type-setting, let us intervene several times and tell the type-setter to press 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ne of the keys blindfolded and at random. Then let us give this text containing letter errors to someone else and have him do the same thing over again. Using this method, let us have the book type-set from the beginning to the end several times, thus hav
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng a few more letter errors added to it at random each time...
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Could this history book ever develop by this method? For instance, would an additional chapter emerge, named, "The History of Ancient China," when it had previously not been present?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To be sure\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, the letter errors we have added to the book would not develop it, but rather ruin it and distort its meaning. The more we increase the number of faulty copying processes, the more spoiled our book will be. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet the cla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
im of the theory of evolution is that "letter errors help develop a book." According to evolution, mutations (errors) occurring in DNA have led to beneficial results by accumulating and thus furnishing living beings with perfect organs such as eyes, ears,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 wings, hands and consciousness-related qualities such as thinking, learning, and reasoning.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Unquestionably, this claim is even more unreasonable than the above example of the addition of the chapter called "The History of Ancient China" to a book on world \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
history as a result of the accumulation of letter errors. (Moreover there is no mechanism in nature that causes regular mutations as in the example of the type-setter making regular mistakes. The mutations in nature take place much more rarely than the le
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ter errors that would occur during the type-setting of a book.)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Every "explanation" put forward by the theory of evolution on the origin of life is unreasonable and unscientific. One outspoken authority on this issue is the famous French zoologist Pierre G\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
\hich\f0 rass\'e9\loch\f0 \hich\f0 , the former president of the French Academy of Sciences. Grass\'e9\loch\f0 
 is also an evolutionist, but he states clearly that Darwinist theory is unable to explain life and makes his point about the logic of "coincidence," which is the backbone of Darwinism:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he opportune appearance of mutations permitting animals and plants to meet their needs seems hard to believe. Yet the Darwinian theory is even more demanding: A single plant, a single animal would require thousands and thousands of lucky, appropriate even
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 s. Thus, miracles would become the rule: events with an infinitesimal probability could not fail to occur\'85\loch\f0 
 There is no law against day-dreaming, but science must not indulge in it.6 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Indeed, the theory of evolution, which claims that lifeless matter came t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ogether by itself and formed living beings with such glorious systems as DNA, is a scenario totally contrary to science and reason. All this leads us to an evident conclusion. Since life has a plan (DNA) and all living beings are fashioned according to th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s plan, it is evident that there is a superior Creator who devised this plan. This simply means that all living beings are created by God, the All-Powerful, All-Wise. God states this fact in the Qur'an in this way: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He is God \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  the Creator, the Maker, the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Giver of Form. To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names. Everything in the heavens and earth glorifies Him. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. (Qur'an, 59:24)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, what people have achieved by means of technology can at best be described as "an approach to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the understanding of a tiny fragment of God's knowledge, as manifested in human DNA."

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The question of how such an extraordinarily designed molecule as DNA originated is one of the thousands of impasses evolutionists\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 reach. Seeking to explain life by means of "coincidence," the theory of evolution can never explain the source of the extraordinary information so perfectly and meticulously encoded in DNA. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, the question is not only that of how the DNA chain ori\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ginated. That is because, as we have already seen, although the DNA chain exists with its extraordinary information capacity, it serves no purpose on its own. In order to refer to life, it is essential that the enzymes that read this DNA chain, copy them 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd produce proteins, should also exist.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Simply put, in order to talk of life, both the data bank we call DNA, and the machines to carry out production by reading the data in the bank have to co-exist. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To our surprise, enzymes, which read DNA and carry out\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 production accordingly, are themselves produced according to the codes in DNA. This means that there is a factory in the cell that both makes many different types of products, and also manufactures the robots and machines that carry out this production. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he question of how this system, which would be of no use with a minor defect in any of its mechanisms originated, is by itself enough to demolish the theory of evolution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionist Douglas R. Hofstadter of Indiana University, states his despair in the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 face of this question: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "How did the Genetic Code, along with the mechanisms for its translation (ribosomes and RNA molecules), originate?" For the moment, we will have to content ourselves with a sense of wonder and awe, rather than with an answer.7

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Anoth\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er evolutionist authority, world renowned molecular biologist Leslie Orgel, is more outspoken on the subject: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, ONE MIGHT HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT LIFE COULD NEVER, IN FACT, HAVE ORIGINATED BY CHEMICAL MEANS.8
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Saying "life could never have originated by chemical means" is th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e equivalent of saying that "life could never have originated by itself." Recognition of the truth of this statement results in the realization that life is created in a conscious way. For ideological reasons, evolutionists, however, do not accept this fa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t, clear evidence of which is before their eyes. To avoid accepting the existence of God, they believe in nonsensical scenarios, despite their evident impossibility.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another evolutionist, Caryl P. Haskins, states how the DNA code could not have emerged by \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 chance, and that this fact is strong evidence for creation: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But the most sweeping evolutionary questions at the level of biochemical genetics are still unanswered. How the genetic code first appeared and then evolved and, earlier even than that, how life \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
itself originated on earth remain for the future to resolve.... Did the code and the means of translating it appear simultaneously in evolution? It seems almost incredible that any such coincidence could have occurred, given the extraordinary complexities
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This was a big blow to the theory of molecular evolution. Evolutionists then had to face the fact that the "primitive atmosphere experiments" by S\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hether living or not, wears out, deteriorates, decays, disintegrates, and is destroyed. This is the absolute end that all beings will face one way or another, and according to the law, the process cannot be avoided. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is something that all of us have o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
bserved. For example if you take a car to a desert and leave it there, you would hardly expect to find it in a better condition when you came back years later. On the contrary, you would see that its tyres had gone flat, its windows had been broken, its c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 assis had rusted, and its engine had stopped working. The same inevitable process holds true for living things.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The second law of thermodynamics is the means by which this natural process is defined, with physical equations and calculations. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This famous l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aw of physics is also known as "the law of entropy." In physics, entropy is the measure of the disorder of a system. A system's entropy increases as it moves towards from an ordered, organised, and planned state towards a more disordered, dispersed, and u
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
planned one. The more disorder there is in a system, the higher its entropy is. The law of entropy holds that the entire universe is unavoidably proceeding towards a more disordered, unplanned, and disorganised state. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The truth of the second law of thermo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dynamics, or the entropy law, has been experimentally and theoretically established. All foremost scientists agree that the law of entropy will remain the principle paradigm for the foreseeable future. Albert Einstein, the greatest scientist of our age, d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 scribed it as the "premier law of all science." Sir Arthur Eddington also referred to it as the "supreme metaphysical law of the entire universe."1
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionary theory ignores this fundamental law of physics. The mechanism offered by evolution totally cont\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
radicts the second law. The theory of evolution says that disordered, dispersed, and lifeless atoms and molecules spontaneously came together over time, in a particular order, to form extremely complex molecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, whereupon m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
llions of different living species with even more complex structures gradually emerged. According to the theory of evolution, this supposed process-which yields a more planned, more ordered, more complex and more organised structure at each stage-was form
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d all by itself under natural conditions. The law of entropy makes it clear that this so-called natural process utterly contradicts the laws of physics.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionist scientists are also aware of this fact. J.H. Rush states: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the complex course of its ev\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
olution, life exhibits a remarkable contrast to the tendency expressed in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Where the Second Law expresses an irreversible progression toward increased entropy and disorder, life evolves continually higher levels of order.2

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The evolutionist author Roger Lewin expresses the thermodynamic impasse of evolution in an article in Science: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One problem biologists have faced is the apparent contradiction by evolution of the second law of thermodynamics. Systems should decay through t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ime, giving less, not more, order.3
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another defender of the theory of evolution, George Stravropoulos, states the thermodynamic impossibility of the spontaneous formation of life and the impossibility of explaining the existence of complex living mechanism
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s by natural laws in the well-known evolutionist journal American Scientist: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet, under ordinary conditions, no complex organic molecule can ever form spontaneously, but will rather disintegrate, in agreement with the second law. Indeed, the more complex \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it is, the more unstable it will be, and the more assured, sooner or later, its disintegration. Photosynthesis and all life processes, and even life itself, cannot yet be understood in terms of thermodynamics or any other exact science, despite the use of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 confused or deliberately confusing language.4
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we have seen, the second law of thermodynamics constitutes an insurmountable obstacle for the scenario of evolution, in terms of both science and logic. Unable to offer any scientific and consistent explanat
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion to overcome this obstacle, evolutionists can only do so in their imagination. For instance, the well-known evolutionist Jeremy Rifkin notes his belief that evolution overwhelms this law of physics with a "magical power:"

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Entropy Law says that evolu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tion dissipates the overall available energy for life on this planet. Our concept of evolution is the exact opposite. We believe that evolution somehow magically creates greater overall value and order on earth.5 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 se words well indicate that evolution is a dogmatic belief rather than a scientific thesis.

\par }{\b\f0\fs28\insrsid538165\charrsid6650035 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Myth of the "Open System"
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Confronted by all these truths, evolutionists have had to take refuge in a mangling of the second law of thermodynamics, saying that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it holds true only for "closed systems," and that "open systems" are beyond the scope of this law.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An "open system" is a thermodynamic system in which energy and matter flow in and out. Evolutionists hold that the world is an open system: that it is consta\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ntly exposed to an energy flow from the sun, that the law of entropy does not apply to the world as a whole, and that ordered, complex living beings can be generated from disordered, simple, and inanimate structures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, there is an obvious distortio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n here. The fact that a system has an energy inflow is not enough to make that system ordered. Specific mechanisms are needed to make the energy functional. For instance, a car needs an engine, a transmission system, and related control mechanisms to conv
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rt the energy in petrol to work. Without such an energy conversion system, the car will not be able to use the energy in petrol.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The same thing applies in the case of life as well. It is true that life derives its energy from the sun. However, solar energy\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 can only be converted into chemical energy by the incredibly complex energy conversion systems in living things (such as photosynthesis in plants and the digestive systems of humans and animals). No living thing can live without such energy conversion sy
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tems. Without an energy conversion system, the sun is nothing but a source of destructive energy that burns, parches, or melts. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As can be seen, a thermodynamic system without an energy conversion mechanism of some sort is not advantageous for evolution, b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e it open or closed. No one asserts that such complex and conscious mechanisms could have existed in nature under the conditions of the primeval earth. Indeed, the real problem confronting evolutionists is the question of how complex energy-converting mec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 anisms, such as photosynthesis in plants, which cannot be duplicated even with modern technology, could have come into being on their own. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The influx of solar energy into the world would be unable to bring about order on its own. Moreover, no matter how h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
igh the temperature may become, amino acids resist forming bonds in ordered sequences. Energy by itself is incapable of making amino acids form the much more complex molecules of proteins, or of making proteins form the much more complex and organised str
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ctures of cell organelles. The real and essential source of this organisation at all levels is conscious design: in a word, creation.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Quite aware that the second law of thermodynamics renders evolution impossible, some evolutio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nist scientists have made speculative attempts to square the circle between the two, in order to be able to claim that evolution is possible. As usual, even those endeavours show that the theory of evolution faces an inescapable impasse.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One person disting\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uished by his efforts to marry thermodynamics and evolution is the Belgian scientist Ilya Prigogine.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Starting out from chaos theory, Prigogine proposed a number of hypotheses in which order forms from chaos (disorder). However, despite all his best efforts\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, he was unable to reconcile thermodynamics and evolution. This is clearly seen in what he says:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is another question, which has plagued us for more than a century: What significance does the evolution of a living being have in the world described by \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thermodynamics, a world of ever-increasing disorder?6
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Prigogine, who knows quite well that theories at the molecular level are not applicable to living systems, such as a living cell, stresses this problem:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The problem of biological order involves the tran\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sition from the molecular activity to the super-molecular order of the cell. This problem is far from being solved.7
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is the point most recently arrived at by the chaos theory and related speculations. No concrete outcome has been attained that would s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
upport or verify evolution, or eliminate the contradiction between evolution, law of entropy, and other physical laws.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Despite all these evident facts, evolutionists try to take refuge in simple subterfuges. Plain scientific truths show that living things \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and the ordered, planned, and complex structures of living things could in no way have come into being by coincidence under normal circumstances. This situation makes it clear that the existence of living beings can only be explained by the intervention o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a supernatural power. That supernatural power is the creation of God, who created the entire universe from nothing. Science has proven that evolution is still impossible as far as thermodynamics is concerned and the existence of life has no explanation b

 lies at the basis of the theory of evoluti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
on. Materialism rests on the supposition that everything that exists is matter. According to this philosophy, matter has existed since eternity, will continue to exist forever, and there is nothing but matter. In order to provide support for their claim, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 aterialists use a logic called "reductionism." This is the idea that things which are not observable can also be explained by material causes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To make matters clearer, let us take the example of the human mind. It is evident that the mind cannot be touche\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d or seen. Moreover, it has no centre in the human brain. This situation unavoidably leads us to the conclusion that the mind is a concept beyond matter. Therefore, the being which we refer to as "I," who thinks, loves, gets nervous, worries, takes pleasu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e or feels pain, is not a material being in the same way as a sofa, a table or a stone. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Materialists, however, claim that mind is "reducible to matter." According to the materialist claim, thinking, loving, worrying and all our mental activities are nothi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng but chemical reactions taking place between the atoms in the brain. Loving someone is a chemical reaction in some cells in our brain, and fear is another. The famous materialist philosopher }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150

 Gall, however, is matter, whereas there is no evidence that thought is. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Reductionism is a logical deduction. However, a logical deduction can be based on solid grounds or on shaky ones. For this \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 reason, the question we need to ask is: }{

that there is incredibly comprehensive information contained in the DNA of living things. Something as small as a hundred thousandth of a millimetre across contains a sort of "data bank" that specifies all the physical details of the body of a living thin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. Moreover, the body also contains a system that reads this information, interprets it and carries out "production" in line with it. In all living cells, the information in the DNA is "read" by various enzymes, and proteins are produced according to this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nformation. This system makes possible the production of millions of proteins every second, of just the required type for just the places where they are needed in our bodies. In this way, dead eye cells are replaced by living ones, and old blood cells by

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For instance, let us think of the source of a book. A book consists of}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7828150\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
paper, ink, and the information it contains. Paper and ink are material elements. The\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ir source is again matter: Paper is made of cellulose, and ink of certain chemicals. However, the information in the book is nonmaterial and cannot have a material source. The source of the information in each book is the mind of the person who wrote it. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Moreover, this mind determines how paper and ink will be used. A book initially forms in the mind of the writer. The writer builds a chain of logic in his mind, and orders his sentences. As a second step, he puts them into a material form, which is to say
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that he translates the information in his mind into letters, using a pen, a typewriter or a computer. Later, these letters are printed in a publishing house and take the shape of a book made up of paper and ink. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can therefore state this general conclus\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ion: "If physical matter contains information, then that matter must have been designed by a mind that possessed the information in question. First there is the mind. That mind translates the information it possesses into matter, which constitutes the act
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of design."

When we apply this scientific definition of information to nature, a very important result ensues. This is because nature overflows with an immense body of information (as, for example, in the case of DN\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A), and since this information cannot be reduced to matter, it therefore comes from a source beyond matter.

he theory of evolution has met a crushing defeat in palaeontology as well as in biochemical topics such as genes, DNA and the cell systems. Fossils demonstrate that living species did not evolve from each other, but were created 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 separately with their individual specific characteristics. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 According to the theory of evolution, all living species evolved from one another. A previously-existing species turned into another species over time and all species came into being in this manne\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r. According to the theory, this transformation has been over a very long period of hundreds of millions of years and proceeded gradually. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In that case, numerous }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "intermediary species"}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 should have originated and lived within this long alleged transformat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion period. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or some reptile-birds should have originated which had acquired some bird traits
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since they were in a transitory period, they had to be crippled, deficient, and defective living beings. Evolutionists refer to these theoretical creatures, which they believe to have lived in the pas
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , as }{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "transitional forms."}{\f0\fs22\insrsid538165\charrsid7828150 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If such animals had really existed in the past, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. Darwinism is shattered right at this point, because there is not a single trace of these imaginary "interme
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 diate transitional forms." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This fact has been known for a long time. Yet evolutionists speculated on a few fossils, trying to present them as "intermediate transitional forms" and comforted themselves saying, "only a few intermediate forms have been found
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 so far, but in the future all of them will be unearthed." The most important fossil presented as an intermediate form was a 150-million-year-old extinct bird fossil called Archaeopteryx. Evolutionists claimed that this bird had reptilian traits. Despite 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he fact that their claims have been refuted one by one and that it has been proved that Archaeopteryx was not an intermediate transitional form but a flying bird species, they desperately embraced this last fossil they had.
