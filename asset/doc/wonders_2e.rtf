The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1

His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author's books has a \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
symbolic meaning linked to the their contents. This seal represents the Koran as the last Book by Allah and the last word of Him and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Koran and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal t

 disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a si
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All these works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Koran to people, thus encouraging them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of Allah, His unity and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the hereafter, and to display the decrepit foundations and perverted works of godless systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re available in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they have been enjoyed by readers all over the world. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strik
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious thought to them can 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ny longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this will be only a sentimental insistence since these books have refuted these ideologies from their ver
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Koran. The author certainly does not \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for Allah's right path. Furthermore, no material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 pen the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideologi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cal chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Koran. The success, impac
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  and sincerity this service has attained are manifest in the reader's conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point needs to be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals Muslims undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Koranic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces pe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ple into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exagger\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ation to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the Will of Allah, these books will be the means through which people in the 21}{

hings on earth come into being? Imagine a huge planet with its surface completely empty. There are no humans or animals, no plants or insects. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Earth has been decorated in a lot of detail for living things to survive. Allah is the One Who has given earth a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ll these details. Otherwise none of us would have been able to live, neither you, nor your parents, or indeed any of your friends would have been here.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s consider how Allah created the earth so that living things can survive:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 1. Think about\'85\loch\f0  how orderl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y everything in the universe is. The sun has been put in the exact position from which it could warm us and give us light at the same time. If there were no sun, there would not have been one living thing on earth. Neither us, nor the animals nor any othe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  creatures would have been able to live.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Allah has also distanced the sun from earth to just the right extent. If earth was a little bit closer to the sun, the heat would have scorched it and we would not have been able to live. If earth was a little mo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re distant from the sun, then glaciers would have covered it and again, few living things would have been able to survive. This is one of the reasons why there is no life on other planets, because they are either too close to the sun or too distant from i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
3. As you know, living things need to breathe in order to live. We need oxygen in the air so that we can breathe. Exactly the right amount of oxygen exists in the air so that human beings can breathe. If there were a little bit more or a little bit less,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  neither we, nor the animals, nor the plants would have survived, because, as we have already said, we need to breathe in order to live. For this we need oxygen.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4. One of the most important things that make it possible for us to survive is water. No organ\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ism can live without water. For this reason, Allah has created some parts of earth as water. Three quarters of earth\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s surface is covered with water. However, there is no water on any of the other planets nor is there any water on the moon that you see at\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
night. The essentials for living things are only available on earth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Many events on earth make it possible for us to live. If even only one of these events doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t take place, no living thing would be left on earth. So, is it possible that these thousands 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of events have come together spontaneously and formed such a place as earth? Of course not. Not even one of these events could happen by chance. Allah has created earth for human beings. And, because of this, earth is the most suitable place for us.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You ca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n give the following example to those that claim earth and the whole universe were formed by chance. Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s say that you are playing on the beach and you see some big waves approaching, so you go home. When you return to the beach after a few hours, you se\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 an amazing sight. On the shore there is a wonderful city made of sand. There are houses, hospitals, an airport, and buses. There are even human figures. You ask a friend who is passing if he knows how these things occurred. If he replied, \'93\loch\f0 
 I think the b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 g waves that reached the shore must have formed them,\'94\loch\f0  what would you think? Wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t you be suspicious that your friend imagined it, or wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t you laugh thinking that he must be joking or had perhaps become insane?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is impossible for waves to have for\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 med such a perfect city from sand by coincidence. It is obvious that someone who is an expert in building such cities had arrived, built it and left. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, certain people \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  even though they are professors or scientists \hich\f0 \endash \loch\f0  accept such a ridiculous idea. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 They won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
t say, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Waves formed the city made of sand\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0 , but they would say \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Tiny pieces of matter, namely the atoms, came together by chance and they formed the sun, stars and earth all by themselves.
\'94\loch\f0  This is because these people wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to say that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
llah created everything. They defend the wrong without believing in the right. We will explain who these people are in more detail towards the end of the book.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So how do meteors cause great damage to the surfaces of other planets but not to the surface of earth?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason fo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r this is the atmosphere that surrounds earth. The atmosphere encircles our planet as a protective shield. A meteor entering the atmosphere shrinks through combustion. When it comes closer to the surface of earth, it becomes even smaller. Therefore, the m

\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid4089905\charrsid12391684 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we explained earlier, after the Big Bang, particle\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s emerged and came together as ATOMS. Well, do you know what an atom is? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us first explain to you what an atom is like. We can compare the atoms to marbles. But these marbles would be too tiny, unlike anything you have seen before.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, look around you\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
! Everything that you see in reality is made of these marbles, namely the atoms. The chair on which you are sitting, the book in your hand, your mother, your teacher at school, the television that you watch, apples, melons, and the chocolates in the kitch
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n, your pet, water, the flowers in your garden, your toys, and even your body, all are made up of these atoms. As we explained earlier, the stars and suns that make up the universe and the world in which we live are also formed of atoms just like you. In 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ll the places in which you go about and all the corners that you turn, there are atoms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You cannot see these little things that we call atoms, because they are a lot smaller than you can imagine. They are so small that even with the largest microscopes, it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t possible to see even one of them. To be able to comprehend the tiny size of the atom, look at this example:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 Imagine that you have a key in your hand. Without a doubt, it is impossible for you to see the atoms that make up this key. If you say, \'93\loch\f0 I mu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 st see these atoms\'94
\loch\f0 , then you must visualise the key to be as large as earth. If you were able to visualise the key to be as large as earth then every atom inside it would be as large as cherries and so you could see them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, how did all the atoms come\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  together after the Big Bang? The atoms are lifeless. They don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 
t have any minds or any intelligence. They cannot make any decisions. They cannot say, for example, \'93\loch\f0 Come on, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 s get together and form a star\'94\loch\f0 \hich\f0  or \'93\loch\f0 Let\hich\f0 \rquote

\loch\f0 s get together and form a castl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0  or a human!\'94

How did all these stars, planets, humans and animals that are made up of atoms come into being? If the atoms did not make a decision, then who put them together?\'94

\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid4089905\charrsid12391684 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We have said that atoms come together to form human beings, but, of cou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rse, you must be wondering how this can happen. First, atoms come together to form CELLS. Again, we are learning something new: So, what is a cell?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The bodies of all living organisms are made up of cells. Even if cells are not as small as atoms, they are s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
till very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye. We can try to explain their tiny size with the following example: If we brought together about 10,000 cells, we could make up something just about the size of the head of a pin. This is why you cannot
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 see them. But cells are the building blocks of humans, ants, cats, roses, trees, and all other living organisms around you. You, for instance, are made up of trillions of cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, where did all these trillions of cells come from?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Look at your brother. He\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  wasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t there two years ago, then all of a sudden he appeared and slowly he started to grow. How did this amazing event happen?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Your brother started out as a single cell in your mother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s abdomen. But this single cell was storing a lot of important informat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ion inside. All the information that has made your brother into who he is used to be stored in this cell: his eye colour, hair colour, height, etc.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then this cell grew a little and started to divide. First, it divided in two. However, here something happen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed that you would find very interesting: The information in the cell did not divide into two. That means the same information was duplicated in the two cells. After this, the cells continued to divide and the same information duplication happened in all o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  them, resulting in many cells with the same information. Then these were divided into others, and others divided into others. This event continued until millions of cells formed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 While all this was happening, something you would never guess took place!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These cells, although they contain the same information, started doing tasks that are different from each other. Some of them formed your brother\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s skin. Some others formed his muscles, yet others his skeleton, and others his brain neurons.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 While the cells\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  continued to multiply, the group of cells that was almost like a ball started to take shape. As you can see in the pictures at the top of the page, first your brother\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the things that we have said until now may surprise you. You probably have thought about why cells took on different tasks or how t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eing. It is nonsense to even think that your brother or other human beings are made up of cells that came together by coincidence.

Allah created all humans with eyes with which they can see. Allah has given humans this very important asset.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Our eyes serve\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  very important functions. They perform critical processes of which we are completely unaware, and only after which we can see around.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us briefly examine how we see: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Every object in the world reflects and emits light on to its surroundings. For instan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ce, while you are looking at this book, the light reflected and emitted from this book is going to the back of your eye through your pupil.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This light, after going through a series of processes at the back of your eye, turns into an electrical signal. This\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 electrical signal goes to your brain. At the back of your brain is the centre of vision that makes it possible for you to see. The centre of vision is a small area. This is the tiny area where the electrical signals form the image of the book and that is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 when you see this book. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even trying to explain these processes as briefly as possible takes such a long time, whereas the process is instantaneous. These processes happen so fast that when you look at the book, at that instant you are able to see it.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Isn\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t it such a perfect system? If you remember, we had mentioned evolutionists earlier in the book. We also mentioned that these people believe that earth, the universe, the stars and all living things are a result of chance. Those who say this say the same 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 bout our eyes. They say, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The eyes occurred by themselves and through coincidence.\'94\loch\f0 
 Can such a complex and wonderful system form by itself? Let us give an example to clarify how ridiculous this opinion is: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Engineers have manufactured the photographic and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
video cameras by copying the human eye. However, none of this equipment gives as clear a view as your eyes do. Now lift your head from the book and look around you. Isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t your vision clear? There is no blur, snowy dots or missing lines in your vision. Now\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 look at your television set. Quite often, you see snowy dots or skipped lines in the image. Even when these don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t happen and even with all the new technology, televisions still do not produce the perfect images that your eyes do. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s think for a mo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ment. This means that our eyes are a lot more advanced and are of better quality than any video or photographic camera or television. What would you do if someone came up to you and said something like the following?
\par \loch\af0\dbch\af13\hich\f0 \'93\loch\f0 There was a storm that caused some ele\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ctrical cables, screws, hammers, screwdrivers to fly out the door and windows, to fly out of the house, and then all of them got together in the backyard. Then there was some rain and thunder and these things were mixed with the soil. Some time passed and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 I saw a television set emerge. I picked it up and brought it home.\'94\loch\f0  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You would probably think that that person is either insane or lying, because as we all know, television sets are made in huge factories where there are hundreds of engineers, designers an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d specialised personnel. It is impossible for a television set to form on its own.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Could it be that our eyes, which are of much better quality than television, have occurred by themselves? Of course not! Just as a television doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t come about on its own, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
but someone does manufacture it, our eyes are also not a result of coincidence. Allah is the One Who created our eyes in such a way that they see in three-dimensions and with coloured images so clearly. This is why we have to thank Allah for everything be
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 utiful that we are able to see.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After creating earth, Allah created many \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
living things on it. One of these living things is the human being. We told you earlier how the human being was created. There are beings other than humans on this planet. These are the animals and plants. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this section, we will explain the amazing feat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

t given a lot of thought to their unique features.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When Allah \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
creates people, He gives them some features to constantly remind them of Him. For example, you can see the pictures of a human and a mosquito on this page. The mosquito is thousands of times smaller than the human. But, no matter what, the human is totall
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 defenceless against the mosquito while sleeping in bed. Whatever she does, she will not be able to prevent the mosquito from biting. Allah has given the mosquito many special features, even though it is a lot smaller than the human being. As a result of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his, He wants humans to ponder. He wants them to understand that humans can do nothing, even against a mosquito, without His wish. In this way, human beings should realise that they have absolutely no power in front of Allah.

Did you ever get the chance to look at a mosquito closely? If not, look at the picture on the previous page and we can study it together. Do you know why the abdomen of this mosquito is red? His abdomen is red because it is filled with the blood of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he person on whom the mosquito has landed. Why do mosquitoes suck blood? Many people believe that the mosquitoes feed on blood. In reality, mosquitoes feed on flower nectar.

t leave her eggs at random. She aligns them neatly side-by-side. The eggs resemble a raft. Do you know why the mother mosquito arranges her eggs in this shape? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 She gives her \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eggs this shape because, since they have been left on water, the eggs could easily sink. If they are linked in this way, the risk of sinking will no longer be there. The white eggs that the mother lines up with care immediately begin to darken. Insects an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  birds don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t notice these eggs because their colour is dark. In this way, the eggs are safe from being attacked by insects and birds. So, from where does a tiny mosquito egg learn to change its colour? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Obviously, this tiny egg couldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have this knowledge\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . The mosquito that is the mother of this egg also can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Wait! The mosquito\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s adventure has only just begun. The little ones inside the egg soon turn into wormlike creatures called larvae. These larvae, as you can see on the next page, stay in water with their heads upside down. How do you \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
think these larvae breathe when their heads are in water? Allah has created them with an organ that allows them to breathe. Do you know what this organ looks like? It looks like the diver\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s snorkel the child in the next picture is using. This is a tube an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the top of it stays out of water. The air that goes through this tube allows the tiny mosquito that is under water to breathe. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, there is an important problem. This tube stays out of water but even the slightest wave could cause water to enter it \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 and this would mean that the tiny mosquito would drown. This doesn
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t happen. A sticky substance at the end of this tube prevents water from entering it. Do you think that the larvae you see in the picture could have said, \'93\loch\f0 Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, the little mosquitoes chang\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e their skins a couple of times. Finally, they take the shape that you see on the left. It still doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When you get a cut, after a while, your blood stops dripping of its own accord. This is because blood can coagulate and stop flowing. Allah has created blood with this unique quality to pro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tect human beings. If blood did not coagulate on its own, the tiniest cut on our finger or a wound from a fall while running could cause you to die since you wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t be able to stop the bleeding.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is quite a vital benefit for us. However, mosquitoes m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ight not be too happy about it. Why? Because, just when the mosquito starts to suck our blood, it would harden and not go up the mosquito
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s tube. If this were so, the mosquito would not have existed, because none of the mosquitoes would have been able to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eed protein to their eggs. Again, Allah has created mosquitoes with a unique skill that is just right for this process. How? Before the mosquito begins to suck blood, it secretes a special liquid, given it by Allah, into the blood vessel of the person on 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hom it has landed. In this way, the blood in that area doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t coagulate and so the mosquito is able to suck it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This liquid has another rare quality. While the mosquito does all these things, you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel a thing, because this substance numbs the area \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that the mosquito cuts. This liquid is just like a anaesthetic the dentist or surgeon uses. Doctors administer a certain drug so that you won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t feel pain, and you don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t. You see, the mosquito works just like a doctor. First, it anaesthetises and then it s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cks. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After the mosquito bites you, you feel a little itching and swelling. The reason for this itching and swelling is this liquid. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You might think that all these things take a long time. The mosquito, however, manages most of these in a very short time.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 You feel the bite of the mosquito only after it has finished its job and packed away its equipment. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s think together. The mosquito is as large as the tip of a pencil, but the jobs it manages are very important and complex. Do you think that it i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s possible for a mosquito to think all of these things through? To prevent the flow of a human\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s blood, to anaesthetise the area that it cuts so that it doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t cause pain, to make an eye that can see easily even at night, to arrange its eggs in the shape\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of a raft so that they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0 t sink\'85\loch\f0 
 It could not invent any of these, right? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah has created every living being with the features most suitable for it so that they can feed themselves, protect themselves and survive. This shows just how caring, merciful \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and protective Allah is. If a mosquito is able to continue its life, for example, then this is because Allah is protecting it. Allah neither misses anything, nor does He forget. This is why everything that a mosquito needs is complete. Nothing is missing.

We have so far mentioned the special features of the mosquito. In reality, all the insects that we see around us have interesting features. For example, flies are able to fly superbly from the moment t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hat they are born. We can even say that, when it comes to flying, flies are the most talented creatures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A fly can flap its wings about 500 to 1000 times per second. Stop here and think for a moment. The frame of time that we mention is not an hour and no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t a minute; it is just a second. That is, it is about the same time as the time in which you close and open your eyes. You see; the fly has flapped its wings at least 500 times while you closed and opened your eyes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now think about the following: What wou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ld you do if you were asked to open and close your arms only 10 times and not 500 times? Without a doubt it is impossible for you to manage this 500 times with the type of muscles your body has. The fly, with its extraordinary body muscles, manages this t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sk that neither you nor mature adults can perform. Moreover, flies do not feel any difficulty while flapping their wings; their wing muscles do not wear out. This is because Allah has created them with such a magnificent system. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you were to watch a fly\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 closely, you would witness that it experiences no difficulty while taking off; this may not have seemed surprising to you and you may have taken this for granted. However, this is a very important and difficult move. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You know quite a lot about helicopter\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s and aeroplanes. Well, do you know how long humans have been able to use them? The machines that are able to fly today were developed only during the last century. This means that a hundred years ago, there were no aeroplanes or helicopters like the ones
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that exist today. Engineers and technicians researched for a very long time; they worked for many years and developed this machinery only a short while ago. Look, this is very important: Today, none of the machines that fly have the complete ability to ta
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 k\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e off like flies do. This feature exists in some helicopters to some extent. However, even after all these lengthy efforts and the strong specially-developed engines, these helicopters still do not have the ability to fly as perfectly as flies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, exami\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ne the first fly that you come upon. See what you notice: you will notice especially that the fly doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t fly in a straight line. The fly can take off towards any destination it wants by making manoeuvres. It can, for example, zigzag in the air, and make \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
brupt turns. It can land on any surface, no matter how unsuitable. It can even land on ceilings or vertical walls with ease. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 No flying machine can manage all these things. Try to imagine in your mind\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s eye the take-off of an aeroplane and a fly, and decid\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e which one is more successful.

In a beehive, there is one queen, a few hundred male bees and a workforce of thousands of infertile female bees, the worker bees. (The total number of bees in the beehive can reach 80,000). The worker bees perform all the activities inside the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hive. Some duties of the worker bees are as follows:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Building the honeycomb, cleaning and protecting the hive, feeding the queen bee and the male bees, caring for the bee larvae, and feeding them with the royal jelly, honey and pollen, building cells for t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he eggs to grow in, cleaning these rooms, maintaining the heat and moisture inside the hive, collecting nectar, pollen, water and resin, etc.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We had mentioned earlier the life story of a mosquito. Now, let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s take a look together at what type of life the wo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rker bee leads.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A worker bee lives between 4 to 6 weeks. For 3 weeks after its birth it lives inside the hive. Its first job is to take care of the growing bees. It feeds the baby bees with the honey and pollen it takes from storage. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the worker bee b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecomes 12 days old, suddenly, beeswax starts to be produced in its body. The beeswax is extremely important for bees, because the bees build their honeycombs with beeswax. You will see the picture of a honeycomb when you turn the page.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Isn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t it neat? Could\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 you have made such neat hexagons side by side without a ruler? Furthermore, take a blank piece of paper and start to draw hexagons from one end of the paper while a friend starts to draw from the other. Were you able to come up with a neat honeycomb shap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , right in the middle of the paper, without leaving any spaces? You weren\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t able to, right? This is something that even adults are unable to manage. Your teachers, parents, even your grandparents would not be able to achieve such a task. To be able to do \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his, you would need some instruments and you would have to do very complicated calculations. However, the tiny bee, even when it is just 12 days old, can make such a perfect honeycomb. What's more, it does this without using any instruments.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the bees s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tart making hexagonal honeycombs from the corners, and meet in the middle. You might have noticed that the honeycombs are the same height. How can a bee manage such tasks that even humans are not able to carry out and with such excellence? You see Allah i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the One Who lets the bee do these things. Allah has created the bee with this talent. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The responsibilities of the worker bee are not just these. Among its duties, until it is 3 weeks old, are storing royal jelly and pollen in the honeycombs, keeping the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
beehive clean and throwing dead bees and garbage outside the beehive. During the last stage of its 3-week duty, it starts its last task of serving as a security guard and protecting the beehive from enemies. When the three weeks are over, the bee becomes 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 killed enough to collect royal jelly, pollen and water. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The worker bee becomes exhausted after working non-stop for another 2 to 3 weeks and dies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During their brief lives, the bees work non-stop. In addition, no one teaches them the work that they are s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
upposed to do. They start to work straight after birth. Just think, if a new-born baby were to get out of its bed, first make its bed, wash up, and then begin to take care of the other babies; wash them, feed them, dress them. Isn\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 t this just impossible? \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 et, bees manage such an impossible task, because Allah has created them with the capabilities to do so.

indicate the distance of the food source from the hive. By the end of the dance, the other bees have understood the location of the food source and they quickly leave for the flowers that are their new food source. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Where do you think tiny bees have learnt\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  how to communicate by dancing? Of course, the One Who has given them this knowledge is their Creator and Protector, Allah.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is because Allah has created them in such a way that th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ey can live in such a freezing environment. Penguins\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 bodies and their features are very different from ours. Due to this, they can live in the coldest weather without any difficulties. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah has covered penguins\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  bodies with a very thick layer of fat, so\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that they won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The penguin displays great devotion towards its eggs and babies. Penguins incubate their eggs during the coldest weather. Unlike other creatures, it is not the female penguin that incubates the eggs but the male. The female penguin lays only
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  one egg and then leaves it to the male. She leaves for distant places to find food for her husband and baby. Because of all the ice and snow that surrounds them, she has to travel far to be able to find food.

drink inside them for long periods and they quench their thirst with the water they carry within them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Feeding is also a problem in the desert, since the desert is dry land and there is almost no vegetation. There are only cactuses and other thorny plants\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . The camel\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

There are very frequent sandstorms in the desert. Did you ever witness a strong wind when you were at the beach? You would not have been able to open your eyes because you had to try to prevent all the sand from getting in them. If tha

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah has created every \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 living thing with the features that are most suitable for their habitat. There are no penguins in the desert, for instance. Since the penguin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 the correct temperature setting. Right then, another thing happened by chance: the oven\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We will say, for instance, that there is a herd of deer and that predators are constantly at\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tacking this pack. In this case, the deer will start to run fast and only the fastest running and most agile deer will survive. In time, weak and slow deer will completely disappear, as the predators hunt them down. There would only be healthy and strong

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The events we have mentioned until this moment are correct, but they have nothing to do with evolution. Evolutionists say that a deer, after continuously evolvi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fairy tales. You probably all know the story about the frog that turns into a prince. A frog can turn into a prince only in a fairy tale. However, it is impossible for a deer to change into a lion or another living thing in real life. However, evolutioni

 it and waits for it to become a prince. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can conclude that: Natural selection can never change a species of animals into another species, for example a deer into a lion or a giraffe. It can only cause the members of that animal species, a herd of deer

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another such event took place in the Russian city Chernobyl in 1986. There \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
was an explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, and this caused radiation to spread over the whole city, surrounding areas and even as far as Western Europe. Just as in Japan, the people who were living there at the time and their children who were born 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ubsequently either became crippled or died of radiation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The pictures that you have seen all show how people and other living things have been crippled after mutating as a result of radiation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You could ask what does this have to do with our topic? We me\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ntioned earlier that evolutionists claim that living things turned into other species and this is how they evolved. They, for instance, say that fish turned into reptiles. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you were to ask, how can a fish turn into a reptile, they would reply: One day a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fish mutates, that means that it goes through an event just like the children in Japan who were exposed to radiation. Because of this mutation, the body of the fish goes through some changes and one day, millions of years later, you would come across a c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ocodile that used to be a fish!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This claim is nonsense. Furthermore, as we mentioned above, mutations are always harmful to living creatures. They either cripple them or make them very sick. Nonetheless, the theory of evolution still maintains that mutatio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ns have caused the fish to evolve and changed them into reptiles. This is just too fantastically unbelievable for anyone to believe.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If mutations were beneficial, when the radiation leak occurred, everyone would have gone to Chernobyl to evolve into more a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dvanced beings. In fact, everyone has fled from Chernobyl, and the adverse affects of Chernobyl incident are still evident. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can compare evolutionists\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  claims with the following example: If you took hold of an axe and hit a black and white television wi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
th it, could you change this television into a coloured one? Of course not! If you randomly hit a television with an axe, you would end up with a smashed set. Just as hitting something haphazardly with an axe produces damage, mutations harm living beings.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 That is to say, mutations don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t turn a living creature into something better, as evolutionists argue. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then, let us summarise what we have mentioned until now: Evolutionists claim that a creature evolves into another creature or a species into another spe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cies. They say that these changes occur as a result of two things, mutations and natural selection, but we have already seen that neither natural selection nor mutation can change the features of a living being. Furthermore, mutations cause damage to livi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g beings, as we have seen in the pictures.

We had mentioned earlier that it is now thought that Allah created the universe in the big bang. The whole universe, planets, stars and our own earth were formed after this enormous explosion. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To begin with, there were no livings beings on our planet, but then Allah created all living things on earth; birds, insects, trees, flowers, fish, tigers, butterflies, elephants and giraffes etc.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Well, do you know when the first living creatures appeared\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
? This happened during the period called the Cambrian about 500 million years ago. The first creatures that lived during this period were ones like snails, worms and starfish. The creatures that lived during the Cambrian period also prove that the theory

 from whom they evolved. That is, Allah created them. Furthermore, these creatures that lived during the Cambrian period had very special features. For example, there used to be a creature called the trilobite that lived during the Cambrian period, but we
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
do not see them now because they are extinct. The Trilobite had very complex but perfect eyes. Its eyes, as you can see on the right, were made of hundreds of honeycomb-shaped cells and these cells allowed it to see very clearly. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Do you think that a creat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 ure like this could just appear out of nowhere? If your little brother came to you and said, \'93\loch\f0

 breathe with their gills and so they would die. They would need to have lungs. Let us just suppose that a fish made up its mind to go on land, where would it get a lung from? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Fish do not have a kidney system like ours, but they need one to live on lan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d. Probably they found kidneys lying somewhere when they decided to go on land!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. Fish do not have feet. This is why they cannot walk when they reach shore. Just how did the first fish that decided to go on land find feet? As this is impossible, it is obv\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

3. Birds have a unique skeletal system and their bones are hollow. This makes them lighter and makes it easier for them to fly.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These are just a few differences that immediately come to mind. There are many\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  more differences between these creatures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a species of reptile had turned into birds, there ought to have been many creatures that had lived in between the reptiles and the birds representing the phases of this change.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Fossil hunters should have been \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
able to come across at least one of these fossils. That is, there must have been creatures with half wings, half feathered and half scaled bodies, half beaks and half mouths, and their fossils should have been found, but no such creature exists among the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
any fossils on earth. The fossils that are found belong either to a complete reptile or to a complete bird. This means that birds did not evolve from reptiles. Allah created birds just as He has created all other living things. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, since evolutionist\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t want to accept this, they try to convince people by inventing stories. How?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 They have found the fossil of a bird called the Archaeopteryx and they have said that this bird is a transitional form between a dinosaur and a bird. They said, \'93\loch\f0 The Archae\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Now let us give a scientific example. There was a scientist called Newton who lived in the last century who claimed that there is something called the \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 gravity\'94\loch\f0  on earth. He replied to those who asked him how he knew t

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Therefore, evolutionists have to show some proof to make their theories\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd half human creatures shown in the above drawing has ever existed. This is far too unlikely to happen. As we stated earlier, not one fossil has been found to prove it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, evolutionists constantly try new tricks on this topic. For example, while han\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dling a fossil that belongs to an extinct species of apes, they claim it to be the fossil of a creature that was between apes and humans. As people are often not well informed about this topic, they are prone to believe the things that evolutionists say. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Evolutionists show the fossils of humans belonging to different races as if they are fossils of creatures that are half apes and half humans.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As you know, there are many different ethnic groups of people on earth. There are people belonging to different\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 ethnic groups such as the Africans, Chinese, Red Indians, Turks, Europeans, Arabs and many others. Obviously, people belonging to different ethnic groups sometimes have different features. For example, the Chinese have eyes that are withdrawn to the back
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ;\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 some Africans have very dark skins and very curly hair. When you see a Red Indian or an Eskimo, you immediately know that they belong to a different ethnic group. You see, in the past, there were people of many other ethnic groups and some of their featu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es were perhaps different from those of people today. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, the skulls of people belonging to the Neanderthal race were bigger than the skulls of people living today. Their muscles were a lot stronger than ours. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists, however, used the di\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 fferences between this race and ours as a way to deceive people. They say, for instance, when they find the fossil of a Neanderthal skull, \'93\loch\f0 
This is the skull of humans\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 \hich\f0  ancestors who have lived tens of thousands of years ago\'94\loch\f0 . Sometimes the skull fossils \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
ound were smaller than the average skull size of humans today. Holding a skull fossil, evolutionists say, \'93\loch\f0 \hich\f0 The owner of this skull was just at the point of changing from an ape into a human\'94\loch\f0 .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In reality, even today there are people belonging to different e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thnic groups that have smaller than average skulls. For example, the skull volume of Aborigines (Australian natives)is quite small, but this does not mean that they are half ape and half human. They are normal human beings just like you and all other huma
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  beings. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Consequently, we can see that the fossils evolutionists show as proof of humans evolving from apes either belong to earlier species of apes or human races that are now extinct. This means that half human and half ape creatures have never existed.

For instance, during the excavations of a cave in Spain, the fossils of a child who had lived about 800 thousand years ago were found. The face of this child had the same features as those of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
children today. However, if it was as evolutionists claim, there should have been no humans present 800 thousand years ago. There should have been half human half-ape creatures 800 thousand years ago. It was clear, when the fossil in Spain was found, that
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 humans have existed as humans since they were first created. There have never been any half human and half ape creatures.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Scientists discovered the remains of a stone hut. When they calculated its age, they concluded that it was at least 1,5 million yea\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 claims such as that humans evolved from apes, and that fi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 st there was primitive man (half human, half ape) who then evolved into today\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s mankind.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. One of the oldest fossils found to date is that of the Turkana Boy, which is about 1.6 million years old. When the fossil was closely examined it was discovered tha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4. Humans, among all living things, are the only creatures that can walk upright on two feet. Animals such as the horse, the dog and the ape are four-legged, and animals such as snakes, crocodiles and lizards are reptiles. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
claims that, millions of years ago, four-legged apes changed their walking style into a bent position. The apes continued to walk bent until their walk became upright. As a result, the human form was established. These claims made by the theory of evoluti
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n are not based on any scientific evidence but are rather based on total imagination. Studies made by scientists in recent years have proven that this claim of the evolutionists is totally unscientific nonsense!
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Studies have shown that creatures best use t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 heir energies when they walk on either two feet or four. Creatures spend twice the energy when they try to walk bent and out of their natural posture. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then, why would the apes walk bent, spending twice the energy, for thousands of years? It would be the s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ame as if an adult human tried to crawl with a full load on his back. Would you, while able to walk comfortably on your two feet, suddenly decide to do a handstand and walk henceforth on your palms? Obviously, no creature would switch from a relaxed walki
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g style to an uncomfortable walking style. Allah has created each creature with the ability to move in the most comfortable way. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 In conclusion, the theory of evolution cannot answer the question, \'93\loch\f0 Why did four-legged apes decide one day to walk on only tw\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 o?\'94\loch\f0  }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of these components have such intricate detail that it is impossible for them to have come about by chance. If just one of them, for example the lens, were missing, the eye could not function. Moreover, if just the le
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ns and the pupil were to exchange positions, the eye could not function. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even the tear that seems such a simple fluid is essential for the eye to function. An eye that does not produce tears will soon dry up and become blind. Furthermore, the tear's antis\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eptic properties protect the eye from germs. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The structure of an eye can be compared to that of a car. Many pieces make up a car. If all of its pieces were together but the gas pedal was missing, you would not be able to drive it. If one of the wires in i

robable that 40 different pieces come together at the same time and at the same place? This implies that pupil, lens, retina, eyelids, eye ducts, and others had to form by chance and join by themselves. This, of course, is impossible!
