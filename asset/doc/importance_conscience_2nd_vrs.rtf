The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and ph\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ilosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related, and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the invalidity of their claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron [as]) and "Yahya" (John [as]), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ght against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet (saas)'s seal on the cover of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (saas), the last of the prophets. Under 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of the author's works center around one goal: to convey the Qur' an' s message to people, encourage them to think about basi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
c faith-related issues (such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the hereafter), and to expose the feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Ind\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
onesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enj

Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, as well as the sincere and easy
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
-to-understand style, gives these books a distinct touch that directly effects any one who reads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. It is unl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
kely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate materialistic philosophy, atheism, or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insiste
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ce, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ervice are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into a downward spiral of violence, corrupti
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of Allah, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hese books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

 is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore Allah's Existence, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
refore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, one that is strongly related to religion. It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Therefore, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of Qur'anic verses, and all people are invited to learn Allah's words and to live by the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
m. All the subjects that concern Allah's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain, and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This book and all the other works of the author can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in the sense that they will be able to relate their o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 wn reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to religion to contribute to the presentation and reading of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All of the author's books are extreme
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ly convincing. For this reason, for those who want to communicate true religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other boo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 begin after death, and everyone will meet different circumstances in the hereafter according to his or her conduct in this world. It does not suit people's purposes to follow their conscience in a life which they spend in joking and playing around, and b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 rote, without giving a thought to it at all. Everyone pursues plans they will benefit from in the life of this world, but none of these plans concern death or the hereafter. Death, however, is a reality far more absolute than all of these planned events.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 People, however, never take death into consideration. They try to live their lives as if they will never die.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What may then be the reason that the majority of people live by ignoring this important fact? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To answer this question, you must take a moment to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
think; how many times in your entire life have you thought about death? Have you ever thought that one day you will die, all your loved ones who buried you under the earth will then leave your grave and get on with their daily lives, and everything you ev
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r had will be gone upon your death? Have you ever visualised how death takes place? Your flesh will rot under the soil, but what will your soul experience?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Man has a soul and the soul does not disappear. After man dies, a new life starts for his soul, but \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
has he ever happened to wonder what kind of a new life awaits him? Like the majority of people, he, too, may have never thought about such things. This is because thinking about them makes people feel horrified. They try to avoid these facts as much as po
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sible. When this subject is brought up, they try to dismiss its impact on them with jokes or flippant remarks. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Why, then, do almost all people try so strongly to escape this reality which is certain to happen one day? Will ignoring prevent it from happeni\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng? Of course it will not. The reason people avoid thinking about death and the hereafter is that it prods their conscience into action, reminding them that they are answerable to Allah and that they will give an account of their actions after death. At t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e moment the conscience awakes, everything that has been done until then loses its importance, and man comes to realise the subjects that are really important. When he thinks that he will die one day, what importance are the things he has done in the life
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of this world? Initially, it may perhaps be difficult for him to grasp this, but thinking of the exact moment of death in fine detail, will help him understand all the truths.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Death may come to you when you least expect it, and most likely you will have no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  chance to make any preparations. It could be now or in a few moments, or at a similar moment a few years hence.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What is the source of the power of the self? The answer is evident in Surat ash-Shams where it is stated that fujoor (all evil) is inspired in the self. At this point, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

verses 7-10 in Surat ash-Shams will make it clear that the self is also inspired into guarding against evil. This means that positive powers, as well as negative powers, are present in the self. The self of every human\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 being possesses both a power that commands evil and presents it as good, and a positive power that commands guarding against evil, and choosing what is good and}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328

n this book, there is not sufficient time to do more than touch upon some qualities of the shaytan and the negative power he exerts against conscience. Even so, it should be}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The shaytan disobeyed Allah and did not prostrate to Prophet Adam. Because of his jealousy and arrogance, he}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
decided to lead human beings, whom he considered to be}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 inferior to him, ast\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ray from Allah's way. In the Qur'an, it is}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mentioned that the shaytan gives false desires to the hearts, tries to make people doubt the existence of Allah and the}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hereafter, and makes the life of this world seem attractive to}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 people. In fact, the shaytan i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s the representation of the negative powers that are present in the self. While a man's conscience always directs him to the right, the shaytan always directs him to the wrong.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the shaytan does not do this self-evidently. He has various methods th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at he uses surreptitiously. For instance, he may whisper to someone: 'You are a good person; you say}{
\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
you are a Muslim; if paradise exists, you will go there'. Perhaps this person neither practises regular prayers, nor the other commands of Allah, but the s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
haytan makes him feel confident that saying 'I'm a Muslim' is sufficient. He does not make him deny the existence of the hereafter outright, but he makes him lead a life near to disbelief under the name of Islam. What is more important is that the person,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 unaware that this is a}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
deliberate plan devised by the shaytan to drag him into hell, takes the shaytan's whispers as his own thoughts. Here, it should not be forgotten that conscience always tells one to live the real Islam, but most people follow the sayi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ngs of the}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 shaytan instead of their conscience because it suits the}{\f0\insrsid7999328

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is where we understand the importance of}{\f0\insrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 show up. Both call the person to its own way. Those who can distinguish between these two sounds and follow their conscience gain the good pleasure of Allah. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another vital point to be understood is that the shaytan w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ill not leave man until death, or even beyond death to the point that the soul is led to hell. This should never be}{\f0\insrsid7999328

laim of interest only to the scientific world and makes it of great importance to society as a whole is its ideological dimension. The answer it gives to the question of how living things, including mankind, came into existence makes Darwinism the basis o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a number of philosophies, worldviews and political ideologies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here, we shall consider the relationship between Darwinism and materialist philosophy. Materialist philosophy, or "materialism," is a system of thought going as far back as ancient Greece. Mat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erialism rests on the assumption that matter is the only thing that exists. According to materialist philosophy, matter has always existed, and will continue to do so for all time. Again according to this philosophy, nothing exists beyond matter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Naturally\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, materialism is also reflected in the political arena, with communism indisputably taking pride of place in this regard. Karl Marx (1818-83) and Friedrich Engels (1820-95), regarded as the founders of communism, were also the founders of dialectical mate
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ialism. In any case, communism is nothing more than materialist philosophy adapted to the social sciences by Marx and Engels.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Communism is today regarded as an ideology consigned to the wastes of history, whereas the fact is that it is still exceedingly in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fluential. The destructive effects of this ideology can still be felt in many countries. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is where Darwinism assumes great importance. Since Darwinism, or the theory of evolution, maintains that living things were not created but came into being by ch\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ance, it has received a wide acceptance among materialist ideologies, and has been adopted as the "basic foundation" of communism in particular. All the main communist ideologues have accepted the theory word for word, and have based their ideologies upon
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In a letter to Friedrich Engels in 1860, for instance, Karl Marx said of Darwin's book that "This is the book which contains the basis in natural history for our view."}{\f0\up4\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328

\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly Mao Tse Tung, the founder of Chinese communism, openly stated tha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t "The foundations of Chinese socialism rest on Darwin and the theory of evolution."}{

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ormed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , for ins

\par }{\f0\insrsid14298571\charrsid7999328 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical back
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 round, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest pl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ace you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the great
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
st television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge pre
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 V screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper se
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ormed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 housands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into el
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ctric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ace. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that only a complete silence prevails there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

me of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.
