Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deologies as fascism and communism.

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpos
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godles
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ide
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 logies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eans in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
adily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
or the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid5178182\charrsid1005842 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwini

over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par

 an activity, organization, etc." and "inert." When one refers to another as a "passive person," he means someone who lacks zeal, who is not concerned with the outside-world, or with the problems and trials of others, and who makes no effort to seek solut
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ons to their problems. One who is passive lives unto himself, immersed in his own little world. This book explores the nature of this human type, one who consciously adopts this lack of commitment, a degree of moral depravity which he then tries to impart
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 to the rest of the community. When commenting on this sort of character, we will refer to him as a "passive" person, that is, "one who advocates passivity." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Some, among the Muslims, are of a temper that is contrary to the zeal and enthusiasm expected of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
such efforts instead from a distance, being reluctant to grasp Allah's greatness, and to adopt the higher principles espoused in the Qur'an. Vitality is found neither in that which they do, nor in their understanding of faith.

ributes of moral perfection that please Allah, such as loving-kindness, sincerity, and loyalty. With their lack of enthusiasm and passivity, which they deliberately make apparent, they are aloof, insensitive and overly formal, and are those with whom it i

Because they rely on an errant outlook, rather than the Qur'an, their entire thinking is corrupt. Believers know that the real abode is the Hereafter, and that this life is only temporary, and thus, dedicate all their efforts for Allah's cause. Their purp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
se is to earn Allah's consent, mercy and Paradise. For this reason, they give importance to things of this world only to the extent they ought to, aspiring above all to the Hereafter. Those who are taken over by passivity, on the other hand, give excessiv

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who harbor such ignorance in their hearts, which they want to impart to the Muslims, are overly concerned about mundane matters. For instance, when they become sick, they fail to put their trust in Allah, succumbing inste

ad to excessive fear. Because they are overly concerned about their own selves, the possibility of any harm to their persons or to their interests leads them to over-exaggerated reactions. Diseases frighten them terribly, for they attach too much importan
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e to this world, and are not aware of the ultimate good in every aspect of the divine plan decreed by Allah. They are not relieved even if after being given a clean bill of health by several physicians, for they are consumed with unjustified concerns. For
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
relief, they invest their hopes in medicine and doctors. Of course, one who is sick must receive professional help from experts, and follow the treatment recommended by medical care providers. However, in doing so, he must be aware that neither the most e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fective medicine, nor the best doctors, can bring about a recovery unless Allah wills, for medicine, health care providers, or technology cannot be effective unless Allah wills so. Aware of the fact that it is Allah Who has ordained diseases as well as th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ir cures, believers put their trust in Allah and are submissive to Him. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The lack of composure and trust in Allah typical of those prone to passivity negatively influences those who have sickness in their hearts. Their doubts and volatile tempers also lead\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 those around them to make foolish comments and show the same lack of trust when faced with similar circumstances. Indeed, the major aim of these people is to foment chaos among the Muslims, and lead the impressionable or those of poor faith into confusio

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another attribute of those who are lethargic when abiding by the principles of the religion, is the deep admiration they feel for the ways of the ignorant. That which ignorant societies value\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
property, power and status\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 also impres\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 significant. However, due to their desires, rather than becoming true Muslims, they aim to acquire those attributes esteemed by ignorant societies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When referring to an issue, their comments convey the mindset of a person utterly unaware of Allah's existe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 forms us that the sole criterion is fear of Allah, and the esteem gained in this world is worthless in Allah's sight:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Taking precautionary \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 Faced with such a situation, a Muslim who trust\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 in Allah does not forget that everything has been predetermined, and for that reason feels no distress. Aware that this moment is also part of his destiny, as every other moment of his life, he confronts what happens to him with serenity. Furthermore, he

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is important to stress, at this point, that these people try their utmost not to exhibit moral character. As we said earlier, they \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
are not entirely ignorant about matters like compassion, sacrifice, faithfulness, mercy, patience, and all the other qualities that a good moral character is comprised of; indeed, they all know very well what these things are, and if you were to ask them,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they could quote the relevant verses of the Qur'an. But, they deliberately refuse to conform to these qualities, both because their faith is weak, and because they want to show that they do not esteem other Muslims. But, if these people knew that they wou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d derive some material reward for acting morally, they would offer every sort of self-sacrifice, and carry out to the full what was required of them. For example, if the one through whom they were to receive this gain were a high-level manager of a factor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, they would comply with everything he said, and be subservient in every way towards him. This does little to prove the morality of their character. On the contrary, they knew how they should have behaved, but refused to do so; this is a clear sign of the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r deceitfulness. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Although these people are far removed from the morality of the Qur'an, it is interesting to note that, when confronted with a difficult situation, they try to defend themselves to the Muslims by employing the Qur'an. They claim that what 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they had done was fated, that they did not mean to act wrongly, and that they must not be thought ill of. Their aim is to prevent the other from saying anything against them, and from using the Qur'an as a criterion to judge their behavior. Actually, Musl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ms are already well aware that everything is fated, and occurs through Allah's permission. However, to succeed in the trial that is this earthly life, they must evaluate events in light of the Qur'an. Therefore, they must be continually careful and take e

pontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were c

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evol
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid5178182\charrsid1005842 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\insrsid5178182\charrsid1005842 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\f0\insrsid5178182\charrsid1005842 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more common\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. }{

omatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that micro

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 enter of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
at no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with dept
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chanc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence woul
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and syste
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ms for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ighest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds

hat are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greate

When one refers to another as a "passive person," he means someone who lacks zeal, who is not concerned with the outside-world, or with the problems and trials of others, and who makes no effort to seek solutions to their problems. One who is passive live
