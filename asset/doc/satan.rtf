aused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it ap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explaine\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discuss\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ill look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, expl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
anations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s works share one single goal: to convey the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

 feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ide
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 logies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eans in humanity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

s hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 adily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  conviction.

morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 implying that the former is superior in substance to the latter. In other words, the entire basis of his arrogance is founded on the supposed physical difference in composition between the two substances. The fact is, however, that Allah created both man

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 iction.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Similarly, all who reject the commandments of Allah, as revealed in the Qur'an, interpreting His commands according to his personal desires, or seeks to demonstrate that the divine law is invalid, is guilty of the same error as Iblis. Like Iblis, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hey are aware of the existence of Allah, but fall into exactly the same failure of logic as he. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Due to his disobedience, Iblis was disgraced and ultimately expelled from his place in the presence of Allah. Iblis, who rebelled out of pride and arrogance, w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
as humiliated in a way so distasteful to his character. Therefore, before leaving Allah's presence, he requests Allah to be allotted a specific a period of time. He does not demand such a period that he may seek Allah's forgiveness, to turn back towards H
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m and express his repentance. Rather, his aim is to ignorantly seek retribution by dragging as many as he can into the same humiliation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thus it was that Satan's animosity and war against mankind was incepted. However, it must not be forgotten that Allah \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
created Satan, with all these propensities, and that he is a factor under our Lord's command. In other words, Satan has no power independent from Allah. Nevertheless, according to the deviant belief, widespread due the ignorance of today's societies, a po
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er struggle exists between Satan and Allah. Therefore, according to this opinion, when Satan manages to turn people away from the true path, he will have gained the victory over Allah (Allah is surely beyond that). 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The truth is, however, that Satan is onl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

First and foremost, Satan conceals the truth in order to lead people away from the path of salvation. The best way of doing so is by imparting devious falsehoods to people. He attempts to attract them to his ranks by means of lies and empty promises. For 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Satan's influence can take many forms. For example, one may have performed extraordinary service for the sake of Islam. This service is a blessing granted him by Allah, for it is He Who makes it possible. Since one cannot act outside

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Satan also seeks to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
disrupt the peace that exists between believers by inciting in them pride. Because, pride in believers is a vice, and one fraught with such a failing makes other believers exceedingly uncomfortable. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It must also be kept in mind that Satan ambushes people \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
very cunningly, and without making his influence known. Satan is in no hurry. He inspires people to regard themselves superior to others, but can effect this idea slowly, and over time. Unless one is on his or her guard against this form of deception, its
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
influence gathers strength. For instance, Satan will inevitably seize the opportunity to make such a suggestion following some minor success. If a person fails to recognize in his heart that this success was achieved by him, solely according to the will o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Allah, then he will be deluded by the suggestions made by Satan effecting in him pride. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Satan will also employ other tactics to this end. For instance, when a believer commits a mistake, then, the task of other believers is to reproach the believer in qu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
estion sympathetically, not forgetting that the offender is merely a powerless servant like themselves, because Satan will encourage feelings of anger or contempt towards him. Anyone who despises a believer for having committed an error, or for any other 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eason, is beginning to fall under the influence of Satan's desire to make him think himself superior. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If that errant perception persists, the person will eventually become arrogant, while any feelings of affection and compassion towards other believers wi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ll diminish. The end result is one who is unto himself, refuses to accept others' advice before acting, and who regards himself as superior in intelligence to other believers. Then, the insinuations that he ought to regard himself as superior increase, fu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ther confirming for him his false sense of superiority. Severe detriment can be caused to the faith of one who succumbs to such a state of mind. At some later time, as revealed in the Qur'an, his heart will shut itself off to the signs of Allah:

inflict suffering on one who does no one else any harm, who keeps to himself, and who, on the contrary, is helpful towards other people? (A person who thinks along those lines is actually attempting to justify himself.)

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This response was the fruit of Satan's inexplicable form of lo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Hypocrites often claim to have fear of Allah. Yet, none among them exhibits harboring such fear in their actions. This is yet another feature which hypocrites share with Satan. Despite declaring that he fears Allah, Satan nevert
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
heless commits terrible crimes, such as encouraging people to rebel. Instead of begging for Allah's forgiveness, he seeks to turn people from His path. Here is a further similarity he shares with the hypocrites: having no fear of Allah, nor showing that f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ar in their behavior, despite being aware of Allah's might.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This irrational lack of fear at times prompts the hypocrites to try to deceive Allah. The case of the mindset of the hypocrites referred to in Surat at-Tawba is one instance of this. Under the pre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tense of giving to charity and spending of their wealth in His cause, it is increase in property which they seek from Allah. When Allah increases their wealth, they become miserly, thus failing in their promise to Him.

kinds of despicable behavior, like lies and slander. They contrive responses completely removed from the truth of the situation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The constriction of the conscience of those who knowingly formulate false interpretations is easily discerned in their faces a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The insincerity of the hypocrites is referred to in several verses of the Qur'an. The hypocrites at the time of our Prophet (saas), who had claimed in time of war that their houses were exposed (Surat al-Ahzab, 13), who cited the conditi

why Satan is unwilling that people live according to the religion of Allah is that he knows that it is in this way that he will wreak destruction upon them. There is no question, however, of whether or not Satan is hostile towards Allah. Ultimately, thoug
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, he is merely a being created by Allah, and pursues his objective only by His leave. When the time allotted him expires, Satan will be cast into Hell to suffer punishment, together with all those people he caused to stray from the true path.

 could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved fro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid1129900 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let evolutionists put plenty of materi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
als present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and as many proteins\hich\f0 
\emdash \loch\f0 a single one of which has a formation probability of 10-950\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of yea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 llions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid1129900 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject tha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. Wit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ven be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nstance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
roduced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground ap
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and dist\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
inct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? H
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The sam
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by tra
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 slating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ot let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to gene\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been work
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when so
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 und accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sens\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
itive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

in? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for an eye, an ear, and a nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? Of course it does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer, and neurons comprising the brain.
