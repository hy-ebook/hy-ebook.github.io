\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism.

ack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the fin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues su\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ch as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spa\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
orks have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

as been variously defined throughout the ages. However, none of these numerous definitions have been enough to provide people with the real meaning of wisdom. This is because information seekers have not consulted an accurate source but tried to assess wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 dom by their own reasoning. As we mentioned previously, the source from which we can get information on wisdom is the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
an, as revealed by Allah, Who possesses infinite wisdom. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Anyone who fears Allah and obeys the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an is wise. However, most people ar\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e not aware that they can easily possess such a blessing. As they assume that wisdom is purely innate, they do not think it probable that they could acquire anymore than they already have. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, it is similar to a child believing that the world con\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sists only of his house, his classroom, his teacher, and his toys. Obviously, it is not possible for the child to leave his little world and see the whole world with a mature pair of eyes. That is why all his ideals, his worries, and his activities are re
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tricted to his own little world. Whereas, a mature adult, observing this child\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s life, can clearly see how restricted the child\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s world is. This is because the adult possesses the experience and knowledge that the world does not consist of just a house, a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 classroom, and a couple of toys. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, a similar comparison can be applied to wisdom. A person lacking wisdom assumes that he knows the truth about everything, that he is the wisest person, and lives the most wonderful life. As a result, he believes that he

One who has intelligence can recognize the superiority of someone who has wisdom and admire that person openly or secretly. He tries to imitate this wise person and to achieve the same superiorit\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y. But as he cannot appreciate that it is wisdom that gives him this uniqueness, he searches for the solution in the wrong place. He begins to observe this person\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

Also, wisdom is not limited to specific manners used only at certain times. On the contrary, it is a quality of perfection that changes according to circumstances, conditions and situations. The man of faith shows clear insight in situ

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  It is not possible for people who lack wisdom to imitate such perfection. They usually panic in situations they are experiencing for the first\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  time, they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

Another important quality wisdom brings with it is the ability to "analyse things". Anyone can recognize and make comments on any given thing. However, of where people of wisdom excel is in their recogn\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ition always being appropriate and their ability to see details which others cannot. The secret of this appropriateness and fine recognition ability is that believers use the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
an as their guide and use their wisdom toward its ends. The Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an is Allah\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  just book. As a consequence, people who obey the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
an will definitely tread the most righteous path. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This ability of wise people makes for superiority and ease in every part of their lives. Above all else, they can analyse in detail the character of th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e people they meet. As a result they can easily determine their friends and enemies. By taking the characters Allah introduces in the Qur'an as their guide, they can understand others\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 characters in a very short period. Moreover, their ability to realize \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t the outset which events are in their favour and take precautions accordingly is a great advantage to them. Also, it is those with wisdom who can appreciate the beauties of the people around them, the details of which generally go unappreciated and the s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 gns of wisdom they demonstrate. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important quality of wise people that merit attention, is that they do not need to make lengthy observations or gather detailed information before making correct assumptions. A wise person\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s chief quality is his abi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 lity to arrive at correct conclusions with as little evidence as is needed and in the briefest possible time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A wise person can determine whether a person is lying by his mannerisms at that time, by inconsistencies in his speech, by his efforts to explain\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the situation in detail, by his restless behaviour, and many other factors depending on the situation. A person lacking wisdom will fully trust a person who is lying and even talk about his honesty. Because of this, he can go into a partnership with the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ishonest person and suffer materially and spiritually as a consequence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason why people lacking wisdom draw wrong conclusions and make wrong decisions under the same circumstances is that they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t follow the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s teachings. Allah therefore dra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ws attention to the fact that only the wise can see and comprehend the examples given in the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an and reminds us that people who know and who don\hich\f0 \rquote

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another major mistake heedlessness brings about is for people to forget the reason for their creation and existence in this world. Such people become blind to the proofs of the existence of Allah Who has created them, and fal

One who believes these verses and comprehends that behind every incident there is a hidden motive and benefit for him, is one who has trust in Allah. Even if he faces a situation, which at first sight seems to his disadvantage, he knows that this will bri
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 has no faith in Allah forgets that Allah creates events in order to test him and so becomes totally distant from rationalism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can explain the great difference between these two people with an example. Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s say that a factory goes on fire and the owner\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of the factory forgets that this situation is controlled by Allah and doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think that there must be a benefit in this situation for him, so he begins to distrust Allah. And, one who doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t trust Allah cannot think straight or take the necessary preca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tions or in any other way, act sensibly. For example, not being calm and composed can cause the otherwise extinguishable fire to grow. He loses time by being panic and grief-stricken and making a fuss instead of putting out the fire, saving his property, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r calling the fire brigade. After the fire, instead of taking measures against future fires so that it won\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t ever happen again, he occupies himself with useless thoughts, such as "how and why did it happen, I wish it had not happened, or if I had done so-\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd-so it wouldn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One, who trusts Allah, never becomes hopeless or sad, even if he loses everything he has. This person knows that Allah can take away a blessing He gave and that He does this to test people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s trust in Him. With a clear con\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sciousness, he tries to take care of the damage as soon as possible and takes the most swift and sensible precautions. He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t waste his time in panicking, worrying, or losing hope. Furthermore, without losing any time after such an event, he tries to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ake up for the damage by taking the most effective precautions possible so that it will not recur. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When it comes to the property he has lost, because he knows that the only owner of wealth is Allah, he is peaceful and at ease. He trusts Allah with all his\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 heart and he prays for Him to give him more than what he has lost. And he is happy to know that he will be rewarded much more for his trust in Allah in the Hereafter.

on, many movies, novels, and poems are given a romantic edge and romanticists try to make people believe that romanticism has a unique charm. However, the effect this has on people is to block their minds and prevent them from thinking logically and in a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 alanced way. This is because, romanticism totally disfavours reason. It is a way of life that leads people to ignore realities, live in a fantasy world, and think emotionally instead of reasonably. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One who submits himself to his emotions rather than his r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eason, who allows his emotions to guide him, can neither think realistically nor act logically. Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

e the ability to reason has been lost as a result of not obeying Allah\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s commands. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The destruction that lies behind the suicides, drug abuse, assault, or murders that occupy a large portion of the global news media is caused by romanticism and by being ov\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er-emotional. People become so apt to ignore the path of reason that they can easily destroy their own or others\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 lives or property. All the reasons they give to justify themselves have emotional factors at the root. For example, there are people who beco\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e upset at a harmless joke and kill as a result. Or, there are students who cannot get into a university, even though they have studied for months, and who try to commit suicide. Such people as cannot break away from their ambitions and who are so averse 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o reasonable conduct that they cannot even see other opportunities ahead of them, can make such irrational decisions under the influence of their emotions and then act upon these decisions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Every step one takes under the influence of romanticism and with n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ture. Because they cannot appreciate the value of the means they have to hand, they cannot take sound precautions to prevent possible dangers. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us list some of the accidents and dangerous incidents that come about as a result of the imprudence of one w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ho doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use his mind:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A thoughtless person tries to figure out how to use new equipment by experimenting with it, instead of using the manual or learning from someone who is acquainted with it. He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t see anything wrong in the rough handling of frag\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ile parts or fiddling with buttons he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t know the use for on electronic items, such as a stereo set, or on a delicate device such as a computer. For this reason, he usually breaks brand new equipment without ever using it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t see any harm in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
giving a child small pieces of plastic, which he can swallow, to play with. He begins to think of the inappropriateness of this behaviour when the child starts choking and needs to be taken to the hospital. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A thoughtless person tries to carry furniture ma\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 de up of two or three pieces in one go and generally drops them all, half way. He cannot calculate that these need to be carried one by one.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A thoughtless person cannot imagine the damaging effect the sun will have on the human body. He harms his skin by s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
taying out in the sun for longer than necessary, and sometimes even for hours on end. Because of the sun, his skin begins to swell up and deep wounds appear on his skin. He becomes nauseated and has a headache. Although he experiences these troubles every
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 summer, he repeats the same mistake the next summer because he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t draw on his wisdom. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t see any harm in playing with stray cats or dogs, which may be diseased for all he knows. In fact, most cases of diseases, such as rabies are th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e result of such imprudence. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such a person is not sensitive to sudden smells or noises. He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t realize the significance of such things, even if he does realize it, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t pay attention to them, either because of his unconcerned nature or because h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e cannot think of the dangers that may ensue. However, his house could burn down or he could be poisoned, because he cannot sense danger in the smell of gas or he may be faced with a fire because he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t respond to the smell of burning in time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He injur\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
es himself by careless behaviour, such as plugging a wet plug into an outlet. He often suffers electric shocks because he changes the light bulb or does electronic repairs without shutting down the power.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He chops food very hastily with a very sharp knife.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Because he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t calculate the possible injury, he cuts his finger. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Because he empties the dishwater with wet hands, the plates slip from his hand. And because he attempts to pick up the broken pieces with his hands he cuts himself. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t hesitat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e to open the door to a stranger and even invite him in. As a result, he is assaulted or his house is burgled.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 By placing a hot pan on a glass table, he may cause it to crack. Or by placing a teapot on a wooden table he damages the surface. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When he is goi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng on a road trip, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t think to take preventative measures in case his car breaks down. Even if he does think of doing so, his arrangements are barely adequate. If he fills up the fuel tank, he forgets to take a spare tyre or check the water or the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oil in the car. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He leaves everything to the last minute. For example, even when he has to catch his plane, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t pack his luggage or run his errands till the last minute. Let\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s say his house is an hour away from the airport; he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t leave until th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ere are only twenty minutes left. Even if he leaves on time, because he hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t planned how to get there, he cannot find a cab or, even if he finds a cab, because he hasn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t foreseen a traffic jam, he loses time and misses his flight. He experiences such mi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 haps all the time, but he still doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t give up his indifference or think of wise precautions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When he is carrying things, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t think to remove anything that he could step on or bump into. He realizes his mistake only when he stumbles across obstacle\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s or when he bumps into something while he is carrying something heavy. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t see the danger in placing an object on the edge of a coffee table, or other such piece of furniture from which it can fall and break with the slightest impact.

Generally, people have a standard understanding of art and aesthetics. They apply the things they have learned from an early age throughout their lives. They apply whatever is thought to be fashionab\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 le at the time. But they don
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t apply their wisdom and try to produce something new. Their taste in art is completely based on imitation. Such people as are lacking in wisdom cannot come up with anything unique that they thought of themselves, even if they
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 achieve a certain technical success with the things they imitate. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 They especially use classical models in decorating their environment. We could make a list of the details of decorative styles people generally use.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As a thoughtless person doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use his \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
time wisely, it takes him months to redecorate his house. Even the painting and cleaning of a small house goes on for months on end. He cannot evolve ways of doing tasks practically and efficiently. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One who doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t apply his wisdom doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t have any specia\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
l interest in art or decoration; he can live without making any changes in his house for years. When he does eventually decide to make some changes, the first thing he thinks of is to change the fabric of the couches. He has no conception of moving the fu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 niture around or in any other way making his surroundings more pleasant. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even if he has a lot of opportunities, he cannot use them wisely. Even if he buys the most expensive, highest quality furniture, he cannot position it with any attempt at artistry. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even if he succeeds in decorating his living space pleasantly, he fails to make it a relaxed, comfortable, and a healthy place to live in at the same time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He cannot use his intelligence in the placing of his furniture. He places breakable, glass vases at\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  points where people can easily bump into them. Similarly, he doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t see any harm in using sharp and pointed objects as decorative pieces, and he places them where people can easily come into contact with them and hurt themselves. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 He cannot get rid of an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ything, even though he has too many things. He tries to use old and new items at the same time. With every new item he purchases, he crowds his house and his house becomes even gloomier. He cannot realize the confusion that is created and is himself not d

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The things we listed thus far are only a few examples of how lack of wisdom reflects on daily life. But obviously, it is not possible to limit the hardship and damage thoughtlessness causes to people. One, who shuts hi

s mind, will experience similar difficulties and hardship continuously till the end of his life. The only way to eliminate them, as has been explained from the beginning of the book, is to submit oneself to the clear mind with which religion rewards us. T

The conclusion that should be reached from all of this is that thoughtlessness is a great misfortune that leads a person into Hell. And Hell is a place of torment where it is not even possible to die and so escape from it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. This reality is definite enough and so much unbearable that no one may say, "Nothing will happen to me". The Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
an mentions in detail the unbelievers in Hell in which there is heavy sighing, whose skin is renewed every time it is burned off, and who ca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
not find anything other than boiling water and scalding pus when they are thirsty. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Furthermore, one who doesn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use his mind should start thinking of the blessings of Heaven he will be deprived of, too. Before unreasoning people face Hell, they will be aw\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 et on the hearts of thoughtless people. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These are the losses thoughtlessness brings in the Hereafter. People distanced from religion because of their thoughtlessness try to enjoy worldly blessings by abandoning the Hereafter. But they cannot achieve what 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they want here either. They suffer material and spiritual losses throughout their lives. Firstly, they are untrusting of Allah, which is brought about by not submitting to Allah and His decree, and as a result of this they live in a state of unease. They 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ead lives of continual worry about the future, fear of losing what they have, anxiety about becoming destitute, grief at separation from loved ones, and becoming humiliated in others\hich\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Because they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t live by the teachings of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an, they can \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
never be close friends with anyone in the real sense; they cannot comprehend the beauty of real love, respect, loyalty, and many other moral virtues. As they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t live according to the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
an, they experience the difficulties of an ignorant system. Regre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 constantly rules their lives; they are always complaining about what they did the day before or even an hour before and keep voicing their regret. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Because they don\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t use their reason they cannot speak well or wisely. They talk for hours but still can\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 t s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Without a doubt, if a person thinks that such a consequence is also possible in his own case, it will enable him to be fearful and apprehend many things while there is still time. If a person in this situation ends up in Hell, he will most likely
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

So, for a person to think, while he is still in this world, that he may face such a situation will result in his feeling deep regret there and then. In order not to say these words or words like these in Hellfire, he will decide to abide by his cons

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hat living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being fr

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, maggots developing in rott\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced a

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a gre\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molecule, which\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 50

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both de
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, how could these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifeti
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eir necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid11952870\charrsid15741197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Specie}{\f0\insrsid11952870\charrsid15741197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations", that is, genetic disorders. Yet, th

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

with an example so simple as to be understood even by children:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par }{\f0\insrsid11952870\charrsid15741197 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
all oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision". These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a serie
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to ach
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 arpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is fr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
om light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ever perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
us has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.
