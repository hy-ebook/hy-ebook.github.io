is theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation \endash  and therefore, God's existence \endash 
 over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore
 an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our books, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \bullet  All the author's
 books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn God's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning God's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The bo
o
ks' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are 
influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \bullet  This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \bullet 
 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others
, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par \bullet  We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \bullet 
 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that
 create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many book
s
 on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism 
and communism. 
\par His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their conte
nts. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disp
r
ove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the last word, so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his inte
ntion to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' fee
ble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Ital
ian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper i
nsights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ide
o
logy or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from the
ir very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as 
also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the 
sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cr
uelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that pe
ople can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twenty-first century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 Ever since time began, God's
 prophets and messengers have called people to the true path. Some people heeded this call and surrendered themselves to God, thus attaining an honorable life in this world and in the Hereafter. Others persisted in their unbelief, thus earning a troubled 
a
nd difficult life in this world and eternal suffering in the Hereafter. Just like the other prophets sent by God, Jesus (pbuh) commanded his society to worship God, the One and Only, and to live with the knowledge that they will have to account for themse
l
ves on the Day of Judgment, recommended that they live by moral values that please God, and called on them to avoid denial, polytheism, and evil in all of its forms. Those who rejected his call tried to pressure him and those who followed him to give up t
heir mission. For that reason, as has happened with many prophets and believers throughout history, they set traps for Jesus (pbuh). One of these was how they would kill him. 
\par However, with his unique birth and the miracles he performed, Jesus (pbuh) was on
e of God's blessed prophets. God laid out a specific destiny for him, and thus all of the unbelievers' traps came to nothing. The Qur'an reveals that Jesus' (pbuh) enemies failed to kill him, although they were made to think that they had. God raised Jesu
s (pbuh) to His presence while he was still alive. The Qur'an, as well as the words of our beloved Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), say that Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth, a great miracle indeed.
\par Those who maintain that Jesus (pbuh) was 
killed or is dead are making a serious mistake. One purpose in writing this book is to explain why this is so. In the following pages, we will examine the Qur'anic verses and the hadith of Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace) that reve
al the truth of this issue, which has confused so many people over the centuries. 
\par In addition, this book will remind the reader of two important tidings: Jesus' (pbuh) return to Earth and the signs that will precede this event. By God's will, his second co
ming has drawn near, and the world will witness great events when it becomes a reality. All sincere believers need to prepare for this miraculous period in the most appropriate way.
\par Before examining the proofs that Jesus (pbuh) is not dead and will return to Earth, we will clarify several important points.

sources, while others are referred to in a more indirect manner. This is part of God's testing of humanity.
\par The great Islamic scholar Bediuzzaman Said Nursi stressed this fact while explaining the signs of the End Times:

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 Religion is a test, an experience t
hat separates the superior from the inferior. Therefore, an event that will be seen by everyone in the future will be debated in such a way that it will neither be completely obscure, nor so evident that it will inevitably be accepted by everyone. It will
 
open the door to reason, but it will not do away with the possibility of choice. That is because if a sign of the Day of Judgment is seen in such a completely evident form that everyone is obliged to accept it, then a person with a coal-like predispositio
n will remain alongside a person with a diamond-like predisposition. As a result, the secret of God's charging humanity to act in compliance with His commands and prohibitions and the consequences of the test are lost.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

Times' signs may be that not everyone who sees them can immediately understand and interpret them. The fact that some of these signs have been described in an oblique manner may cause some people to have doubts. Yet these doubts are completely unfounded, 
for when such signs are analyzed with a clear and open mind, they can be understood. Moreover, commentaries by great Islamic scholars are valuable guides for believers.
\par People with true faith and the requisite fear of and respect for God also have, as a ble
ssing from our Lord, a deep understanding and comprehension. Thanks to this, they can accurately identify what is wrong and also understand, to the extent that God wills, that wisdom is often expressed in oblique terms. Such people will never feel any dou
b
t about what our Lord reveals and what our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) has reported. They will evaluate the relevant hadith and Qur'anic verses through the eyes of faith, and will seek to understand the information contained within the
m
. Rejecting wisdom-containing information just because one cannot understand it is unsuitable behavior for Muslims. Therefore, Muslims need to pray to our Lord in order to understand any wisdom that is unclear to them, remember that the End Times will be 
a most miraculous period, and prepare themselves for it in the most appropriate manner.

ms, submitted to Him"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
 (Qur'an, 3:84). Muslims know that all of God's prophets are chosen, honorable, and respected individuals in His sight. God created all of His messengers with superior moral values and perfect behavior so that they could serve as role m
odels for humanity. The prophets are His beloved servants. Many verses reveal that those who obey the prophets are actually obeying God, and that those who comply with God's prophets will be rewarded in this world and in the Hereafter. This devotion and o
bedience is shaped within that awareness. 
\par Beginning with the Companions of our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), it is a great source of honor for all believers who were the prophets' contemporaries to be with these blessed people. Being wit
h the prophets, who set an example for all people with their deep faith in God, superior moral values, sharp intellects, and determination and courage is one of the most valuable blessings in this world. Those who sincerely obeyed Abraham (pbuh); who had 
f
aith in Joseph (pbuh); who fought against Pharaoh alongside Moses (pbuh); and who followed such great individuals as Noah (pbuh), Solomon (pbuh), Salih (pbuh), Jacob (pbuh), and David (pbuh) have all received, by God's will, their rewards in the Hereafter
. Those believers who have never seen one of the prophets can still pray to be counted among their friends in the Hereafter and to live with them in Paradise for all eternity.
\par The End Times is a very blessed period, one of glad tidings for all believers who
 love and obey the prophets, for God has revealed that after a gap of 2,000 years, He will send Jesus (pbuh) back to Earth. This very important news is revealed both in the Qur'an and the hadith. All Muslims who feel a deep devotion to and love for the Pr
ophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) also love, respect, and honor Jesus (pbuh). In a hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah, our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) said:

Therefore, when he returns, Jesus (pbuh) will call people to this same divine religion: Islam. Indeed, the Qur'an reveals that Islam is the only religion of which God approves:}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\b\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067  "The religion with God is Islam"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067  (Qur'an, 3:19). When Jesus (pbuh) returns to E
arth, he will cleanse Christianity of its corrupted elements, rule the people according to the Qur'an (the last divine text), and bring all people together in Islamic moral values. 
\par Muslims will be this great prophet's sincerest supporters and defenders, f
or they have a deep love for him, just as they do for all of God's prophets. Given that Jesus (pbuh) is one of God's chosen servants, and because they take only God, His prophets, and true believers as their friends, all Muslims feel a deep respect for Je
sus (pbuh). The source of this deep love and devotion is a result of their love and fear of, and respect for God, as well as their obedience to Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace).

\par I swear to God, Who sent me as a true prophet, that of course Jesus (pbuh), son of Mary, will find in my community people to replace his disciples [when he returns close to the period of the End Times].}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 At a time when the signs of the se
cond coming are becoming clear, we need to think about the importance of the Prophet's (may God bless him and grant him peace) words. The fact that some people behave almost as if Jesus (pbuh) will not return, a grave mistake, must not be allowed to decei
v
e others or lead them to make concessions on the subject. On the contrary, Muslims who realize that this event is a manifest truth revealed by the Qur'an and the hadith must experience the excitement of this extraordinary situation and make great efforts 
t
o welcome this blessed guest with the appropriate amount of love and enthusiasm. There is no time to waste on groundless doubts and apprehensions. Believers must prepare both themselves and those around them for this miraculous event and use the opportuni
ties afforded by living in such a time to gain God's good approval. 
\par When Jesus (pbuh) returns in the End Times, he may ask: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "Who are my helpers?"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
 Those who aspire to be among his helpers must use this valuable period in which we are living to renounce and,
 from that point on, abandon all behavior and immorality that might be a source of shame when Jesus (pbuh) returns. The most important attitude to be avoided, and which might constitute the greatest source of shame, is a lack of enthusiasm in this area. G
i
ven this reality, believers should constantly raise the issue of what an extraordinary event the second coming will be. Explaining the proofs that Jesus (pbuh) was raised alive to God's presence and will return, along with describing all aspects of this e
v
ent's signs, will enable those who are still unconvinced to overcome their doubts. Moreover, constantly raising this issue will make it impossible for people to claim later on: "But we did not know. If we had known, we surely would have made the most suit
able preparations." Thus, believers should use all available means to join together in order to prepare for this event.

 (pbuh) himself. When he returns, his first action will be to cleanse Christianity of these distorted beliefs, for only he can do this. He will tell the Christian world, which is awaiting his coming, of Islam's moral values and direct Christianity in the 
direction of the true, divine religion. Those who follow him will be true Christians.

e who travels to all places," is described as a person who will appear in the End Times and who will be the source and representative of all evil and strife. However, the Antichrist may not actually be a human being; rather, this person may be a system or
 
an ideology that represents a way of thinking or practice that is against religious moral values. Many hadith contain a great deal of information about the Antichrist, and several verses refer to the Antichrist's morality and system. This individual's eme

The current state of the world shows us which subjects we need to give priority to as we prepare for this glorious event. This is a period when the damage inflicted on society by atheistic ideologies will perhaps be worse than in any other. The spr
ead of violence, terror, cruelty, fraud, falsehood, immorality, conflict, and poverty all over the world shows that the world is full of "wickedness." 
\par All of this cruelty and degeneration is gathering strength from the superstitious system established by 
those who deny God's existence and oneness and who do not believe in the Hereafter. Moreover, it is growing and spreading. In the face of this, Muslims need to eliminate the ideological sources that make up this environment's foundation and encourage this
 degeneration through intellectual arguments. One of the most important ways of doing this is for Muslims to struggle in a spirit of oneness and unity. 
\par This intellectual struggle is a major responsibility for all Muslims. In addition, those Muslims who are
 awaiting his return must abandon their internal disagreements and differences of opinion in order to establish unity and solidarity. No doubt, it would be a grave error and a terrible evil for the Muslim world to become mired in its own internal problems
.
\par Muslims who fully live by the Qur'an's moral values and follow the Sunnah of our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) must behave in a cohesive manner, bring a spirit of cooperative solidarity to the fore, and remind the Muslim world that all M
uslims are "brothers and sisters in religion." In fact, our Lord tells Muslims to act in a spirit of unity and union:

t the time of Jesus (pbuh), the Mediterranean region and the surrounding area was ruled by Rome. Roman religion, in common with the surrounding religions, was polytheistic and superstitious. The imaginary deities of Greek mythology also appeared in Roman

ciety, and the ensuing chaos could not be eliminated. As a result, Judaism moved away from the divine religion that God had revealed to Moses (pbuh) and was corrupted by the addition of many superstitious beliefs and laws.

\par While Jesus (pbuh) was among his people, only a very few people followed him. The Qur'an reveals that when his people persisted in their denial, he asked who would be his helpers:

One of the true believers' main characteristics is that they believe in concealed mysteries and obey the messengers unquestioningly. Such believers know that every word spoken by God's messengers is true, and so they trust them completely, fo
llow them, and love and respect them. As revealed in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 (Qur'an, 33:6), this devotion is superior to all other forms of love. Indeed, the devotion of the Prophet's (may God bless him and grant him
 peace) Companions and their protection of him during the wars against the pagans is a fine example of this. 
\par In addition to Roman pagan oppression and the hypocrisy of some polytheistic Jews, as well as the opposition of prominent Jews who pursued only th
eir own interests, the fact that Jesus (pbuh) had only a very few followers draws our attention to the difficult circumstances in which he found himself. However, it must be made clear that there is considerable wisdom in the fact that he struggled in suc
h
 difficult conditions. Jesus (pbuh) and those sincere, devout believers who followed him displayed great patience, by God's leave, in these trying circumstances and will receive their reward at every moment in His presence. Such climates are actually very
 
valuable, for they increase the believers' determination and mutual devotion, strengthen their faith, and reinforce their love of and devotion to God. Believers have faith that everything they experience happens because He wills it to, and thus sincerely 
accept everything that our Lord sends their way. Aware that God is their true friend and guide, all believers know that His religion will eventually triumph. 
\par God has promised that He will never allow those who deny Him to triumph over the believers. Theref
ore, the prophets and their followers will inevitably be victorious, for He states that the traps of those who set snares for the believers are doomed to failure:

eved in Jesus (pbuh) had to keep their faith secret, and many of those who declared their faith suffered severe punishment, torture, and, sometimes, even death. However, the unbelievers' greatest plot was, without a doubt, their attempt to kill Jesus (pbu
h
). A number of leading Jews collaborated with the Roman pagans, and, with the support of various hypocrites, devised a plan. Each stage was planned down to the finest detail, and they were convinced that it would succeed. However, their plan was disrupted
 in a most unexpected way: They imagined that they had killed Jesus (pbuh), but in reality, God raised him to His presence and protected His prophet from their snares and deceptions. By means of this miracle, their plan failed.
\par Here, it is appropriate to me
ntion a most important matter. As we have seen, so-called Jewish religious leaders plotted against Jesus (pbuh). Acting out of a concern for their position and interests, they received the support of a number of influential Jews. These people then collabo

ated with the Roman pagans and planned Jesus' (pbuh) death. Although their plan failed, the way that they sought to kill this most honorable and superior prophet, one who called upon them to live by the moral values of the divine religion, was a terrible 
c
rime. Furthermore, they also committed the crime of murder by killing someone who resembled Jesus (pbuh). However, this crime belongs solely to those who were actually guilty of it, and there is no doubt that they will be duly recompensed for their action
s in the Hereafter. In other words, it is a serious mistake to hold all Jews, regardless of time or place, responsible for the crime of a few individual Jews.

be just and modest, and that the prophets were chosen and immaculate messengers in His presence. As a result, these people set traps for the prophets. This mentality is described, as follows:

\par Qur'an 3:55 and Qur'an 4:157-58 head the list of those verses that rel
ate how Jesus (pbuh) was not killed but was raised alive to God's presence. When these verses are examined word by word, this most important truth is clearly revealed. Another truth is also indicated: Jesus (pbuh), who now lives in God's presence, will re
turn to Earth during the End Times. This fact will be examined in later sections of this book.
\par Qur'an 3:55 informs believers that God will "take back" Jesus (pbuh), protect him from the unbelievers, and raise him to His presence. Many great Islamic scholars
 and commentators have interpreted this verse to mean that Jesus (pbuh) did not die. As the verse states:

 rather to a sleeping person's soul being "taken." Ibn Kathir, the famous Islamic scholar and commentator, used this hadith, along with many other proofs in his commentary on}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

to sleep and then raised to God's presence. Jesus (pbuh) did not die, but was merely removed from this dimension by His will. (God knows best.)

t
he intended victim has actually been killed or not. Alternatively, there needs to be very exceptional circumstances for there to be any doubt about whether someone condemned to death has actually died. If there is doubt, something out of the ordinary must
 
have occurred. Those who had sought to kill Jesus (pbuh) would have felt no doubt as to whether they had succeeded or not. However, our Lord reveals that they did have such doubts, were only speculating, and had no certain information. This is one of the 
proofs that Jesus (pbuh) did not die but was raised alive to God's presence.

 of knowledge. In this way, God has indicated the raising of Jesus (pbuh) and that no matter how impossible this may seem to a person, it is not impossible relative to His might and wisdom. A similar situation can be seen in the verse: "Glory be to Him, W
ho took His servant on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque [Masjid al-Haram] to the Further Mosque [Masjid al-Aqsa]\'85
" (Qur'an, 17:1). That is because no matter how much such a journey may be impossible relative to the power of Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace), it is a most easy matter relative to the might of God.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

d the Islamic scholars' comments, Jesus (pbuh) was raised alive, with his body, to God's presence. This is a miracle of God, and a wonder that will inspire great enthusiasm and excitement among all believers. Claims that only his soul was raised to His pr
esence, or that his ascension was only spiritual (in station), do not reflect the facts. The invalidity of such claims has been proven by many Islamic scholars, some examples of which have been cited above.

es after it must have a meaning that is completely opposite to the preceding statement. That being the case, it is likely that the verses referring to Jesus (pbuh) }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "\'85

s "on the contrary," comes after a sentence expressing a negativity, then, according to the rules of Arabic linguistics, the sentence following it must mean the exact opposite of the one preceding it. The opposite of death is life. This is a requirement o
f
 the rules of linguistics. If we say that "the ascension here is a spiritual one" and "Jesus (pbuh) died in the normal sense," then we are violating that rule. In that case, the ascension following the expression "on the contrary" would not represent the 
o
pposite to the verbs of "killing" and "crucifying" in the negative sentence preceding it. That is because it may be possible for a person to be killed and for his or her soul to rise to the skies. Otherwise, this term would be meaningless, and there are n
o meaningless terms in the Qur'an \'85 According to those who support the thesis that the ascension is only one of the soul, the meaning of the verse is this: "They did not kill him and did not crucify him \'85
 on the contrary, God raised his station." There is no particular oratory here, let alone succinctness \'85
 No rational person could take the words "The elevator in my building raises me to the fourth floor every day," to mean that I am only raised to the fourth floor in spirit. Therefore, neither was Jesus (pbuh) raised only in spirit.}{\rtlch\fcs1

Contrary to what some people maintain, the ascension is not a spiritual one or one of degree. God reveals that He foiled the trap set for Jesus (pbuh). Thus, given the fact that J

-Kawthari expounds on this by giving the following example:

r than: "He raises your station before people." Our Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) was attacked physically, and so God placed him under His physical protection. This also applies to Jesus (pbuh), who was physically attacked as well. There
fore, it is impossible for the ascension referred to in the verse to have been merely a spiritual one.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\up6\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 49}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

live and will return to Earth when God wills. (God knows best.) No doubt, this is a most important news for sincere believers. The fact that such a blessed prophet will return to Earth is a miraculous situation and a source of great enthusiasm for all bel
ievers who will witness this miracle.

ng "being clean." Islamic scholars regard this word as one proof that Jesus (pbuh) was raised alive to God. According to them, the interpretation of the verse is: "I am taking you, raising you to Me, and }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 removing you from this environment polluted by unbelievers and sinners.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 Thus, God purified Jesus (pbuh) from the unbelievers, the unbelievers' plot to kill him was foiled and they failed to achieve their goal. (God knows best.)
\par Moreover, this verse also shows that Jesus (pbuh) was purified by his physica
l separation from an environment containing unbelievers. (God knows best.) Thus, the assertion that Jesus (pbuh) died and that only his soul was raised to God is proven false. A spirit-only ascent would mean that he was not purified. 
\par In order for Jesus (p
buh) to have been purified in the manner revealed in the verse, he would have to have departed from his surrounding environment in both body and soul. Furthermore, a spirit-only purification cannot apply to a prophet with superior moral values, one who is
 honored in God's presence and has deep faith, such as Jesus (pbuh). Another verse reveals his superior moral values: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067

ssenger of God, Jesus' (pbuh) soul is immaculate. However, his environment was not immaculate, due to the unbelievers' irreligious behavior and corrupt moral values. Indeed, our Lord reveals that they were unclean because of their moral corruption:

The Qur'an refers to Jesus' (pbuh) miraculous birth, his message to and struggle against his unbelieving society, his miracles, and his disciples. It also reveals that he will return to Earth near the Day of Judgment. We have already looked in some detail
 at 3:55 and 4:157-58, which indicate, according to their lexical meanings and the interpretations of the vast majority of Islamic scholars and commentators, that Jesus (pbuh) did not die. This evidence can be listed, as follows:

h was given to Moses (pbuh), that Pages were given to Abraham (pbuh), and that the Book of Psalms was given to David (pbuh). If there were books revealed before the prophets' own time, the Qur'an states that they knew them. However, only in the case of Je
s
us does the Qur'an state that a prophet will be taught a book that was revealed after his own time. This is one of the indications that he will return to Earth and that when he does so, he will rule with the book revealed after his lifetime: the Qur'an. (

il the Day of Resurrection. The number of his followers during his lifetime was very small, and the message that he brought underwent a rapid degeneration after his ascension to God. Throughout the next two centuries, his followers, who came to be known a
s Christians, were subjected to severe persecution and had no political power. Therefore, it is out of the question to say that the Christians living at the time were superior to the unbelievers and that they are the ones being referred to in this verse.

\par Ov
er the intervening centuries, Christianity moved away from its essence and turned into a different religion. Christians adopted two mistaken beliefs: Jesus (pbuh) was the son of God (God is surely beyond that.) and the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and th
e Holy Ghost [or Holy Spirit]). Given this, we cannot regard present-day Christians as those who will follow Jesus (pbuh) in the End Times, because God reveals in several verses that those who believe in the Trinity are actually unbelievers:

 only in the case of Jesus (pbuh). Moreover, the Qur'an does not use such an expression for any prophet who came before Jesus (pbuh) and in whom
 the People of the Book believed. No similar account is offered with regard to Abraham (pbuh), Solomon (pbuh), David (pbuh), Moses (pbuh), Joseph (pbuh), or Jacob (pbuh).
\par If every member of the People of the Book were to believe in Jesus (pbuh) before his 
or her own death, then a similar case would have been revealed with regard to the other prophets who were sent to them. However, this expression is employed only in relation to Jesus (pbuh). Therefore, it is another important proof that Jesus (pbuh) diffe
rs from other prophets. (God knows best.)
\par As we have seen, the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 his}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067  in the expression }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 is evidently Jesus (pbuh). It is impossible to interpret the verse, as some people have, in a way that indicates that "Each member of the People of the Boo
k will believe in Jesus (pbuh) before they die." The Jews, a People of the Book, tried to kill Jesus (pbuh) because they did not believe in him. They later continued in their unbelief and believed that they had killed him.
\par In the light of all this, we can 
understand the following from this verse: Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth and, like every other human being, will live and die. When he returns, all of the People of the Book will see and know him, and will obey him while he lives. Jesus (pbuh) will bea
r
 witness to this in the Hereafter. (God knows best.) The great majority of Islamic scholars share this view. Abu Hurayrah and Ibn `Abbas, both of whom were Companions of the Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), also stated that this verse indi
cates his second coming. Al-Qurtubi interprets the verse in the following terms:

The Qur'an and hadith reveal that Jesus (pbuh) did not die but was raised to God's presence. The Christians also believe this; however, their belief contradicts the Qur'an. In addition, some Muslims also have the mistaken ideas that Jesus (pbuh) died and 
will not return. Such a claim is completely unfounded and, as our Lord states, those who make it are only guessing. God tells all believers not to speculate on matters of which they have no knowledge:

Some people may be taken in by this erroneous belief, because they fail to fully consider what it means to make or believe such a claim. Or, they may be unaware of the responsibility that thi
s will place on them. We do not seek to disparage such people; rather, our goal is to show them their mistake so that they will abandon it. But before they can be made to realize what a great error they are making, they need to consider just what that cla
im implies. In the Qur'an, God reveals that He confounded the unbelievers' plots against Jesus (pbuh) and that they did not kill him. It is a grave responsibility to ignore a truth revealed as clearly as in the words: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 
\ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "\'85 they did not kill him and they did not crucify him}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
" (Qur'an, 4:157). In essence, believing that Jesus (pbuh) was killed means that the unbelievers' plot succeeded, which contradicts the Qur'an.
\par Some people say that Jesus (pbuh) was not killed but died when his appointed hour came. That is al
so untrue. According to this error, God took Jesus' (pbuh) soul before the unbelievers could lay their hands on him, and therefore he was not killed by them. Yet the relevant verses clearly demonstrate that this is not the case. Moreover, such logic is fl
a
wed. Consider the following analogy: Three people have conspired to kill an enemy in an ambush. Let us further assume that the person in question dies of a heart attack before reaching the ambush site. In such a case, those who set the ambush will presuma
bly rejoice in the belief that they have achieved their objective. 
\par Alternatively, consider the case of someone who goes to an enemy's home to kill him. However, he falls to his death from the balcony rather than as t
he result of a punch during the fight. The fact that the person in question has died means that his antagonist has attained his objective. A similar analogy can be imagined in the case of Jesus (pbuh). The unbelievers set a trap designed to kill him. Yet 
G
od reveals that He foiled that trap. If Jesus (pbuh) were to die anyway, this would mean that the unbelievers succeeded, which is not possible. Therefore, he is still alive, will come again at God's command, and will make religious moral values prevail ov
er the whole world. In effect, he will die only after he has returned to Earth and lived until he reaches old age. (God knows best.)
\par Still other people maintain that Jesus (pbuh) was saved from the unbelievers' trap but then died at an unknown time. Not onl
y does this claim lack any logical foundation, it also raises a number of unanswered questions to which these people offer no logical explanation. God caused Jesus (pbuh) to disappear suddenly while he was still alive. After this, nobody saw or spoke to h
i
m ever again. This is an extraordinary situation. If, as these people maintain, Jesus (pbuh) had lived for a while longer, surely some people would have seen him or spoken to him. Yet we have no such information that such a thing actually happened. Of cou
rse, it would have been impossible for him to have lived without moving among the people, speaking to anyone, or communicating his message, for doing so was the sole reason for his creation and being sent to the Children of Israel.
\par As mentioned earlier, this situation is unique to Jesus (pbuh). The word }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 tawaffaa}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
 is used only to describe his death. In addition, no other prophet was taught the three divine books: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "I taught you the Book and Wisdom, and the Torah and the Gospel" }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 (Qur'an, 5:110) or has been described as: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "He is a Sign of the Hour"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 
\ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
 (Qur'an, 43:61). Only Jesus (pbuh) was raised to God's presence while still alive, only his followers will be superior until the Day of Judgment, and only in his case will all members of the People of the Book believe in
 him before he dies. All of this is an important proof that God has approved a very special destiny for Jesus (pbuh), and that to fulfill his destiny Jesus (pbuh) must be alive in His presence and return to Earth. (God knows best.)
\par God's confounding of the
 unbelievers' plot against Jesus (pbuh) and raising him while still alive, in both body and soul, to His presence is a great miracle. Throughout history, God has supported the prophets with various miracles. He revealed the true book, the Qur'an, to Proph
e
t Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace). Furthermore, Prophet Muhammad's (may God bless him and grant him peace) transport from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque in a single night (Qur'an, 17:1) and his prediction that the believers woul
d
 enter the Sacred Mosque in safety (Qur'an, 48:27) are some of his miracles. The way that Moses' (pbuh) staff turned into a snake and confounded the illusions of Pharaoh's magicians, the way that his hand appeared snow-white to onlookers, and the way that
 
the Red Sea divided in front of Moses (pbuh) and his people as they were being pursued by Pharaoh and his army; the way that Jesus (pbuh) came into the world without a father, spoke to people while he was still in his cradle, raised the dead, and cured le
pers; and the way that the fire was cooled when Abraham (pbuh) was cast into it are other miracles performed with God's approval. 
\par The faithful believe in these miracles performed by our Lord, and these miracles increase their joy in belief. Just as one of 
the faithful believes in all of the prophets' miracles, including those wrought by Jesus (pbuh), by the will of God, that person must also believe that Jesus (pbuh) was miraculously raised to His presence. 
\par In addition, those who claim that Jesus (pbuh) ha
s already died have to bear in mind the loss they will suffer when Jesus (pbuh) does return. Many of the signs regarding this event, as revealed in the Qur'an and the hadith, have already occurred. It is also great news that his second coming is at hand. 
(
God knows best.) That being the case, believers need to experience the excitement, enthusiasm, and joy of that event, and to compete with one another to make the best possible preparations to greet him. Therefore, those who have become caught up in this e
rroneous belief that Jesus (pbuh) has already died need to abandon their preconceptions, listen to their consciences, and again study in detail what the Qur'an has to say. Only by doing so will they see the truth and be freed from their error. 
\par Nevertheless, it will be useful to examine these mistaken claims once again to see their groundless nature so that those who have been taken in can acquire accurate information.

\par 1. The term }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 took me back}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067

ople. While asleep, people do not die in the normally accepted sense; the soul merely leaves the body for a different dimension for a brief period of time. If this is considered biological death, then Jesus (pbuh) died every night of his lifetime. Moreove
r, this would be true of all people. Clearly, the verse is not saying this.

 is used in the sense of sleep. Therefore, the verse means: "I shall cause you to sleep." In conclusion, we can say that Jesus (pbuh) was pl
aced in a state similar to sleep, was raised to God's presence while alive, and that he merely departed from this dimension. (God knows best.)

 The conversation with Jesus (pbuh) will take place with our Lord in the Hereafter, after he has come to Earth for a second time and then died.
\par Christians have fallen into serious error by deifying Jesus (pbuh). (God is surely beyond that.) Those who adher
e to this error will have to give an account in God's presence on the Day of Judgment. According to the Qur'an, Jesus (pbuh) will bear witness that they turned away from the true religion, because, like all other prophets, he called his society to believe
 in God as the one and only and to serve only Him. Qur'an 5:119 says that this event will occur in the Hereafter, which means that it refers to the Day of Judgment, as revealed in the above verses. The sentence }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 claim that Jesus (pbuh) died in the past. Thus, this verse cannot be used as evidence that Jesus (pbuh) has already died.
\par As stated earlier, the great majority of Islamic scholars agree that these verses refer to Jesus' (pbuh) ascension to God's presence. For instance, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi said that the verse means "Jesus' (pbuh) raising to the sky."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

k
y in physical form, which then leads them to deny his ascension to God's presence. But this is a most mistaken view. First and foremost, the intention behind raising Jesus (pbuh) to His presence was not so that he could live physically in the heavens, but
 to take him to a separate dimension, one independent of time and space. (God knows best.)
\par Human beings inhabit a dimension bounded by time and space and can only perceive and understand events within that dimension, as far as God permits and in the manner 
desired by Him. However, many verses reveal that there are other dimensions of which we know nothing, such as that inhabited by angels and jinns. With our Lord's approval, angels and jinns can cross from their own dimension to ours. An examination of the 
relevant verses will clarify this matter for us.

 to God's presence because they fail to understand the essence of this event should, necessarily, also doubt the existence of this dimension. Yet there is no evidence to provoke such doubt. On the other hand, there is a clear proof that, just like martyrs

 angels, and jinns, Jesus (pbuh) inhabits a dimension about which we know nothing, and that he will return to Earth when God wills. God raised Jesus (pbuh) to His presence, and, when the time established by God comes, he will return to this dimension, whi

When the angels return to His presence, this does not mean that they cease to exist, in the terms that apply in this world. They merely move to another dimension and continue living beyond our understanding. Similarly
, the fact that Jesus (pbuh) was raised to God's presence does not mean that he has died. Many verses and hadith confirm the truth of this interpretation. Jesus (pbuh) is alive in a dimension that surpasses our understanding. Moreover, the fact that angel
s
 cross between two dimensions, as God wills, shows that this transition is very easy when our Lord so wills. When the time set forth by God comes, Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth and call people to religious moral values as the messenger of God. (God kn
ows best.) 
\par All of this evidence indicates that those people who deny that Jesus (pbuh) is still alive and will return fail to appreciate God's power and might. Given that God, the All-Mighty and All-Powerful, is sovereign over all things, He creates as He 
wills and has infinite knowledge, whereas all human knowledge is limited to that which God permits humanity to have. A human being can only comprehend an event, how it takes place and the wisdom behind it, to the extent permitted by God. The fact that Jes
u
s (pbuh) was purified of the unbelievers and raised to God's presence may be one of those events that people cannot fully comprehend. A great miracle took place when the unbelievers came to kill Jesus (pbuh). Miracles are marvels that strengthen the belie
v
ers' faith and cause some unbelievers to turn to faith. After they see a miracle, believers turn to God and appreciate His infinite might. Their awed respect and sincere love for God is reinforced, and their enthusiasm and excitement grow. The way that Je
s
us (pbuh) was protected from the unbelievers' traps and departed from this dimension in both body and soul is one of these miracles. When the time appointed by God comes, another great miracle will take place: Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth. This fact 
has been imparted in verses and hadith, and is a marvel that all believers need to ponder.

God protected and rescued Jesus (pbuh) from the unbelievers' traps. The great majority of Islamic scholars agree with this interpretation. Moreover, the fact that Jesus (pbuh) did not die and was raised to God's presence does not mean that he is immortal.
 
Furthermore, such a mistaken idea is never proposed when dealing with his second coming. All of the evidence focuses on the facts that Jesus (pbuh) has not died yet, that he will return to Earth, and that his death will take place after that. (God knows b

Some people suggest that because Christians believe that Jesus (pbuh) is not dead and that he will return to Earth, Muslims should not believe such mistaken claims. However, their logic is seriously flawed.
\par First, it needs to be made clear that Judaism and
 Christianity were corrupted over the course of time, and that superstitions and errors entered into them. In addition, a close examination of the Old and New Testaments reveals that a number of beliefs and moral values belonging to the true religion have
 
been preserved. In addition, both books have several aspects in common with the Qur'an. Thus, we can establish which beliefs have been corrupted and which are compatible with the true religion by taking the Qur'an and the Sunnah of our Prophet (may God bl
ess him and grant him peace) as our guides.
\par The Qur'an, the last divine book revealed by God, turned people toward the true path and away from their misguided beliefs. In fact, the Qur'an enabled the Christians and the Jews, who had become divided from each
 other before its revelation, were given true and divine information on these subjects. Several verses reveal this truth, as follows:

The Christian belief that Jesus (pbuh) is not dead and will return is fully present in the Qur'an, which also reveals which aspects of Christianity are superstitious and which are divine. Christians make several errors wit
h regard to Jesus' (pbuh) ascension, due to such corrupt beliefs as the Trinity and Jesus' (pbuh) so-called status as God's son. In addition, their beliefs that he died to atone for the sins of all humanity and that he ascended to God's presence after dyi
n
g on the Cross are incompatible with the true religion. God reveals in the Qur'an that nobody can atone for the sins of another, for every individual's deeds are his or hers alone. Every person will be called to account on the Day of Judgment alone, and n
obody will be able to help anyone else, unless God wills it. This is revealed in the following verse:

e called upon them to serve God alone and to live the kind of lives that would meet with His good approval and warned them against the sufferings of the Day of Judgment. Like all other people, he could only do what God willed him to do. As revealed in the
 verse that reports Abraham's (pbuh) prayer, God }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
"gives me food and gives me drink; and when I am ill, He heals me; He will cause my death, then give me life; He Who I sincerely hope will forgive my mistakes on the Day of Reckoning"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

\par However, the Qur'an confirms their belief in the second coming. If they had corrupted this belief, there is no doubt that the Qu
r'an would have rectified this mistake, just as it rectifies all of the corrupted beliefs and concepts that have entered Christianity with respect to this great prophet. In conclusion, the unbelievers did not kill Jesus (pbuh), for God raised him to His p
resence. Both Christians and Muslims are waiting for his return. Until that time, he continues to live in a dimension that is unbounded by time and space and the nature of which is known only to our Lord.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 One of the claims made by those who are unwilling to accept the second coming is that "Believing in Jesus' (pbuh) return means accepting Christianity." 
\par This error is the product of mistaken and distorted logic. Jesus (pbuh) is a praised, selected, and unique prophet in God'
s presence. His superior moral values and deep faith are remembered with respect by all believers, who have adopted him as a role model. Praising his moral values, feeling intense excitement at his impending return, and telling all believers of these glad
 tidings are examples of a proper attitude. Making irrational and illogical excuses, such as the one given above, is unacceptable. 
\par According to this distorted logic, nothing regarding Christianity should ever be mentioned or discussed. In the same way, Mos
es' (pbuh) correct moral values and exemplary life should never be described, on the grounds that this would mean supporting the Jews. Many Qur'anic verses praise Jesus (pbuh), Moses (pbuh), Joseph (pbuh), Abraham (pbuh), and Jacob (pbuh), as well as thei
r
 deep faith. Yet according to this mistaken logic, these verses should never be read. These excuses are clearly unacceptable. As we made clear earlier, the People of the Book have several corrupted beliefs and practices that are incompatible with the true
 
religion. These are revealed in the Qur'an, as is the fact that followers of both religions have good and pleasing aspects and beliefs that are compatible with the true religion. Our responsibility is to consider the People of the Book in the light of the
 Qur'an and the Sunnah, and to distinguish between truth and error with the information that we obtain from these sources. 
\par In addition, we must remember that Muslims make no distinction among the prophets and that they hold these people in great respect: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 "
We believe in God and what has been sent down to us; what was sent down to Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes; what Moses and Jesus were given; and what all the prophets were given by their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of th
em. We are Muslims submitted to Him" }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
(Qur'an, 2:136). The fact that Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth before the Day of Judgment is not a subject that believers should refrain from discussing on the grounds of irrational and illogical pretexts. On the contr
ary, it is a glad tiding that should be constantly borne in mind with great enthusiasm, passion, and joy.
\par Another fact reveals these people's error: When Jesus (pbuh) returns, he will rule with the Qur'an. Like all of the other prophets, Jesus (pbuh) is a 
follower of Islam, the true and divine religion in God's presence. The Qur'an reveals these facts in the following verses:

Another unfounded assertion made by some people is that "Since Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace) was the last prophet, Jesus (pbuh) will not return." This has no basis in fact. First, it need

\ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 (Qur'an, 33:40). The fact that Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth does not, as some people maintain, change that fact. J
esus (pbuh) will return not as a prophet, but as a messenger who will maintain the law of Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace) and cause religious moral values to prevail worldwide.
\par Other people put forward another irrational and illogi
cal claim: "If Jesus (pbuh) is not to return as a prophet, then his coming will have no meaning." This violates both reason and conscience. Our Lord has promised this event, behind which He has placed great wisdom. Throughout history, God has shown people
 
the true path through the prophets that He has sent to them. Sometimes, during periods when people had turned away from religious moral values and degeneracy had become widespread, He removed people from the darkness of their errors by sending them messen
gers. These messengers are people sent by God as rulers, who have led people to salvation. Indeed, the Qur'an reveals that people suffering woes and difficulties have prayed to God to send them a savior and protector:

es to prevail, and not Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace)?" Taking these concerns as a pretext, they then raise all sorts of objections.
\par Our beloved Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace) is an honored and trustworth
y messenger in God's sight. God revealed His last Book to this great man, who is a role model of abiding by proper moral values, godliness and closeness to God, a friend of God, and one superior in His sight. He is also the friend, and protector of all be
l
ievers. Throughout his life, the Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace) waged an exemplary struggle in the path of God and enlightened Arabia, which was buried in spiritual darkness and ignorance, with Islamic moral values. When the time appointe
d by God came to an end, his life, like that of many other prophets, came to an end. 
\par However, God ordained a different destiny for Jesus (pbuh) and promised him that he would return to Earth. This is our Lord's discretion, and surely there is great wisdom 
behind it. One element of that wisdom (God knows best) is that only such a miracle will enable Christians and Jews to rescue themselves from the situation in which they find themselves. Christians have many superstitions and distorted dogmas, which the Mu
s
lims do not have, such as deifying Jesus (pbuh). Thus, Jesus' (pbuh) second coming is of great importance, for it will enable Christianity to rid itself of such distorted beliefs and turn to the true religious moral values of Islam. Although some Christia
n
s abide by the true path once they have seen it, others regard this as a betrayal of Jesus (pbuh) and so avoid living by true religious moral values. The fact is, however, that Jesus' (pbuh) return and spreading of the message of the true religion among p
e
ople will make it easier for these people to turn to Islam in a more rapid fashion. When their own prophet tells them that some of their beliefs (e.g., the Trinity and Jesus' [pbuh] atonement for humanity's sins) are mistaken, that God is the only deity a
nd that the Qur'an really is God's final revelation to humanity, Christians will sit up and listen to him. This event will free them from ascribing partners to God and other corrupt beliefs, and they will enter Islam in great waves. 
\par Remember that God has p
romised the believers that religious moral values will prevail on Earth. However, this will happen only if believers totally avoid all forms of polytheism, whether direct or indirect, turn only to God, and worship only Him. By the will of God, the second 
coming will represent the start of this auspicious time.

 He would be sending another messenger at a later date. Alternatively, this revelation should have encouraged the people living at the time to engage in idleness and apathy. However, there is great wisdom in our Lord's giving glad tidings to people by mea
n
s of a messenger, and, with God's permission, true believers will never be idle or apathetic. Believers have deep understanding and reason, both of which stem from faith. Therefore, they comprehend the importance of a messenger's tidings, experience the e
xcitement and enthusiasm of those tidings, and act in the awareness of the need to prepare themselves as much as possible for this great event. 
\par Those who maintain that Jesus (pbuh) is dead are making a false claim. In addition, the interpretations they pre
sent to prove their assertions do not reflect the truth. Our hope is that this book will help all of these misguided people realize their errors and abandon them. Such a moral value is a feature of believers and is praised in the Qur'an.
\par In the Qur'an, God
 reveals that the believers do not knowingly persist in error (Qur'an, 3:135) and abide by the true path once they see it. The best and most accurate information on this subject, as is the case with all matters, is that revealed in the Qur'an and the hadi
t
h. In other words, Jesus (pbuh) is not dead and was not killed. He will return to Earth when the appointed time comes. Therefore, instead of seeking to ignore or deny this clear truth by using groundless and flimsy interpretations, people should consider 
just what his return will mean and be excited and stimulated by it. True believers can pray to witness this great event and to experience the environment of beauty and auspiciousness that will ensue.

buh) is alive in God's presence and that he will come again. Islamic scholars agree that it is impossible to maintain any other position. For instance, Ibn Hazm emphasized that: "Anyone who says that Jesus (pbuh) was killed will either be someone who leav

reinforces believers' enthusiasm and determination. The increasing urgency with which preparations for this event need to be made can be seen in a number of events that are occurring now. As the Qur'an and hadith reveal, we may expect this event to take p
l
ace in the near future. The present period is one in which many signs of his second coming, the End Times, and the Last Day are taking place. Dozens of such signs have occurred, and, what is more, one after the other, just as revealed in the hadith. The w
a
ters of the Euphrates river were cut off, there was a major war between two Muslim nations, extraordinary events occurred in the skies, solar and lunar eclipses happened during the month of Ramadan, natural disasters are on the rise, major catastrophes th
at have killed many people have taken place, and moral degeneration and corruption have spread all over the world. (See www.jesuswillreturn.com for the 138 signs of Jesus' [pbuh] second coming).
\par The fact that all of these phenomena are taking place within a
 very short period, an even shorter period than that predicted by many people, indicates that even more historic and portentous events will occur. By God's leave, humanity will witness the coming of Jesus (pbuh) at some not-too-distant point. There is no 
d
oubt that even the possibility of witnessing this miracle, one of the greatest marvels in human history, is an extraordinary situation. If God permits, many people who read this book will witness this age and meet Jesus (pbuh). Therefore, it is essential 
t
hat all believers accelerate their preparations for this great event and ignore anything that might hinder their preparations. When Jesus (pbuh) comes, all Muslims must be in a spirit of union and togetherness, as a requirement of Islamic moral values. Th
e
y must strive to intellectually eliminate all atheistic ideologies, disseminate Islamic moral values to the greatest extent possible, and call people to the truth in the finest manner. They must ready themselves so that they can be his most effective supp
o
rters in his struggle against the Antichrist. It is a great honor for Muslims to be among those who strive to make the best possible preparations for such a chosen, honorable, and worthy guest. All believers now living have the possibility of achieving th
at honor, and everyone is responsible for making the best use of this opportunity, for Jesus (pbuh) may arrive very quickly and unexpectedly. 
\par Many people may wonder what kind of environment there will be when Jesus (pbuh) returns. The hadith provide a grea
t deal of information about this. First, Jesus (pbuh) will slay the Antichrist and end his corrupt system. He will call all people to live according to Islam's guidance and teachings. After the Antichrist's system has been eliminated, people will turn in 
d
roves to live by religious moral values. As a result, spiritual and material peace and comfort will blossom and spread. All conflicts and fighting will end, and disagreements will be resolved by peaceful means. Tensions and fears stemming from moral degen
e

as religious moral values will be fully implemented, the finest works of art ever known will be produced and there will be stupendous advances in science and technology. Wherever people may go in the world, they will encounter beauty, wealth, and abundanc

 important subject we wish to consider is how believers will recognize Jesus (pbuh) when he returns. This is essential, because false Messiahs will also appear. Some people hesitate to raise the matter of Jesus' (pbuh) return out of a mistaken belief that
 this will prepare the way for false Messiahs. In reality, the appearance of such imposters is a major sign of the second coming. (See Harun Yahya, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
The Signs of Jesus' [pbuh] Second Coming}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 ). More importantly, everything he does after his return will be wise
 and inimitable, and such acts will distinguish him from all other people. One of the clearest proofs that the other "Messiahs" are false is the way they seek to prove themselves. 
\par Another major feature that distinguishes Jesus (pbuh) from false Messiahs i
s that he will have no relatives, and that no person will be familiar with his physical features, countenance, or tone of voice. No one will be able to claim: "I knew him before, I saw him at such and such a time, his family and relatives are so and so," 
s
ince everyone who knew him died many centuries ago. Mary, Zechariah, the Disciples who spent years with him, the leading Jews of his time, and those who received the message from him in person are all dead and gone. Therefore, Jesus (pbuh) will be complet
ely unknown to the general public. 
\par This will eliminate the danger of false Messiahs. On Jesus' (
pbuh) return, no situation will arise to cause people to doubt who he really is. Nobody will have any reason to say: "This person cannot be Jesus (pbuh)," for he will return to Earth in the same state, wearing the same clothes as when he was raised to God
's presence, and will possess superior features that nobody will be able to imitate. (God knows best.)
\par All of this is an important reminder that sincere believers should consider this issue and make the necessary material and spiritual preparations by liste
ning to their consciences. Those who heed this reminder may hope to achieve the honor of being this great individual's helpmates and supporters when he returns, as revealed by our beloved Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace). This should be the
 prayer of all faithful Muslims.

Darwinism, in other words the theory of evolution, was put forward with the aim of denying the fact of creation, but is in truth nothing but failed, unscientific nonsense. This theory, which c
laims that life emerged by chance from inanimate matter, was invalidated by the scientific evidence of clear "design" in the universe and in living things. In this way, science confirmed the fact that God created the universe and the living things in it. 
The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.
\par Yet this propaganda cannot conceal the truth. The
 fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of D
a
rwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism a
nd employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This "intelligent design" is a scientific expression of the fact that God created all living things.
\par We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of cr
eation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here.

Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's }{\rtlch\fcs1 
\ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 The Origin of Species,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
 published in 1859. In this book, he denied that God created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on
 any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties on Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested al
l of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be re
viewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. 
\par 2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests.
\par In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines:

l that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions 
that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coinciden
tally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of bi

structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from whe
at. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence 
of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

acteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved sponta
neous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22

The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book:}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067

\par Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can ru
n faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. 
\par Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 The Origin of Species:}{

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived
 before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed th
at giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 The Origin of Species}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\up6\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 149}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 
\par However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the leg
end that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as i
t is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variat
ions" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., e
ars, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 

\par The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \ltrpar\s16\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid7091067 \rtlch\fcs1 \af8\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0 \f8\fs20\lang1033\langfe1055\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1055 {
\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful
 since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a buildin
g, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\up6\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 150}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0

 to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them
 
disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows 
us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "evolution" could have taken place.

alf-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they 
already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as "transitional forms."

\par The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and
 unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and p
o
tassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an "experiment" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they real
ly claim without pronouncing loudly under the name "Darwinian formula":
\par Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let t
hem add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids \endash  which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions \endash 
 and as many proteins \endash  a single one of which has a formation probability of 10}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\fs22\cf1\up6\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067 -950}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid5179159\charrsid7091067  \endash  as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientis
ts beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cann
o
t produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, date
s, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain even a single cell of any one of them. 
\par Briefly, unconscious ato
ms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that mi
croscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with God's superior creation. 
\par The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of evolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall opp
ositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of pr
ocesses. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by lig
ht and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to atta
in it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed televi
s
ion screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve th
i
s sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpnes
s and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve
 the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the f
oreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sh
arp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would 
you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by cha
nce. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the 
brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from ligh
t. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear
 all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in tr
ying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who ha
v
e been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devi
c
es, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never p
erceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

g the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions.

Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge o
f science or civilization, is quite impossible.
\par As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; such scientis
ts as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people, it is quite j
u
stifiable to speak of this theory as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from them as if the
y
 had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of Abraham (pbuh) worshipping idols they had ma
de with their own hands, or the people of Moses (pbuh) worshipping the Golden Calf.
\par In fact, God has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur'an. In many verse, He reveals in many verses that some peoples' minds will be closed and that they will be powerless to see the truth. Some of these verses are as follows:

As for those who do not believe, it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. God has sealed up their hearts and hearing and over their eyes is a

Words cannot express just how astonishing it is that this spell should hold such a wide community in thrall, keep people from the truth, and not be broken for 150 years. It is understandable that one or a few people might believe in impossible scenario
s and claims full of stupidity and illogicality. However, "magic" is the only possible explanation for people from all over the world believing that unconscious and lifeless atoms suddenly decided to come together and form a universe that functions with a
 flawless system of organization, discipline, reason, and consciousness; a planet named Earth with all of its features so perfectly suited to life; and living things full of countless complex systems. 
\par In fact, the Qur'an relates the incident of Moses (pbuh
) and Pharaoh to show that some people who support atheistic philosophies actually influence others by magic. When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told Moses (pbuh) to meet with his own magicians. When Moses (pbuh) did so, he told them to dem
onstrate their abilities first. The verses continue:

ike the other prophets, Jesus (pbuh) called upon his people to worship God, the One and Only, and to avoid all forms of denial, polytheism, and evil. Those who r
ejected him oppressed him and his followers. However, their plot to kill him failed, even though they thought that they had succeeded, because God raised Jesus (pbuh) to His presence. As the Qur\rquote 
an reveals and the hadith corroborate, Jesus (pbuh) will return to Earth. Those who claim that he was killed or is dead are seriously mistaken. This is one of the author\rquote s main focuses.
\par While revealing this truth, the author recalls other very important tidings, such as the fact that the signs of Jesus' (pbuh) secon
d coming are becoming ever more apparent. If God wills, this event is close at hand, and the world will witness momentous events when it occurs.

died arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been 
i
nstrumental in helping many to return their faith in God, and, in many others, to gain a deeper insight into their faith. Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: t
o broaden the reader\rquote s perspective by encouraging him or her to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of God and His unity, and to live by the values He prescribed for them.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0\afs22 \ltrch\fcs0
