\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 The reason why a special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of ev
olution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of God, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into
 
doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one o
f our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of Qur'anic verses, and people are invited to learn God's words and to live by
 them. All the subjects that concern God's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group
 
can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness o
f their contents. 
\par This book and all the other works by Harun Yahya can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in that they will be able to relate their own refle
ctions and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and circulation of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of God. All the books of the author are extremely co
nvincing, so, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.
\par It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. 
\par In them, one will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, s
tyles unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, or hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart.

The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1
9
80s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark 
liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cove
r of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad, the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to disprove eac
h
 one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of hi
s intention of saying this last word. 
\par All author's works center around one goal: to convey the Qur'an's message to people, encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues (such as the existence of God, His unity and the Hereafter), and to expose t
he feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, Fren
ch, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers worldwide. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been inst
rumental in many people recovering their faith in God and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any one who reads or stu
d
ies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer sincerely advocate 
t
he materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements 
of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts 
in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Tho
se who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers' conviction. 
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 One point should be kept in m
ind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of
 
creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and ef
fectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the 21st century will attain the peac
e, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Throughout their entire lives, everyone is at war with an enemy, the extent of whose strength and influence they perhaps fail to fully comprehend. The main feature of this enemy
 is subtlety. He constantly invites mankind to commit evil, and many people he uses without them even being aware of it. Those who are constantly in conflict with others, who always believe that violence is the answer, who take pleasure in brutality, murd
e
r, chaos and anarchy, in short, those who harm the peace and security of the world, have lost the war against this foe, whether they realize it or not, and have fallen under his control. This most dangerous enemy is the Devil, described to us in all his a
s
pects by God in the Qur'an. The Devil is a force who, ever since the time of the Prophet Adam, has been doing all in his power to turn man away from God. One of the most common errors people commit is their failure to adequately estimate the Devil, that o
ne who incites them to wickedness and leads them to Hell. The fact is, however, that the Devil poses a serious danger to man, and is his declared enemy. In a verse, God reveals:

\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 One of the most devious quagmires that the Devil sets up for people is conflict, terror and anarchy. As God revealed in another verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
"The Devil wants to stir up trouble between them"}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  }{\b\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid16142064 (Qur'an, 17: 53)}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
; to destroy feelings of friendship, love, compassion, forgiveness, peace and trust between people, and to incite them towards violence, are the objectives of the Devil
. However, one point should be stressed here. Although the Devil appears to be a creature who is active on many fronts, he is, in fact, under God's control and is His subject. He knows that God has granted him a set time until the day of judgement, and th
at he will have to pay for sins when that time comes. The promises he fabricates to encourage people to join him, and the schemes he sets in motion, are all part of his deceptions. God describes this fact of the Devil:

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 They are like the Devil when he says to a human being, "Disbelieve," and then when he disbelieves, says, "I wash my hands of you. Truly I fear God, the Lord of all the worlds." (Surat al-Hasr: 16)

\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Nevertheless, the Devil is able to influence certain people (those who do not believe in God, a
nd who do not know or fear Him as they should). The degree of this influence depends on the circumstances. He is often behind certain events which impel human societies into disaster and which cause harm to the innocent. One of the greatest sources of mis
ery effected by the Devil in our time is, without a doubt, terrorism.
\par The hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, also mention that, during the end times, a devilish power will emerge, one of whose most important attributes will be that he disru
pts the peace and order of mankind. Many people, though, attach little importance to that power, known as the Antichrist (Dajjal). That is because, most people either have little knowledge of the matter, or have never heard of it at all. However, the subj
e
ct of the Antichrist is very prominent in those of the Prophet's hadiths which point out that the last day is approaching, and about which a substantial amount of information has been provided. The aim of this book is to describe the characteristics of th
e Antichrist, one of the Devil's primary minions on earth, as set out in the hadiths, and to allow the reader to acquire more familiarity with this Devilish power, of which God's messenger (pbuh) has warned us.
\par From the hadiths, one would ordinarily think o
f him as an individual. However, as well as an individual, it can also be an ideology that tends towards violence and savagery, possesses devilish characteristics, and inflicts suffering on mankind. Later chapters of this book will treat that aspect, and 
d
emonstrate that the Antichrist is a perverted ideological movement that has enormous influence in the world. That movement holds whole communities under its spell, attracts followers despite all its manifest absurdities and errors, and even has its own di
ffering sects within it.
\par Another important matter that will be considered in this book is the way this movement inspires fear and unease in people, giving rise to chaos and anarchy, and destroying peace and security, in order to consolidate its hold on the 
entire world. One of the most frequently employed methods that the movement in question resorts to, in order to achieve its aims, is acts of violence and terrorism aimed at the innocent. In other words, terrorism is the most prominent element of the way o
f the Antichrist. That element is employed by the disciples of the system, in hysteria and rage, as if it were a holy rite.
\par The wars, conflicts, acts of brutal terrorism, slaughter and acts of genocide that still go on in various parts of the world today, a
re the work of the Antichrist, the principle devilish power in the run-up to the last day. The main aim of that system is to turn people away from religious belief, proper morality, spiritual depth, love and all human values, and to turn them into uncompa
s
sionate and aggressive creatures that take pleasure in savagery and violence, and thus turn the whole world into a battleground. However, it must never be forgotten that this plan will not succeed, and that the system of the Antichrist is doomed to annihi
l
ation. Whatever the degree of the strife and chaos it manages to create, the ideological system of the Antichrist is doomed, under the law of God, to ultimate defeat and destruction. By the will of God, that defeat will come about by means of a war of ide
a
s waged by those who turn to Him with true sincerity and strive to bring about the spread of belief and proper morality all over the world. That is a promise made by God to the believers. The following verse is the way in which God says that the truth wil

Today, materialism, and the various ideologies and movements that it gives birth to, are the primary components contributing to corruption in the world. All such movemen
ts, in effect, received their so-called scientific justification from the same source, and share the same fundamental foundation: Darwinism. Ever since Darwinism was first put forward, it has been the principle justification for materialist and anti-relig
i
ous ideologies and movements, and even itself been elevated to the status of a religion by those who support such ideologies. The great Islamic scholar Bediuzzaman Said Nursi stressed that Darwinism would become the religion of the Antichrist in the end o

As Bediuzzaman made clear, with the words
 "a tyrannical current born of Naturalist and Materialist philosophy," Darwinism is a teaching that attributes an independent power to nature, claims that life was not created, but emerged as a result of chance, and tries to distance mankind from belief i
n God. In the book }{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Teysir-al Wusul ila Jami-al Usul}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
, which contains the collected hadiths of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), together with a commentary on them, the subject is dealt with in these terms:
\par }\pard\plain \s16\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid12877188 \f8\fs20\lang1033\langfe1055\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1055 {\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
The clearest and most important feature of the strife of 
the end times that the Antichrist gives rise to is the fact that it is opposed to religion. Various humanist views and values that will emerge at that time will attempt to replace religion. This new religion takes denial as its basis in order to do away w
ith all forms of divine rule over man \'85 It is an anti-religious religion whose basic deity is matter and man}{\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 5}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

The humanist views mentioned in the above quote have today actually taken on the aspects of a religion. Modern humanism is an atheistic religion i
n which the existence of God is denied, and man is regarded as a sacred being to be venerated. When one examines the publications of humanists, it is clear that their world view is entirely based on the theory of evolution. (For further details, see }{
\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Global Freemasonry}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 , by Harun Yahya, Istanbul, 2002)
\par Blind chance is the central premise employed in Darwinism for maintaining that life came about out of inanimate matter and developed by means of an evolutionary process. According to this deceptive ideology, al
l living species began from one single cell that came about by chance, in other words from one common ancestor, and then evolved from one another over time by means of minute changes, again by pure coincidence. The theory lacks any scientific or rational 
b
asis, is nothing but a fantasy, and was widely accepted in Darwin's day on account of the primitive level of science and the sociological conditions at the time. However, as science and technology progressed it was realized that the theory was actually co
mplete nonsense. Yet, despite that, there are still people today who are unable to abandon the nonsensical theory, as we shall see later. 
\par Ever since Darwinism was first advanced, it has been the primary theoretical justification for materialist and anti-religious ideologies and movements, and has been elevated to the near status of creed by their proponents.
\par When those who believe in this superstition are asked how life might have first come about, they reply "Living things came about by chance." In actual 
fact, however, chance is an uncontrolled, unreasoning and aimless force. God, however, creates everything according to a plan, in an ordered, intelligent and specific manner. When a person examines an object of creation, he realizes that it is part of a d
e
sign and was brought into existence by an intelligent and conscious being. Moreover, it is not a conclusion that requires a great deal of thought to arrive at. It is immediately apparent. For instance, when someone enters a room he knows that when he sees
 
a chair, table, clock and a television, that they were made by someone and placed in that room. He also knows that someone installed everything in that room according to a specific order. He would certainly never consider that the table, chair, clock and 
television had come into being by themselves, or had entered the room and placed themselves of their own doing. If anyone were to believe that such a thing were possible, his sanity would have to be questioned. 
\par In the same way, someone who believes in such
 a senseless notion as Darwinism is in effect claiming that apples, oranges, strawberries, grapes, melons, watermelons, cherries, plums, peaches, apricots, roses, lilacs, hyacinths, violets, magnolias, carnations, cats, antelopes, tigers, rabbits, squirre
l
s, zebras, giraffes, and all the myriad other species in the world, and even engineers, doctors, professors, academics, artists and statesmen, in short everyone in the world, had come about of their own accord as the result of chance. To put it another wa
y
, such a person believes that everything he sees is the result of chance. That means that "chance" is that person's god. Yet on careful inspection, that so-called god is one with no power of reason at all, and thus the most unintelligent god imaginable. T
hat "god" is unaware of even its own existence, as well of that of what it has brought into being.
\par In one hadith regarding the Antichrist, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said, "Ad-Dajjal is blind."}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 6}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  Some Islamic scholars have interpreted that hadith to mean "T
he eye of the Antichrist's heart is blind."}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 7 }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
That interpretation helps us to better understand the facts we just mentioned. In the same way, the eye of the heart of someone who makes a god out of blind chance is also blind, as is the eye of his reason. Suc
h people immediately object when it is suggested that "God created the whole universe with superior intelligence, order and design." Yet when it is suggested that "Everything is the result of blind chance," they find that completely logical. Instead of an
 
intelligent and conscious creator, they prefer the totally unreasonable idea that blind chance, lacking all intelligence and creative ability, created everything out of anarchy and chaos. Therefore, Darwinism is the most illogical and superstitious religi
o
n in the history of the world. Another surprising fact is the way in which a number of highly educated people adopt it as their religion, even though it is clearly false. Professors, politicians, teachers, lawyers and even doctors allow themselves to beli
eve in this nonsense. This shows to what extent the ideas of the Antichrist entrance people like a magic spell.
\par So, just what is it that leads certain people to believe such an irrational and illogical claim, and to even fiercely defend it?
\par What we are dealing with here is an intensive propaganda campaign aimed at spreading the ideological system of the Antichrist in the time before the last days. In order to render this campaign as effective as possible, people are bombarded with indoctrina
t
ion throughout their lives, and thus over time are coerced into adopting that twisted religion. This indoctrination, which people are exposed to even from childhood, consists of various phases, during each one of which people take a further step in the di
r
ection of the dark world of the Antichrist. The most effective way of protecting oneself from that bombardment is to listen to only the voice of one's conscience. Because, by the grace of God, our conscience is a guide that ensures our adherence to the tr
u
e path. Darwinism, on the other hand, which has suffered a complete collapse scientifically, is today only defended as an ideological viewpoint, the senselessness of which can be demonstrated not only by the scientific evidence but also by listening to th
e voice of one's own conscience. 
\par In order to be on one's guard against such constant indoctrination, and to understand the workings of it, we need to examine its various phases.

people tend to offer two types of answers. The first, and correct, answer is that it was God that created everything, himself included, and that people are responsible to God, who created them from nothing and enables them to grow, eat, drink and breathe,
 and who protects them. God holds the entire universe under His control, is omnipresent, and sees and hears everything.

Someone who thinks that life is the result of chance and coincidence, even if he is not fully conscious in the early stages of his believing in it, comes to believe that matter is the only abso

 "only survive so long as he is strong and selfish."
\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 That idea is first instilled by the family, and then becomes stronger and more broadly based when the child starts school. The indoctrination the child receives from his family and his surroundings is rei
nforced by entirely unscientific theories, which are nevertheless portrayed as sanctioned by science, along the lines of "the ancestors of man were animals, for which reason the relationships between animals also apply to those between people." In this wa

Yet, there remains another important phase in his education. That is the teaching of the falsehood that he is responsible to nobody but himself. 
According to this superstition, if matter has always existed and will always continue to do so, if life is solely the product of chance, and furthermore, if death is total extinction, then the only thing that matters is material gain. In a world made up o
nly of matter, spiritual values can have no place. That being the case, the only thing people ought to think about is satisfying their own desires and passions, by whatever means necessary. According to the following verse in the Qur'an, }{
\b\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 "Did you suppose that We created you for amusement and that you would not return to Us?" }{\b\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid8541247 (Qur'an, 23: 115),}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
 God clearly reveals the distorted outlook of these ignorant people.
\par People who genuinely believe that they can live unfettered lives, and that they will in the end mer
ely cease to exist, are committing a serious mistake. We are responsible to our Lord, who created us from nothing. It is God who created man to accord with a particular destiny, who knows each person's past, present and future, who at death will call him 
t
o account for his past deeds, and reward or punish him accordingly. Unlike animals, God has created man with a soul, a mind, free-will and conscience. In other words, even if someone feels a certain temptation during a specific situation, he has been crea
ted with the necessary qualities to prevent him committing evil.
\par Someone who is unaware of or who ignores this truth will obviously pose a danger to the society of which he is a part. For instance, someone who is angered by something that has happened can b
ehave quite ruthlessly, and harm the person responsible without thinking. It makes no difference if that person were defenseless. All that matters is venting his anger. Yet, someone who knows that he possesses a soul given him by God, who exercises his re
a
son and his conscience, is capable of controlling his anger. He always remains in self-control and conscientious. Such a person would not dare to do the slightest thing that could earn him punishment from God. If he does happen to commit a sin, he repents
 and puts things right.
\par This is how God reminds those who imagine that they are free from restraint that they have been created and will be resurrected after death:

\par These two ideologies can be regarded as the two main sects of the religion of the Antichrist. The founders and major leaders of both ideologies were all devoted to Darwini

Fascism, and all its methods, is diametrically opposed to religious morality. One of the distinguishing c
haracteristics of fascism is its tendency to kill thousands of innocent people in the name of its own so-called "sacred" values, and of actually regarding that slaughter as virtuous. That is why war and conflict are inseparable components of fascism. 

\par The anger and hatred directed towards people of different races is another fundamental element of fascism. This racist tendency has inspired numerous wars, conflicts, death and ethnic cleansings.
\par Strict discipline is an inherent part of a fascist regime. All ideas that conflict with it are eliminated. The burning of thousands of books during Hitler's Reich, simply because they contained "non-German ideas," is just one example of this.
\par In order to win people over, fascism instills in people the notion th
at their race is superior to all others. The real aim is the construction of a system built upon the concept of race. It is clear, however, that in an environment in which every race thinks it is superior there will never be an end to war and conflict. Th
e disasters that fascist dictators, such as Hitler and Mussolini, have inflicted on their people are some of the most striking proofs of the fact that the ideas espoused by fascism are nothing but falsehoods.
\par The above-mentioned characteristics are just a f
ew examples to give you a general idea of these ideologies. When one considers the way these ideologies are implemented, it becomes still more obvious to what extent they are inherently violent and brutal. Yet, the truly important thing to note is the way
 
of the Antichrist, and the ideologies linked to it, can be adopted by whole segments of society, despite all the terrible destruction they inflict. For that reason, it is most important to examine the way in which the system of the Antichrist brings socie
t
y under its control. To reveal how that is done will be the first round shot in the war of ideas to be waged against that system. That is to say, that people do not suddenly become selfish, aggressive, ruthless individuals filled with hatred and a thirst 
f
or revenge overnight. As we have already seen, they can only be accustomed to the system of the Antichrist over time, in stages. The process begins when people first become conscious of their surroundings beginning the learning process, and it continues t
hroughout their lives. That indoctrination starts with turning people away from faith in God.
\par The primary sects we have been considering themselves consist of different groups and adherents. Subsequent chapters of this book will examine the links between th
e Antichrist and terrorism and these sub-groups. However, it will first be useful to have a look at how the Antichrist is treated in the Qur'an.

One of the most important traits of evildoers is the way they are misled by their own passions and individual desires, instead of by the morality of the Qur'an. However, being dominated by one's ego (}{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 an-nafs}{

 begins to act in conformity to his lower self, it leads to internal mental chaos and a complete lack of restraint. Instead of the peace of mind and tranquility that come from listening to the voice of one's conscience, comes insecurity, restlessness, wor

is expressed in the following terms in the Qur'an:

The most harmful aspect of the system of the Antichrist is that it is built on spreading corruption and damaging peace and order. The defining characteristic of the Antichrist is to encourage terror and anarchy in order to spread corruption. The latter of
 
course has wide-ranging ramifications, and can include frightening people and making them uneasy, and wreaking peace and security. Unjustified wars between nations, internal conflict sparked off by artificial causes, terrorist attacks aimed at innocent ci

Another method employed by the Antichrist to cause corruption and confusion in the world is to encourage people towards extremism, or fanaticism. In this way, people are led to believe that they are justified in behaving in a fanatical manner for the sake
 
of their beliefs or ideals. They are led astray by the idea that results that could otherwise be obtained by compromise and dialogue can only be reached by resorting to violence. Through this state of mind, simple envy or unjustified anger can result in s
a
vage brutality. Because extremism often represents the very opposite of moderation, common sense, and rational behavior. Such people follow only their emotions. Their reactions and general comportment are governed by violence and rage. That is what leads 
to the emergence of groups and individuals who too easily resort to all forms of violence without ever questioning why, nor feeling any pang of conscience.

\par We have so far looked at the kind of movement the Antichrist, the gre
atest purveyor of discord in the days leading up to doomsday, represents, and what kind of people are ensnared by it. In this chapter, we shall consider terrorism, one of the gravest contributors to this strife.
\par Although it is one of the most commonly hear
d terms in the world today, there is still no definition of it that all can agree on. One of the main reasons for this is that people who are regarded as terrorists by some, are regarded by others as those engaged in a just struggle. Whatever the aim may 
b
e, it is never possible to regard any group that resorts to violence and targets innocent people as just. Individuals or societies may desire different things, and these aspirations may be entirely valid. Yet, violence is not the way to bring them about. 
Force should only be used in self-defense. For that reason, any act of violence aimed at innocent people may be regarded as an act of terrorism.
\par The fundamental strategy of terrorism is the spreading of fear, and by it to gain influence. Instead of working 
for their aspirations through more peaceable and reasonable means, terrorist groups turn to violence, which they regard is far more effective. According to them, the more ruthless and destructive an act of terrorism is, the more terrifying it is, in other
 words the nearer it will have come to achieving its aim.
\par One of the most dreadful aspects of terrorism is the fact that it is devoid of all moral values and recognizes no rules. People who turn to terrorism lack all love, affection, compassion and toleranc
e, and are solely governed by feelings of hatred, anger and revenge. Unconsciously, such people's intention is to relieve their anger and take revenge, without considering the result of their actions. The idea of the damage that their actions might result
 in causes not the slightest stirrings of their conscience. Because, conscience of the kind of person who regards terrorism as any kind of solution is obstructed, as, therefore, are his reason, foresight and understanding.
\par According to the morality of the Q
ur'an, however, there is no room for anger. God has revealed that so long as people act in the light of individual emotions, such as anger, there will be corruption and chaos in the world. He has therefore commanded us for all time to behave with a tolera
n
t, peaceful and brotherly spirit. When people abide by that morality, however, the system of the Antichrist, based as it is in violence, will completely collapse, terror and anarchy will disappear, and the climate of chaos that currently prevails in the w
orld will come to an end. This is how God recommends that morality in one verse;

The morality of religion forbids all kinds of terrorist acts, and yet, a number of terrorist groups still claim that they are acting in its name. Yet, when one has a close look at the world-views of those who carry out massacres or employ violence as a me
t
hod, it is quite clear that such people are deviant. They have no idea of truth of religion, and are unable to live by or comprehend its morality. Anyone who genuinely believes in the existence of God, who truly fears Him and abides by the book revealed b
y Him would never be able to take any kind of action that might harm innocent and defenseless people. Those who carry out acts of terrorism and violence in the name of Islam, therefore, cannot possibly be called religious groups.
\par The true message of a relig
ion or other system of ideas may sometimes be twisted by its so-called supporters, or interpreted incorrectly. That applies to Judaism as well as Christianity. The Crusaders, for instance, were European Christians who set out from Europe at the end of the
 11th century with the aim of liberating the Holy Land. They may have set out with an alleged religious agenda, but they spread fear and barbarity wherever they went.
\par The savagery of these barbarians who misinterpreted Christianity, which is a religion of love and certainly has no room for violence, clearly had nothing to do with genuine religion at all.
\par Most of those who resort to terror in the name of religion are fanatical groups linked to pagan beliefs or newly developed mystical teachings, not the divin
e religions at all. These groups, and especially those in America and Japan, carry out terrible acts of violence against their own members as well as other people. These include the groups that burned themselves to death on a farm, or committed mass suici
d
e in their beds, or the people who harmed others by releasing poison gas in the Japanese underground system. Other groups that have come to notice, due to their acts of terrorism, include fanatical racists such as the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups. Ove
r
 the last 20 years in particular, there has been a visible increase in racist and fascist ideas among young people, and that has led to an increase in the number of acts of violence. The attacks perpetrated against Turks in Germany a few years ago, the ab
u
se and assaults aimed at people of Asian and African origin in other European countries, and the acts of violence against Blacks and Arabs that still take place in the United States even today, can all be included among the range of methods employed by su
ch groups. 
\par It must not be forgotten that, at the basis of all deviant movements, both those considered in this book and others that we have not dealt with, lies the fact that people have turned their backs on the morality of religion, and have been raised 
without true knowledge of the religion The common religious morality of Islam, Christianity and Judaism is diametrically opposed to the system of the Antichrist, built as it is on violence and savagery. At the root of religion lies love, affection and com
p
assion. God has commanded us to treat one another with justice, tolerance, understanding, compassion and respect. Furthermore, people are charged with effecting that kind of behavior no matter what the religion, language, race or gender of the person they
 are dealing with. For that reason, it is impossible for there to be violence in a society where the morality of religion prevails. The morality of religion is the only system that can lead people to peace and security. God reveals in one verse:

s madness sparked off by a racist and fascist ideology. Violence and conflict, the so-called sacred values of these ideologies, briskly infected the entire world, leading to 55 million people falling victim to fascist savagery. Though the fact that victor
y
 fell upon the Allies meant that fascism was defeated, it did not disappear. It merely went underground. As a whole, there has been a discernable rise in the number of racist and fascist organizations and acts of violence in the world over the last 10 yea
r
s. While Europe battles with acts of violence perpetrated by neo-Nazis, the United States has had to deal with a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and similar "white supremacy" organizations. Today, both the neo-Nazis and the members of the Ku Klux Klan are 
carrying out attacks and encouraging their members to commits acts of terror and violence.
\par Many people may imagine that the Ku Klux Klan had carried out most of its attacks on and oppression of Blacks merely in the 1920s and 1930s, but that in modern times 
it had been consigned to the waste bin of history. The Klan is still alive, however. Today, in the United States as a whole, there are a great many Ku Klux Klan churches, even if they happen to go by other names, and many racist organizations linked to th
a
t church's teachings. That church and the organizations linked to it are not just against Blacks, but oppose all non-European races, especially the Muslims living in America, believing that a concerted struggle needs to be waged against them. That "strugg
le" includes the formation of armed units.
\par It is no secret that the basis of the Klan's teachings is that European whites are superior to all other races, and that the white race should never be polluted by those others. In order to prevent such contamination, other races must not be permitted to 
l
ive in areas inhabited by the white race. The idea is that the other races have no right to the kinds of opportunities enjoyed by the whites. These races are regarded as parasites trying to contaminate the purity and superiority of the whites, and it is b
e
lieved that all kinds of measures need to be taken to oppose them. These views of the Klan are the basis for the attacks carried out against other races in America. At the root of these ideas, lies hatred and aggression instead of love, tolerance and dial
ogue.
\par The so-called scientific justification for the concept of the superiority of the white race is Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin had suggested that certain races, the European race for instance, had progressed further than other races during the ev
olutionary process. Those outside these advanced races were in his view primitive creatures little better than apes. To put it another way, while some races had made enormous evolutionary progress, others were still at a level not far removed from man's p
rimitive ancestor, the ape. Darwin indulged in racist speculation about the future, and wrote:

These racist views of Darwin's became an important justification used in the service
 of the colonialist powers of the time to disguise their own brutality. The claim that Darwin put forward to demonstrate his theory is extremely interesting in the point of view of revealing his ignorance and prejudice. In a letter to a scientist named W.
 Graham in 1881, Darwin cited the Turkish nation as a proof of his theory. According to this nonsense of Darwin's, the Turkish nation was one of those backward peoples that would soon disappear:

c
ertain circles influenced by this and similar organizations stepped up their attacks. Businesses, mosques and associations belonging to Muslims in a number of states were attacked. Muslim students were not allowed into school, and Muslim children were ass

 down, for which reason they merit all kinds of inhuman treatment. A great number of people in America still hold to this view. It is fair to say that these groups, organized under different names, such as the National Alliance, the World Church of the Cr

\par The most important common factor between the views of these organizations, some of which we shall be looking at below, is that they have no qualms about using violence to achieve their aims, but rather often regard violence and aggression as necessary.

As is the case with many racist organizations, Rahowa is founded fundamentally on the bel
ief in evolution. Such a degree of hostility towards other races, and the lack of any compunction over the using of violence as a means, are all the result of the belief in the theory of evolution. Nothing can prevent anyone who regards somebody else as a

Rather than a religion such as Christianity, which tells them to love their enemies, love the meek and the inferior. We need a religion, which exalts our own people and our own people alone\'85
 So we need to recognize this and do away with the idea that all men are created equal and idiotic notions of that kind\'85
 what we believe in doing is ending all aid to all non-white races. We believe that without this aid the non-white races would very quickly shrink their own numbers. They could not feed themselves\'85
 We believe that a perfect world is much more possible by having only white people, white racial comrades around the world. And we believe that once the non-white races are gone, and the white ra

The following articles were taken from a speech by Matt Hale at a Klan rally on January 14, 2001:
\par Saying the races are equal is an insult to our race.
\par We despise and abhor integration, interracial marriage and the flooding of this country with non-White hoards.
\par Interracial marriage is a sin against our people.
\par The Civil Rights movement was wrong for us. It was wrong for our interests.
\par The white race is intellectually superior to all other races.
\par When we have our day, when we are in power in this world as we wish to be, as we will be, certainly we will subsidize the best of our race, the most intelligent of our race to have the most children.
\par The future is going to be one in which we have a land that is White and we will repatriate the other races.
\par They would be pushed on the boats by force\emdash within the law! That's going to be the law.
\par Non-Whites are absolutely irrelevant. If they were lying in a pool of blood, it would be absolutely irrelevant. It simply means nothing to me. What I care about is my own racial family. 
\par The brain makes the races different. The races have different shapes and sizes of brains.
\par On why most serial killers have been White \'85 White people plan what they do. White people actually think. Most of the crimes that Blacks commit are impulsive. White people think about the cri
me they are going to commit. White people are involved in this type of crime because it takes a lot of planning.}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 23}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

One of the fascist organizations enjoying increasing support from young people in America is the National Alliance. The organization was first founde
d in 1970 by Dr. William Pierce, a young professor of physics at Oregon State University, as the National Youth Alliance. Its outstanding characteristic was the way it targeted colleges and universities. Age of membership was restricted to 30 and under. L
a
ter, however, that age barrier was lifted and a new organization was created called the National Alliance. One of the principle objectives of this organization attaches great importance to the rearing up of young people with racist ideas. That, it is beli
e
ved, will enable future generations to emerge in the awareness of racial superiority. Like all other racist groups, the National Alliance aims to defend the superiority of the white race under all circumstances. Dr. Pierce summed up this objective during 
an interview he gave in 1997:

While racist groups that represent racism and xenophobia come together under the umbrella of the Ku Klux Klan in America, the neo-Nazis perform the same role in Europe. European racism began with the skinheads in Great Britain, and turned into a neo-Nazi 
movement in the 1990s. The main characteristics of these groups which define themselves as neo-Nazis are the way that, just like the Ku Klux Klan, they maintain the superiority of the white race and attack foreigners and those living in poorer areas.

\par Louis Beam and William Pierce, extreme right-wing A
merican ideologues, share a very important place in the neo-Nazi movement that developed during the 1990s. The concepts of "leaderless resistance" and "white revolution" put forward by these men have now come to dominate the thought of the neo-Nazi moveme

t. At the root of various acts of terror, such as bombings, looting, and the destruction of workplaces in numerous countries of the world, can continually be found their concept of "leaderless resistance." According to their idea, neo-Nazi actions aught t

\par McVeigh claimed to have carried out that bomb
ing in revenge for David Koresh and his followers who burned to death on a farm in 1993. According to McVeigh, Koresh and the cult members did not kill themselves, but were actually murdered by the American state. He therefore decided to take revenge on t
h
at state, and planned to bomb the people working in its name in the Federal Building. Exactly two years after the deaths of Koresh and his cult followers, on the second anniversary in fact, McVeigh cold-bloodedly parked a lorry full of explosives in front
 
of the Federal Building and the rest is history. After the attack, McVeigh was helped by another neo-Nazi, Terry Nichols. The most important fact to recognize about those who supported Nichols and McVeigh before the attack, who helped locate the explosive
s and knew what McVeigh was up to, is that they were all neo-Nazis.

\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Satanism is a perverted ideology that makes violence and savagery a ritual in its creed. Satanists, who describe themselves as such, make deeds of inhumanity and brutality into acts of worship.
\par When the word Satanism is mentioned most people think merely of its widespread psychological influence on young people, and re
gard it as a kind of insignificant mystical movement. Also, due to the influence of the media, they may think of Satanists as performing strange rituals, much unlike what ordinary and well-balanced people would otherwise do. It is true that Satanists are 
p
art of a culture of violence and perform strange and horrible rites, yet, what most people fail to see is that Satanism is a materialist and atheist ideology that supports violence and which dates back to the 1800s. Furthermore, the ideology has a large n
umber of followers throughout the world.
\par The fundamental principle of Satanism is that it rejects all religious values, takes the Devil as its deity, and claims that hell is a kind of salvation. According to the belief of Satanism, people have no responsibi
lities, apart from that of following their own desires. If his desires lead a person to anger, hatred, revenge, deceit, theft, the harming others or even murder, then that is acceptable. The basic logic that Satanism relies on, in support of that belief, 
is the claim that the avoidance of evil is a kind of insincerity. In other words, this perverted belief maintains that if his desires impel someone to kill another, and if he acts according to that impulse, then he has behaved sincerely.
\par Virtues such as lov
e, tolerance, patience and forgiveness, which are highly esteemed by most people, and are elements of the true morality, are loathed by Satanists. This deviant ideology maintains that there should be no restrictions on evil and such feelings as hatred, an
ger and vengeance. Article 5 of }{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 The Satanic Bible, }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
widely regarded as the fundamental textbook of Satanism, states, instead of the biblical principle that says "To him who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also." that "Satan represents vengeance, in
stead of turning the other cheek." Elsewhere in that same book appears the commandment:

It is obvious that according to such thinking it will be impossibl
e to prevent any kind wickedness. Such an atmosphere will inevitably lead to chaos and strife. It is impossible to speak of order, peace, stability, security, forgiveness or tolerance in any society in which people do not listen to the voice of their cons
c
iences, and are thus unable to distinguish between good and bad, and to use their will and judgment to act for good. In an environment of that sort, anyone who feels anger towards somebody else will be unable to restrain that anger and behave with moderat
i
on, and will inevitably seek his revenge. Alternatively, instead of being patient in times of need and poverty, and attempting to address those needs in a sensible manner, these people will resort to theft and other sorts of crime. Satanism is their justi
fication for doing so.
\par The kind of society proposed by the ideology of Satanism recognizes no rules and no bounds. Its aim is the free expression of selfish desires and evil. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 The Satanic Bible}{
\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 , Anton LaVey, regarded as the founder of modern Sata
nism, recommends to his followers that they live by and promote wickedness as they so please. In an interview, LaVey even said: "I feel laws are, obviously, made to be broken ... I see nothing wrong with robbing somebody on the street.}{
\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 32}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
\par Satanism's refusal
 to recognize any bounds does not stop there, of course. People would not only harm themselves and those around them, but would direct their hostility and anger at all. That refusal to recognize any limits, moreover, leads to the regard of violence as an 
i
ntrinsic part of life. According to Satanism, violence is a fact of nature, and thus inescapable. Therefore, this distorted view maintains that it is perfectly permissible for people to resort to violence. Since any attempt to prevent or minimize violence
 is a violation of what is natural, any attempt to do so is futile, and it is therefore illogical to do so. 
\par As we have seen, Satanism holds utterly perverse beliefs, which encourage people to be aggressive, to commit murder, and even mass slaughter. In Ame
rica in particular, academics have established that Satanism lies at the root of national terror, and that serious steps need to be taken in order to deal with it. One of these academics is Carl Roschke, a professor at Denver University, who has stressed 
the importance of the subject in the words, "We're really dealing with the way satanic ideology has become a basis for domestic terrorism."}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 33}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
 Roschke says that the most important step in the war to be waged against Satanism is to make it clear that its foll
owers are not just "harmless wackoes," but that when their crimes are examined, one can understand just how harmful someone claiming to be a Satanist can be. }{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 34}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

Of course, the idea of justice, as set out above, has absolutely no resemblance to the notion of justice as we know it should be, that is, established on the principle o

\par The way Satanism shares so many parallels 
with Social Darwinism, which regards Western society as superior to others, has led to cooperation between it and a number of other racist and chauvinistic movements, especially fascism. One can find many individuals who believed in Satanism among the ran

Another expression of the Satanists' attachment to Social Darwinism is their fierce support for the theory of eugenics, itself the 
product of fascism. The theory of eugenics maintained that the sick and the crippled ought to be eliminated from society, and the number of healthy individuals increased through breeding. The theory was most prominently implemented in Nazi Germany. Accord
i

One can recognize such perversion, immorality and savagery in any society that takes Satan as its guide. For Satanists, these things are inspired by the Devil himself, and must be adhered to. Satanists, who do adhere to th
em, fall into forms of sexual perversions, torture humans as well as animals, and even perform such disgusting things as the drinking of the blood of the creatures or people they kill. In many countries of the world, young people who describe themselves a
s Satanists hold drug-parties at which all kinds of immorality and perversion take place, and which frequently end in the killing of one of their number in the Devil's name. 
\par The way Satanists attach such importance to the shedding of blood at their rituals
 is a small-scale example of the plan Satan has for mankind. Satan hates mankind, and wants to inflict as much suffering on it as possible. It is therefore his aim to fill the world with bloodshed. The ideologies of the Antichrist we discussed earlier, su
ch as fascism, racism and communism, all serve his purpose. All the wars, massacres, killings, and acts of terrorism, linked to these and similar atheistic ideologies, are all "Satanic masses" aimed at satisfying the Devil's lust for blood.

 system of the Antichrist established by him for the world are using those they have managed to take in and are trying to turn the world into a brutal battleground.

We need to bear in mind the Satanis
ts' own views when considering the threat posed by it. When Satanists are asked how many of them there are, they claim to have large numbers of followers, because there are many people who actually live by the tenets of Satanism without being aware of the
 
fact. In a way, that is actually the case. Many people, consciously or unconsciously, share the views of the Satanists. That is because, refusing to listen to the voice of one's conscience, or to live by proper morality, therefore following one's own desi
res, is the same as obeying the commands of the Devil. When one considers all the destruction caused by Satanists up to the present day, it is quite clear in what a terrible state a society consisting of such people is going to end up to be.

 man is a species of animal, on which Satanism is founded, is utter nonsense. Mankind did not come into being as the result of blind chance. The Creator of mankind, and of the order and splendor of the entire universe, is the infinitely powerful, superior
 
and All-Wise God, who has no weaknesses of any kind. He created man with the ability to think and reason, to distinguish between right and wrong, and also with a responsibility towards his Creator. Just as each individual's ego direct him towards evil, so
 
his conscience protects him from it, and commands him to turn away from it. It is man's duty to listen to the voice of his conscience, not to his ego and adopt the kind of morality that is pleasing to God. That morality will not only allow the individual 
concerned, and the society in which he lives, to enjoy a peaceful and secure existence, but will also, by the will of God, lead to the sublimest reward in the hereafter.
\par One important fact that must not be lost sight of is that the life Satan offers, which 
he dresses up to appear so very attractive, is mere deception. Satan may make all kinds of promises about the possibilities of the life of this world, and may try to turn people away form the true path, yet, it must not be forgotten that the road he becko
ns man to follow will only lead to ultimate destruction for those who take it. That is because Satan and his followers have already been defeated. As God explains in a verse:

We have already discussed in earlier chapters the existence in a number of countries of the world, a
nd especially the United States, of superstitious cults that adhere to deviant belief-systems, and how such groups engage in acts of terror. These mystical groups destroy the order of society, encourage nations towards violence, and lead to killings and e
v
en suicides. Some of the best-known of these are: David Koresh and his followers who committed mass suicide, the Heaven's Gate cult who did the same, and the Aum Shinrikyo cult who harmed hundreds of people by releasing poison gas into the Japanese underg
round transit system.
\par In addition to these, however, every day in America are attacks perpetrated by unknown groups as well as mass suicide. The worst mass suicide so far was that of "The People's Temple" cult.
\par Established at the end of the 1970s, under the
 leadership of Jim Jones, this cult lived isolated from the rest of the world in a forest area in Southern America. Following a number of complaints, in 1978, US Congressman Leo Ryan visited the Jonestown area on a fact-finding mission. As Ryan was leavin
g
 Jonestown, 18 temple members who wanted to leave the cult tried to accompany him, at which point violence erupted. Cult members opened fire on those who attempted to leave it. Congressman Ryan, three journalists, and one of the departing members were kil
l
ed. Eleven people were injured. A few hours after that incident, the leader of the cult ordered their members to commit mass suicide by drinking potassium cyanide. Children died first; babies were killed by poison squirted into their mouths with a syringe
. Then more than 900 people, children included, poisoned themselves.}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 43}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
\par By the 1990s, however, the group that attracted the most attention through mass death was the cult of David Koresh. When security units wished to inspect a farm in Texas on February 28, 
1993, cult members opened fire on them. A siege that would last 51 days then ensued. When one member of the security forces tried to get into the farm on the 51st day, smoke suddenly began rising. The security forces announced that David Koresh had set fi
re to the farm, and that booby traps installed in various parts of it had turned the place into an inferno, in which some 90 people burned to death.
\par Deviant cults again hit the headlines in 1997, when some 40 people wearing black T-shirts and sports-shoes c
ommitted mass suicide in the north of San Diego. Aged between 26 and 72, they had killed themselves out of a belief that the Hale-Bopp comet, which was then passing by the earth, would carry them to a higher level of evolution. This is how their ideas wer
e expressed on their website:

These accounts may seem to have very little to do with the lives of most people who are reading this book. Yet, nobody should be deceived by that fact as we have only considered three examples in detail. A large number of deviant cults and organizations a
r
e influencing young people in many countries of the world. The fact that some people regard these movements as being far removed from themselves does not mean that they are not causing terrible harm to individuals and to society as a whole. On the contrar
y, they reveal the different forms the strife of the Antichrist can take and how widespread it actually is.

The harm that such cults cause for the lives and property of their members is by no means the only threat the
y pose. The deviant ideas and lifestyles promoted by these cults also damage the very fabric of society. From time to time, some of them organize attacks directly aimed at the civilian population. One recent example of this was the Japanese cult Aum Shinr
ikyo, and its release of poison gas into a Tokyo metro station. The cult was also held responsible for a similar gas attack in Matsumoto near Tokyo, in which seven people died and 144 were injured.

 Asahara, a person can only cleanse his soul by killing. World domination is only possible by implementing the violence that he teaches his followers. Acts that normal people would regard as cold-blooded, are for the members of the cult true examples of m
orality.
\par The first target of the attacks, which began in 1994, were the judges who had filed charges against the cult and lived in accommodations provided by the Ministry of Justice . The first attack resulted in seven deaths. At the same time, the cult had
 begun the construction of a 70-ton capacity sarin gas production facility, on the orders of Asahara, who also instructed that 1,000 automatic rifles and a million bullets be manufactured. With the help of Russian experts hired by the cult, there were als
o efforts being made to construct a kind of nuclear weapon. Also within Asahara's sphere of activities were kidnappings and murder, especially of lawyers and public prosecutors opposed to the cult's activities.
\par The attack on the underground system resulted 
in a much more severe reaction against the cult. Thousands of commuters on their way to work were affected. Twelve people died and more than 5,000 received treatment in hospital, and the attack became a terrifying example of the threat such groups now pos
e to the public.
\par As we have seen from the above examples, any kind of immorality is to be expected from groups that develop their own beliefs far removed from the morality of religion. The members of such organizations are wholly capable of any kind of devi
ance, from drug abuse to theft, and from kidnapping to torture, though they often only end up in bringing an end to their own lives.
\par One must never forget that it should come as no surprise that people who do not believe in God, have no fear of Him, and re
fuse to recognize true morality, engage in such acts of violence. That is because, they do not believe they will have to account for their deeds, nor that they will receive their just due in the Hereafter. In addition, they would probably adopt entirely i
n
appropriate or false beliefs on the subject of life after death, all in accordance with their desires. The only true path however, is that revealed by God to His servants. Anyone who knows of the religion of God, and lives by it, is moderate and well-bala
n
ced. Furthermore, in the Qur'an, God has commanded man to think and use his reason. It is thus impossible for true believers to get caught-up in any belief system without listening to their consciences and employing their powers of reasoning. The faithful
 
act in accordance with the dictates of their conscience at every moment in their lives, and behave reasonably. That, in turn, protects them from all forms of immorality and perversion. True believers are those who stay firmly rooted on the path revealed b
y God. It is clear, however, that such cults and organizations have long since turned away from that path.
\par There is no question that the acts of violence and terror we have been considering are not the only manifestations of terror in the world today. Very 
many terrorist organizations in a great many countries have for many years been spreading fear, terror, as well as leading to the deaths of many innocent people. These include the IRA, which for many years has been a major thorn in the side of the governm
e
nt of Great Britain; ETA in the Basque region of Spain, ASALA, the Armenian terrorist organization which for many years attacked Turkish diplomats serving abroad, and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Although they all have different ideological motives
,
 all terrorist groups and people who support the use of violence, whether listed here or not, and whether they are aware of the fact or not, agree on one thing. That is, the rejection of religion. Whatever their ideology and world-view may be, the true re
ason why anyone turns to anarchy and violence is that they lack any beliefs and conscience to prevent them from doing so.

\par As we have stressed right through this book, it is peoples' refusal to listen to the voice of their consciences that turn
s them in the direction of violence and savagery. They totally ignore the fact that they are responsible to God and that they will have to account for all their actions in the hereafter. The most effective means of turning such people away from violence a
n
d terrorism, therefore, is in addressing the ignorance that directs them down that road in the first place. While most nations turn to law-enforcement agencies, and political and economic strategies when dealing with terrorism, none of these are sufficien
t
 to resolve the problem on their own. What really needs to be done is to destroy the ideological foundation of terrorism. That requires a war on the level of ideas against all ideologies that promote hatred and anger, and their replacement with the moral 
virtues taught by religion.
\par As we have seen throughout the course of this book, Darwinism is the principle foundation of such ideologies. The only reason why that theory, which has today lost all scientific credibility, and has been shown to be devoid of al
l reason and logic, is still being artificially kept alive, is an ideological attachment to it. When that foundation is eventually done away with, therefore, the ideologies built on it will necessarily collapse. For that reason, the war of ideas against D
arwinism is essential for bringing peace and security to mankind.
\par One important strategy of that war consists of revealing the true source of the ideologies in question, together with all their errors and deceptions. Another important stage is explaining th
e morality of religion, which will bring with it true peace and security. Since most people today have little idea of what the true religion is, they fall under the influence of atheism. That is why explaining the true religion, and the presentation of th
e morality commanded by God to the entire world, is the duty of every person who knows and lives by it.
\par Today, in the world as a whole, the system of the Antichrist prevails, in other words, anarchy, strife and chaos are rife. Throughout history, God has de
stroyed a great many evil and corrupt communities. All societies and movements founded on cruelty and ruthlessness, which resort to violence and terrorism and oppress others, face the same inevitable end. All anarchists and terrorist are doomed to destruc
tion. All nations that support anarchy and terror will be eliminated. Cruelty can never endure. This is how the end of a wrongdoing society is described in the Qur'an,

Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coincidences,
 has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by God. American astrophysicist Hugh Ross explains this as follows:

\par Unsurprisingly, when we
 look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances which atoms rest upon,
 and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with them.

Although a doctrine going back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the 19th century. The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled 
}{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory was failing in the face of 
many critical questions. 
\par }{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that n
o
n-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat wa
s placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while.

Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms di
d not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye.

s widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his
 triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said, }{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."}{\f0\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ende
d up in such a big impasse about the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in
 the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing inorganic materials together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10}{

\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  is practically considered to be impossible.
\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volum
es of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded 
in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, Californ
ia, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\i\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Scientific American}{\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  magazine:

seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. }{\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 51}{

So, how could these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer 
this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation an
d
 these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation 
to generation.

Neo-Darwinism and Mutations
\par }\pard\plain \s15\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid12877188 \f8\fs22\lang1033\langfe1055\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1055 {\f0\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living be
ings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions
 of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wings, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fac
t that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par }\pard\plain \s21\qj \fi567\li0\ri170\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin0\itap0\pararsid12877188 \b\f37\fs24\expnd7\expndtw35\lang1033\langfe1055\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1055 {\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highl
y ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be 
an improvement.}{\f0\fs22\up6\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 54}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "e
volutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural s
e
lection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken
 place.

This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is jus
t the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor can be that this species was
 created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma:

Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of "how we see". Light rays coming from an object
 fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the br
ain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated
. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp a
nd distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct imag
e
 as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, coloured, and extremely sharp image. For more than
 
100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in yo
ur hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. 
\par For many years, ten of thousands 
of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial th
ree-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.

\par Evol
utionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make u
p this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image 
seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them;
 the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is
 insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which
 
is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is preva
iling there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. 
Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI sy
s
tems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of
 
the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since 
the creation of man.
\par So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this.

The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, yo
u
 will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro-chemical nervous impulses as images, sounds, odours and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this w
i
thout feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? There is no doubt that this consciousness does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe
 that everything is comprised of matter, cannot give any answer to these questions. 
\par For this consciousness is the spirit created by God. The spirit needs neither the eye to watch the images, nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, nor does it need the brain to think.

The information we have presen
ted so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a claim evidently at variance with scientific findings. The theory's claim on the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and foss
i
ls demonstrate that the intermediate forms required by the theory never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas such as the earth-centered universe model have be
en taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is pressingly kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against the theory as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is t
hat the theory of evolution is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward for the workings of na
ture.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

These are explicit statements that Da
rwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of differen
t
 living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, etc., out of inanimate matter. This is 
a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All li
ving beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing. This Creator is God, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.

\par Many people think that Darwin's Theory of Evolution is a proven fact. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, recent developments in science completely disprove the theory. The only reason Darwin
ism is still foisted on people by means of a worldwide propaganda campaign lies in the ideological aspects of the theory. All secular ideologies and philosophies try to provide a basis for themselves by relying on the theory of evolution. 
\par This book clarifies the scientific collapse of the theory of evolution in a way that is detailed but easy to understand. It reveals the frauds and distortions committed by evolutionists to "prove" evolution. Finally it analyzes the powers and motives that
 strive to keep this theory alive and make people believe in it.
\par Anyone who wants to learn about the origin of living things, including mankind, needs to read this book. }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 The Evolution Deceit}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 
 is also available in Italian, Albanian, Spanish, Indonesian, Malay, Russian, Arabic, Bulgarian, French, German and (Bosnian).
\par How was matter and time created from nothingness? What does the Big Bang theory signify about the creation of the universe? What is the parallelism between Einstein's Theory of Relativity and the Qur'anic verses?
\par All of these questions are answered in this book. If you want to learn the truths about space, matter, time and fate, read this book. 
\par People who are oppressed, who are tortured to death, innocent babies, those who cannot afford even a loa
f of bread, who must sleep in tents or even in streets in cold weather, those who are massacred just because they belong to a certain tribe, women, children, and old people who are expelled from their homes because of their religion\'85
 Eventually, there is only one solution to the injustice, chaos, terror, massacres, hunger, poverty, and oppression: the values of the Qur'an. 
\par Today, science has proven that the universe was created from nothing with a Big Bang. Moreover, all physical balances of the universe a
re designed to support human life. Everything from the nuclear reactions in stars to the chemical properties of a carbon atom or a water molecule, is created in a glorious harmony. This is the exalted and flawless creation of God, the Lord of All the Worl

\par This book deals with how the theory of evolution is invalidated by scientific findings and experiments in a concise and simple language.
\par Many societies that rebelled again
st the will of God or regarded His messengers as enemies were wiped off the face of the earth completely... Perished Nations examines these penalties as revealed in the verses of the Quran and in light of archaeological discoveries. This book is also avai
lable in German, French, Spanish, Russian, Indonesian and Portuguese. 
\par Fascism and communism, which made humanity suffer dark times, are fed from the same source, on the grounds of which they can attract masses to their side. This source is the materialist 
philosophy and its adaptation to nature, which is Darwinism. The acknowledgement of the scientific invalidity of this theory will bring about the end of all these detrimental ideologies. This book is also available in French.
\par This book gets into detail on 
the issue of origins and makes a comprehensive and technical refutation of Darwinist theory. As it is mentioned in the book, anyone who still defends the theory of evolution has to come into terms with this book and face its challenge. Otherwise, he will

\par The purpose of this book is to warn people against the day on which they will say "If only we did not rebel against God. If only we listened to the messengers\'85

\par Darwin said: "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, s
uccessive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down." When you read this book, you will see that Darwin's theory has absolutely broken down, just as he feared it would. A thorough examination of the feathers of a bird, the sonar system 
of a bat or the wing structure of a fly reveal amazingly complex designs. And these designs indicate that they are created flawlessly by God. The book is also available in Russian.
\par Colours, patterns, spots even lines of each living being existing in nature 
have a meaning. An attentive eye would immediately recognise that not only the living beings, but also everything in nature are just as they should be. Furthermore, he would realise that everything is given to the service of man: the comforting blue colou
r of the sky, the colourful view of flowers, the bright green trees and meadows, the moon and stars illuminating the world in pitch darkness together with innumerable beauties surrounding man. This book is also available in Arabic and Indonesian. 
\par The plan,
 design, and delicate balance existing in our bodies and reaching into even the remotest corners of the incredibly vast universe must surely have a superior Creator. Man is unable to see his Creator yet he can nevertheless grasp His existence, strength, a
nd wisdom by means of his intellect. This book is a summons to think. A summons to ponder over the universe and living beings and see how they have been created flawlessly. The book is also available in Urdu, French and Indonesian.
\par 
\par In the Qur'an, conscienc
e has a meaning and importance beyond its common and everyday use. This book introduces the real concept of conscience that is related in the Qur'an and draws our attention to the kind of understanding, thought, and wisdom that a truly conscientious perso
n has. This book is also available in German and French.
\par There are questions about religion that people seek answers to and hope to be enlightened in the best way. However in most cases, people base their opinions on hearsay rather than acquiring them from 
the real source of religion: the Qur'an. In these booklets, you will find the most accurate answers to all the questions you seek answers for and learn your responsibilities towards your Creator. This book is also available in German. 
\par When the events of "
sickness" and "recovering" take place, our bodies become a battleground in which a bitter struggle is taking place. Microbes invisible to our eyes intrude into our body and begin to increase rapidly. The body however has a mechanism that combats them. Kno
w
n as the "immune system", this mechanism is the most disciplined, most complex and successful army of the world. This system proves that the human body is the outcome of a unique design that has been planned with a great wisdom and skill. In other words, 
the human body is the evidence of a flawless creation, which is the peerless creation of God. This book is also available in Indonesian.
\par Man is a being to which God has granted the faculty of thinking. Yet a majority of people fail to employ this faculty as they should\'85
 The purpose of this book is to summon people to think in the way they should and to guide them in their efforts to think. This book is also available in Indonesian.
\par The unprecedented style and the superior wisdom inherent in the Qur'an is con
clusive evidence confirming that it is the Word of God. Apart from this, there are a number of miracles verifying the fact that the Qur'an is the revelation of God, one of them being that, 1,400 years ago, it declared a number of scientific facts that hav
e only been established thanks to the technological breakthroughs of the 20th century. In this book, in addition to the scientific miracles of the Qur'an, you will also find messages regarding the future. }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

\par The world is a temporary place specially created by God to test man. That is why, it is inherently flawed and far from satisfying man's endless needs and desires. Each and every attraction existing in the world eventuall
y wears out, becomes corrupt, decays and finally disappears. This is the never-changing reality of life. This book explains this most important essence of life and leads man to ponder the real place to which he belongs, namely the Hereafter.
\par The content of
 this book is an extremely important truth that astounded large numbers of people, and caused their outlook on life to change drastically. We can sum up this reality like this: "All events, people, buildings, cities, cars, places, which are a part of our 
life in this world, in short, everything we see, hold, touch, smell, taste and hear, are actually illusions and sensations that form in our brain."
\par The purpose of this book is to display the miraculous features of plants and hence to make people see "the creation miracle" in things -they often encounter in the flow of their daily lives and sidestep. 
\par This book opens new horizons on
 these issues for people who, throughout their lives, -think only about their own needs and hence fail to see the evidence of God's existence. Reading and understanding this book will be an important step in coming to an understanding of one's Creator.

\par T
he information hidden inside DNA controls the thousands of different events that take place in the cells of the human body and in the functioning of its systems, as well as all the physical features, from the colour of a person's hair and eyes to his heig

\par Just as a tiny key opens a huge door, this book will open new horizons for its readers. And the reality behind that do
or is the most important reality that one can come across in one's lifetime. Relating the amazing and admirable features of spiders known by few people and asking the questions of "how" and "why" in the process, this book reveals the excellence and perfec
tion inherent in God's creation. 
\par In societies distant from religion, right is often presented as wrong, and vice versa. Unbecoming behaviour which will not please God may be favoured and encouraged. Romanticism is one of those wrong sentiments which is ass
umed to be "right". This book reveals what a serious threat romanticism \endash  which is imagined to be a simple character trait \endash  poses to societies and individuals, and shows how easy it is to eliminate this danger.
\par These millimeter-sized animals that we frequ
ently come across but don't care much about have an excellent ability for organization and specialization that is not to be matched by any other being on earth. These aspects of ants create in one a great admiration for God's superior power and unmatched 
creation. The book is also available inUrdu and Indonesian.
\par This book maintains that the source of the scourge of terrorism does not come from a divine religion, and that there is no room for terrorism in Islam. It is revealed, in the light of the verses of
 the Koran and with examples from history, that Islam forbids terrorism and aims to bring peace and security to the world. }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Islam Denounces Terrorism}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

\par This book is about the enthusiasm of believers that keeps growing until the en

\par That people do not adopt the moral values of the Qur'an and submit to God u
nderlie the personal and social depression, pain, fears and lack of confidence that is widely experienced today. This book explains the detriments that disbelief gives to people and discloses the only way to salvation, which is submission to God.
\par The plan,
 design, and delicate balance existing in our bodies and reaching into even the remotest corners of the incredibly vast universe must surely have a superior Creator. Man is unable to see his Creator yet he can nevertheless grasp His existence, strength, a
nd wisdom by means of his intellect. This book is a summons to think. A summons to ponder over the universe and living beings and see how they have been created flawlessly.
\par Scientific progress makes it clear that living beings have an extremely complex stru
cture and an order that is too perfect to have come into being by accident. Recently, for example, the perfect structure in the human gene became a top issue as a result of the completion of the Human Genome Project. In this book, the unique creation of G
od is once again disclosed for all to see. 
\par Moses is the prophet whose life is most narrated in the Qur'an. The Qur'an provides a very detailed account of his struggle with Pharaoh, the unfavourable conduct of his people and the way the Prophet Moses summon

\par 
\par Fascism is an ideology that has brought great disasters to humanity. Not only has it caused millions of people to
 be killed and tortured simply because of their race, but it has also attempted to abolish all human values. The main purpose of the book is to present various fascist tendencies which appear under different methods and guises, and expose their real origi
ns and objectives. The book also attempts to tear down the mask of fascism, and reveal that fascism is definitely an anti-religionist system. 
\par The Qur'an has been revealed to us so that we may read and ponder. The Basic Concepts of the Qur'an is a useful re
source prepared as a guide to thinking. Some basic Islamic concepts like the soul, conscience, wisdom, loyalty, submission to God, brotherhood, modesty, prayer, patience, are discussed in the light of Qur'anic verses. This book is also available in Portug
uese. 
\par The way to examine the universe and all the beings therein and to discover God's art of creation and announce it to humanity is "science". Therefore, religion adopts science as a way to reach the details of God's creation and therefore encourages sci
ence. Just as religion encourages scientific research, so does scientific research that is guided by the facts communicated by religion yield very repid and definite results. This is because religion is the unique source that provides the most correct and
 definite answer to the question of how the universe and life came into being. This book is also available in Russian.
\par One of the principal deceptions that impels people into delinquency and makes them pursue their own desires is their heedlessness of death
. Both human beings and the universe they live in are mortal. What awaits the disbelievers in the next world is more dreadful: the eternal wrath of hell. This book, based on the verses of the Qur'an, makes a detailed depiction of the moment of death, the 
day of judgement, and the penalties in hell, and it sounds a warning about the great danger facing us. }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Death Resurrection Hell}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  is also available in Polish. 
\par The most serious mistake a man makes is not pondering. It is not possible to find the truth unless o
ne thinks about basic questions such as "How and why am I here?", "Who created me?", or "Where am I going?." Failing to do so, one becomes trapped in the vicious circle of daily life and turns into a selfish creature caring only for himself. }{
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Ever Thought About the Truth?}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188  summons people to think on such basic questions and to discover the real meaning of life. This bookis also available in French.
\par In this book you will find explanations about eternity, timelessness and spacelessness that you will never have 
encountered anywhere else and you will be confronted by the reality that eternity has already begun. The real answers to many questions people always ponder such as the true nature of death, resurrection after death, the existence of an eternal life, and 
the time when all these things will happen are to be found here\'85 
\par Never plead ignorance of God's evident existence, that everything was created by God, that everything you own was given to you by God for your subsistence, that you will not stay so long in t
his world, of the reality of death, that the Qur'an is the Book of truth, that you will give account for your deeds, of the voice of your conscience that always invites you to righteousness, of the existence of the hereafter and the day of account, that h
ell is the eternal home of severe punishment, and of the reality of fate. 
\par One of the principal deceptions that impel people into delinquency is the fact that they constantly forget the basic facts of life. This book summons man to remember facts that his soul prompts him to forget. 
\par While watching television or reading the paper, you see many items which you would not like to see or hear: destitute people, murders, quarrels, ill-treatment, and much more... Certainly, you, too, would like to live in a peacef
ul and secure society where people live in harmony and friendship. However just waiting for such a world to come about by itself one day is of no use. This book is a summons to those who want goodness to prevail: it calls on them to do goodness and to for
m an alliance with other good people like themselves.
\par The Qur'an has been sent down as a book easily understandable to everyone. Everyone who believes in God and follows his conscience can take counsel from the verses of the Qur'an and obey the commands in 
the verses. However, those who follow their lower self fail to measure God with His true scale, entertain doubts about the hereafter, interpret the verses of the Qur'an wrongly in their own crooked reasoning. In this book, the reasons why those who do not
 use their intellect misinterpret the Qur'an are examined and some examples of the unwise interpretations and objections they make concerning the verses are reviewed and answered.
\par In the Qur'an, God tells people many secrets. People who are unaware of these
 secrets experience the trouble and distress caused by this throughout their lives. For those who learn these secrets of the Qur'an, however, the life of this world is very easy, and full of joy and excitement. This book deals with the subjects God relate
d to people as a secret.
\par "Everything that constitutes our life is a totality of perceptions received by our soul. The things, people, places and events that make our world and our lives meaningful are like a dream; we perceive them only as images in our bra
in, and have nothing to do with their truth or reality\'85"
\par In the book, which consists of a conversation between four people, the prejudices that prevent people from understanding this great truth are removed, and the misconceptions they have are explained.
\par Driven by pride and arrogance, man forgets that he is solely a servant of God. The first representative of arrogance is Satan, who rebelled against God. Throughout history, people who out of their pride worshipped themselves, have been mimicking the arrog
ance of Satan.
\par Everyone has some knowledge and convictions about Islam. However, the majority of these convictions have their origins in inadequate or incorrect sources. Actually, what one has to do to know Islam is to study the Qur'an, w
hich comprises the origin and basis of Islam. Based on the information conveyed in the Qur'an, this book gives an account of God's attributes, our purpose in this world, what we have to do to fulfill this purpose. 
\par God, in the Qur'an, calls the culture of 
people who are not subject to the religion of God "ignorance." Only a comparison of this culture with the honourable thoughts and moral structure of the Qur'an can reveal its primitive and corrupted nature. The purpose of this book is to take this compari
son further, displaying the extent of the "crude understanding" of ignorant societies. 
\par God createsevery word one utters, and every event one experiences, from the moment one is born into tis world. For a believer who understands this fact, uninterrupted jo
y of faith becomes an unchanging quality of life. The fate decreed by God is flawless. In this entity made up of millions of events, there is only goodness, benevolence, and wisdom for everyone who looks at them with an eye for goodness.
\par In order for justi
ce to reign on the Earth, a morality that will make people leave their own interests aside in favour of justice is needed. This morality is the Qur'anic morality that God teaches and commands us. In Surat an-Nisa, God commands believers to act justly, alb
eit against themselves. The purpose of this book is to describe the true justice in the Qur'an.
\par In this book, all ideologies based on disbelief are referred to as "the religions of irreligion." That is simply because these ideologies have in time evolved to
 become religions with a complete system of beliefs, practices, and rules for conducting one's daily life.
\par 
\par A Muslim's life is described as follows in the Qur'an: "Truly, my prayer and my worship, my life and my death, are (all) for God" (The Qur'an, 6:162
) A believer who decides to live for the cause of God must abandon all the idols of the society of ignorance }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188 Devoted to God}{\f0\fs22\insrsid7605516\charrsid12877188

\par Darwin's theory of evolution maintained that all living beings emerged as a result of chance coincidence and thus denied Creation. Yet, different branches of science like biochemistry, genetics, and palaeontology have demonstrat

e site is to reveal the manifestations of the Qur'anic verses which give an account of these events and prove once more that the Qur'an is the word of Allah. Besides, it is also intended that all these incidents, each of which is an "example to their own 
time", can serve as a "warning".

\par The end times refer to a period very close to the Day of Judgment, when the morality of the Qur'an will come to prevail and people all over the world will come to live by it. When we compare what is happening today with the signs of the end times we can s
e
e a great many indications that we are currently living in the end times and that also give the good news of the approach of the Golden Age. The aim of this site is to encourage people to think about this aspect of the end times, and to share that joy and
 excitement with one another.
