\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, thei

lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the fi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 al Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uch as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Sp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
om loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in th

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be p

While a believer decides on what clothes he is going to wear during the day and gets dressed, he is aware of an important fact: that clothing is one of Allah's countless blessings and there is good reason for its existence. Everyone benefits from this ble

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and silk clothing. The articles of clothing we use, almost every moment of our lives, are obtained from plants and animals that are wonders of creation. In other words, if Allah had not created some living things with the ability to provide human beings w

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Despite the fact that they know this, some people either ignore it or, because of the error of their ways, don't appreciate the blessings they have. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Because they were given the clothes they need from the minute they were born, dressing has become a habit for them. This habit prevents them from realising that their clothing is a blessing and from giving thanks for it. But one of the reasons why our Lor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  created blessings in this word is that human beings would thank Him for them. So, let's examine the reasons why Allah created clothing for us beginning with the benefits it provides us.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Clothing is like a shield that protects the human body from cold, the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 dangerous rays of the sun and minor dangers such as cuts and bruises from our environment. If we didn't have clothing, the thin skin that covers the human body would often be injured by these kinds of small accidents. They are painful, a threat to health

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As in every sphere, so in trade and commerce, the Qur'an brings what is finest, easiest and most true into human life. In this way, it helps people away from s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tress and depression and makes it possible for them to work in a healthy and peaceful environment where they can submit themselves to Allah, take right action, and consult with others in making decisions.

 work-life making both short and long term plans and mapping out the various stages. And after he has begun the work, he will definitely calculate the further stages, what measures will ensure him success in the long run and possible alternatives. And he

ased and where they even want to die to avoid the pain, although they have already died and cannot die again. In some respects, the Fire could be compared to the world as depicted in films after a nuclear war. However, the darkness described in these film
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the following examples we can show another possible reflection on filthy uncared for places: a place may be dirty because of a person's forgetfulness or neglect. However, as soon as the believer sees th

otect every blessing given to him meticulously and show his thanks to Allah in the work he does. Otherwise, he will be acting in a way that does not earn Allah's approval. A believer who is aware of this will immediately understand where he went wrong and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 so turn to Allah; he will do the cleaning that has to be done, make up for his mistakes and not fall into the same error again.

There is only one way to escape being lost in the endless punishment of the Fire: living according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah, for by means of these Allah grants to human beings "their Reminder". It saves people from the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 ignorance in which they are sunk, their primitive way of thinking, stressful environments, negative character traits, baseless fears, perverse beliefs, and the torments of the Fire for which all these things are the causes. In place of these they gain un
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 erstanding and wisdom, higher values, a sane environment filled with peace of mind and, most importantly, life in the Garden filled with endless blessings.

Living according to the Qur'an and the Sunnah as a defence against injustice, conflict, inequality, envy, war, unfairness, waste, fear, bigotry, cruelty, violence, immorality and other such things is the most basic solution for human beings in order fo

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Despite this, and because they have turned their backs on true deen for the sake of small gains, worldly profit and human weakness, some people inflict great harm on themselves. For a human being to\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 turn his back on the Qur'an and Sunnah means that he will remain unaware of truths that are vital for him to know. However, the resources that he and transitory human beings like him have collected will not be enough to survive in the situations and prob

ems that they encounter in the world. People like him will spend their whole lives in anxiety, worry, stress, fear and adversity, with no solution to their problems. And later, they will accept this situation and will spend the rest of their lives deceive
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , thinking that their suffering is a "fact of life" when it is actually a punishment for not living by the deen.
