ra in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-relate
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Harun Yahya's works, translat\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ed into 57 different languages, constitute a collection for a total of more than 45,000 pages with 30,000 illustrations.

ir peoples' lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the Final Scripture) and Prophet Muhammad (may God bless him and grant him peace), last of the prophets. Under the gu
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
dance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet [may God bless him and grant him peace]), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of irreligious ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence th
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet (may God bless him and grant him peace), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's existence and unity and the Hereafter; and to expose irreligious systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, Spain to Brazil, Malaysia to Italy, France to Bulgaria and Russia. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,

over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ... No matter how different their conditions may be, all play host to a wide range of life forms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Everyone knows that our a planet contains a teeming variety of life. Yet most people may never have reflected on this astonishing state of affairs, nor consid\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ered the great importance of this variety and how it must have come into being. They may never have thought of the need to reflect on these things. Now, putting aside for a moment the perspective stemming from familiarity, try to imagine a world without a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l these living things you know about.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 First, picture an Earth in which there are no terrestrial or marine plants, no forests, and no trees. You will soon come to an obvious conclusion: Were it not for plants that perform photosynthesis every day, the oxyge
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n essential for life would not be replenished, and for that reason, there would be no life on Earth apart from a few bacteria.

 world that we cannot see, there is still one indisputable fact: Life without them is inconceivable. Because the production of a large part of the oxygen in the atmosphere, its elemental cycles, the cleansing of the Earth and the breakdown of dead organis
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s into re-usable substances and many other vital processes are all due to these microscopic creatures. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Vertebrates, mollusks, arthropods, crustaceans and dozens of other plant and animal groups play an important role in the ecological balance in the seas,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 forests and land. Were any of these to be absent, the processing of dead organisms into new sources of food would be interrupted, the soil would become unproductive, the food chain would be damaged. Habitats would disappear and as a result, all animals, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 lants and humans would disappear from the face of the Earth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 We could cite more examples, but the lesson is always the same: Humanity could not survive in the absence of other living things. Plants, animals, fungi and bacteria\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in short, all the millions of
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  living species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are at the service of human beings. In the face of this miraculous state of affairs, a number of questions spring to mind:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 How did the unimaginable variety of life on Earth come into being?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 How did these living things that enchant our souls\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  with their matchless beauty and meet all our needs with the characteristics they possess, come into existence?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 How do these millions of living species live in such perfect harmony with their surroundings and with one another?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To whom do the flawless featu\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 res in each and every species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 estimated to number around 100 million\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 actually belong?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionists seek to answer these questions, and account for the origin and variety of life, by means of the theory of evolution. They claim that life came into being fr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
om inanimate substances, by chance and over the course of time; and that the variety of life in some way arose from single-celled organisms, as the result of natural phenomena and random factors. Many evolutionists have supported these claims ever since C
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 arles Darwin first published his theory, and have offered so-called proofs with which to back them up. However, scientific discoveries have refuted the theory of evolution time and again. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 There are innumerable questions to which Darwinism is unable to pro\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
vide any rational and scientific answers. One of the greatest problems facing evolution is the extraordinary variety of living things, and the origin of these species on Earth. The realization that there are insuperable genetic barriers between species, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e sudden emergence of life forms in the fossil record, and the fact that living things possess organs and systems that are wondrous marvels of design unmatched by even the most advanced 21st century technological progress, have all demolished evolutionist
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 claims. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Rather than admitting their mistakes, most evolutionists have tried to salvage the situation by means of imaginary fairy-tale scenarios. Yet evolutionists have no answer to the question of speciation, which Charles Darwin described as the "mystery
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  of mysteries" 1 and to which he long sought an answer. And that despite the intervening 150 years and all their intense efforts! 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 On the other hand, anyone looking in a sincere, unprejudiced way can clearly see that we live in a miraculous environment. Th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ose bacteria, animals and plants that give rise to such ideal conditions cannot have come into being by chance. The fact is, every species on Earth is the product of a sublime creation. From their proteins and cells to their organs and systems, they carry
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
messages that reveal the glory of their creation. Every living species points to the existence of an Almighty, Omniscient Creator possessed of an infinite artistry and intelligence. That Creator is God, Lord of the worlds.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The fact that God has created all\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  living things and placed them at the disposal of man is revealed in the Qur'an. Some verses in Surat an-Nahl refer to this: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 He created the heavens and the Earth with truth. He is exalted above anything they associate with Him. He created man from a drop \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of sperm and yet He is an open challenger! And He created livestock. There is warmth for you in them, and various uses and some you eat. And there is beauty in them for you in the evening when you bring them home and in the morning when you drive them out
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
to graze. They carry your loads to lands you would never reach except with great difficulty. Your Lord is All-Gentle, Most Merciful. And horses, mules and donkeys both to ride and for adornment. And He creates other things you do not know. The Way should 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ead to God, but there are those who deviate from it. If He had wished He could have guided every one of you. It is He Who sends down water from the sky. From it you drink and from it come the shrubs among which you graze your herds. And by it He makes cro
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s grow for you and olives and dates and grapes and fruit of every kind. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who reflect. He has made night and day subservient to you, and the sun and moon and stars, all subject to His command. There are certainly
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Signs in that for people who use their intellect. And also the things of varying colors He has created for you in the Earth. There is certainly a Sign in that for people who pay heed. It is He Who made the sea subservient to you so that you can eat fresh 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lesh from it and bring out from it ornaments to wear. And you see the ships cleaving through it so that you can seek His bounty, and so that hopefully you will show thanks. He cast firmly embedded mountains on the Earth so it would not move under you, and
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rivers and pathways so that hopefully you would be guided, and landmarks. And they are guided by the stars. Is He Who creates like Him who does not create? So will you not pay heed? If you tried to number God's blessings, you could never count them. God i
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  Ever-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (Surat an-Nahl, 3-18)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Obviously the variety of life is a very considerable subject to be dealt with in a single volume. This book describes the general outlines of that variety and what it provides us with. It recalls some o
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f the blessings too many to be listed, even in general terms. In addition, it sets out some of the verses about living things, and indications of the existence and attributes of God, as described in Qur'an: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 And in your creation and all the creatures He ha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s spread about there are Signs for people with certainty. (Surat al-Jathiyya, 4)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One aim of this book is to show how irrational and unscientific are evolutionist claims concerning the richness of life, and to invalidate such Darwinist concepts as speciatio\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n and macro-evolution. Separate chapters are devoted to the Galapagos finches and industrial melanism, which evolutionists portrayed as fundamental proofs at every opportunity. Scientific facts describe how these tales constitute no evidence of evolution

Life can be found just about everywhere on Earth, whether it's visible or not. Almost no place is without life forms of some kind. A vast number of species live in a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As Dr. G. David Tilman, Professor of Ecology from University of Minnesota puts it, "The most striking feature of Earth is the existence of life, and the most striking feature of life is its diversity."2
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To describe the variety and richn\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ess of life on our plant, scientists use a special term: Biodiversity. This term was adopted from biological diversity and includes animals, plants, fungi and micro-organisms\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in short, all living things.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The term biodiversity is now widely employed, but co\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ntrary to what is often imagined, it has only recently become a familiar term. No matter how far back in history one researches the variety of life, the special term of biodiversity entered scientific circles only in 1986. That year, the concept was born 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t the Biodiversity Symposium held by the American National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution.3 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Following that, there was a rapid increase in initiatives drawing attention to the importance of biological diversity and the need to protect \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
it. Following the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Regeneration, held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, biodiversity became one of the subjects of joint concern for all the countries of the world.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 How many species are there on Earth? That question has long intrigued a great many people. Wide-ranging research is now being carried out to answer it. To date,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 scientific studies have revealed that no definite figure can be given, only that it is exceedingly large. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The eminent zoologist Edward O. Wilson, one of the scientists who first came up with the concept of biodiversity, is regarded as an authority in the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 field.4 A professor at Harvard University, he offers the following analysis: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No one knows the number of species of living organisms, but there are probably at least 5 million, and the number could be as high as 100 million. Consider first the question of\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 the amount of biodiversity. The number of species of organisms on Earth is unknown to the nearest order of magnitude. About 1.5 million species have been given names to date, but the actual number is likely to lie somewhere between 10 and 100 million.5 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 homas E. Lovejoy is President of the H. John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment and an expert on biodiversity: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 While the number of species currently described is on the order of 1.4 million, the big question is how many species ar\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In a paper, Professor Quentin Wheeler of Natural History Museum, London and Professor Joel Cracraft of the American Museum of Natural History submitted their own es\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 timate of biodiversity: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Despite having accumulated significant knowledge about the world's species over the past 2 centuries, we still cannot provide accurate answers to the simplest of all questions about biodiversity. How many species are there? Estimat
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 es vary from 3 to 100 million species.7 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Taylor Ricketts of Stanford University says that: "The Earth is home to over 1.7 million known species, and probably 10 times that number have yet to be discovered."8
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Alessandro Minelli from the University of Padua \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
states that "Global estimates of existing biodiversity are thus quite uncertain. Figures ranging from 5 to 130 million species have been recently offered for the gross total."9
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 According to The Encarta Encyclopedia, the identified and named species number \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
1.75 million, and some scientists estimate the total number of species on Earth to be around 10 millionand others, more than 100 million.10 According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, many more species are waiting to be identified and named, and there are c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rrently estimated to be between 10 and 30 million living species.11

and describing all species is unattainable.13
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Two researchers from London's Imperial College, Andy Purvis and Andy Hector, published an article in Nature magazine titled "Getting the Measure of Biodiversity." They emphasized the point that computer databas
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
es and internet technology have prepared far more comprehensive species lists than ever before; and that trillions of bytes of information have been collected together in data banks. However, all this information is no more than "a small drop in the ocean
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 " as Purvis and Hector put it.14
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 But the really impressive thing is not just the total number and diversity of species. Within each species, there are also a large number of variations. For instance, all dogs belong to the single species of Canis familiari
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s. But in addition, there are hundreds of diverse breeds with different appearances, sizes, body structures, colors, and forms of behavior.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Another phenomenon is that some animal species exhibit different body structures at different periods in their lives\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
. During its pupa, larva and adult stages for example, a butterfly or moth exhibits an enormous variety in terms of structure, size, color, life style, behavior and biological systems. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Anyone realizing the wealth of biodiversity on Earth needs to ask \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 an important question: How did such a variety of life emerge?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This question has always given evolutionists a major headache, and will always continue to do so. Writing a so-called evolutionary scenario for even a single species is a major problem for Darwi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nism, and the evolution of millions of species is an irresolvable one. People who set aside preconceptions on the other hand, clearly understand that all living species came into being by the wish and creation of God, Lord of the worlds. This is the sole 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 xplanation for the magnificent diversity of species, and looking for any other is a waste of time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No matter how much large, attractive animals like birds, reptiles and mammals attract notice, insects are actually the group with the greatest diversity. Acc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ording to contemporary findings, insects represent over two-thirds of the total number of species on Earth.15 Approximately 1 million species belonging to this group have been named and described so far.16 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As research deepens, brand- new scientific discov\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Other studies are being carried out to identify as yet unknown species. Thousands of scientists from many countries, particularly the USA, are now researching the species on Earth. The total budget set aside for this en

st century science. Diana Wall, a professor at Colorado State University and Director of the International Biodiversity Observation Year Management Board, summarizes the importance of this research:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Scientists have described about 1.75 million species, but\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 we estimate that there are over 12 million species still to be described. For 99% of species we simply don't have good information on their distribution, abundance, whether they are plentiful or endangered, or their role in providing goods and services t

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Exploring biodiversity will unlock many benefits, through discovery of new genes and chemicals that can be used for drugs, to improve crops, or \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
to restore polluted land. Perhaps even more importantly, learning where species are, their role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, and how we can conserve them will be vital for making more informed decisions about our land, rivers and oceans.22
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A new stud\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
y initiated in this field is the All Species project.23 Eminent biodiversity experts such as Edward Wilson and Peter Raven are involved in this project, whose aim is to name and describe all species, and to prepare an Internet page for each one. This proj
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ct is far more complex than other studies being carried out in the world of science, and a much wider-ranging one than the Human Genome project, as was made clear in the 26 October 2001 issue of Science magazine. According to All Species Project researche
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s' estimates, it will cost some $20 billion to establish a data bank of all species.24 This cost alone is enough to give an idea of the project's size.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 It therefore seems certain that increasing research will permit us to discover previously unknown specie\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

still have a long way to go. As Professor Wilson has pu\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Remember, some 1.75 million known species have yet to \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
be set out and classified according to scientific criteria. As stated by Professor Minelli, "There are serious problems, indeed, even with that part of biological diversity that has been already described and named."27 Another researcher, John Alroy of Ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ifornia University, says that in all likelihood, one-fifth of all species names in the scientific literature are invalid.28
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 According to World Resources Institute experts, we know more about the numbers of stars in space than those of the species on Earth.\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
29 Norman Myers, an eminent Oxford university environmentalist, expresses this in another way: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 While biodiversity, and indeed life itself, is the key characteristic of our planet, we know more about the total numbers of atoms in the universe than about Ea\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rth's complement of species.30
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Another scientist to express this is Nigel E. Stork, Director of the James Cook University Tropical Rain Forest Ecology and Management Research Centre. Professor Stork says that the data regarding biodiversity are highly defi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cient:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
In recent years biologists have come to recognize just how little we know about the organisms with which we share the planet Earth. In particular, attempts to determine how many species there are in total have been surprisingly fruitless... What the
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
se arguments show is how little we actually know about some of the fundamental aspects of the biology and distribution of organisms. We cannot say how widespread species are, we do not know the size of the species pool, and we do not know how specific spe
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ies are to a particular habitat, type of soil, type of forest, or, in some cases, a species of tree. 31
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To summarize, the distribution, densities, positions in their habitats and levels of genetic variety of most named species are not yet known for cer\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
tain.32 Furthermore, the great majority of existing species have not yet been described. Despite all our efforts, we know only a very small part of the magnificent variety of life on Earth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As you shall see in the chapters that follow, this magnificent ric\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hness of species definitively refutes the theory of evolution, which claims that living things came into being as the result of chance, and proves one single fact in a way that permits no doubt: Creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The glorious richness of life on Earth is the resul\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t of a very special creation that belongs only to God, the Almighty and Omniscient. His creation of all things is revealed in various verses:}{

ysical surroundings. Lakes, forests, and coral reefs, together with the living things they harbor, are all examples of ecosystems. Lake Baikal in Siberia, for instance, is an ecosystem containing 1,500 plant and animal species.33 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Each ecosystem has its ow\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n unique variety of life. For example, there are dozens of species of trees in a typical North American forest, and hundreds in a South American rain forest.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The point to be emphasized is that any balanced, healthy ecosystem hosts a wide spectrum of living\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 species. A large number of species are linked to one another within a very complex interconnected system, and these play a greater or smaller part in the balanced functioning of the ecosystem as a whole\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
so much so that sometimes, the absence of a single \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
pecies can impair an entire system and damage its equilibrium. For example, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, otters in the Northwest American and Western Canadian coasts were hunted almost to the point of extinction. The otters fed on sea urchin
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, and when these mammals practically disappeared, sea urchins multiplied rapidly and began damaging seaweed beds. Damage to the seaweed had a harmful effect on several species of fish and invertebrates in those same waters and led to a decline in their nu
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 bers. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Toward the end of the 20th century, when otters were made a protected species, the seaweed began increasing, and balance in the region was re-established.34
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Many more similar cases have been observed, helping us to understand that species spend thei\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r lives in perfect harmony with each other and with their surroundings.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 But the term extraordinarily complex utterly fails to do justice to the complexity of the system constituted by the glorious variety of life on Earth. To obtain a closer understanding \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
of this, consider the following: Even if all scientists work together, combining all our accumulated technological and scientific knowledge and material means, not even the smallest imitation of one of these systems can be produced. Professor Wilson says 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hat it is totally impossible for scientists to collect species beforehand from a rain forest about to be cut down and to introduce them all somewhere else: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The biologists cannot accomplish this task, not if thousands of them came with a billion-dollar bud\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
get. They cannot even imagine how to do it. In the forest patch live legions of species: perhaps 300 birds, 500 butterflies, 200 ants, 50,000 beetles, 1,000 trees, 5,000 fungi, tens of thousands of bacteria and so on down a long roster of major groups. Ea
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
h species occupies a precise niche, demanding a certain place, an exact microclimate, particular nutrients and temperature and humidity cycles with specified timing to trigger phases of the life cycle. Many, perhaps most, of the species are locked in symb
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 oses with other species; they cannot survive and reproduce unless arrayed with their partners in the correct idiosyncratic configurations. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Even if the biologists pulled off the taxonomic equivalent of the Manhattan Project, sorting and preserving cultures\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 of all the species, they could not then put the community back together again. It would be like unscrambling an egg with a pair of spoons. 35
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 From Professor Wilson's statements, you can see that no ecosystem can ever be established using human intelligenc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e and knowledge. Therefore, it is totally impossible for ecosystems to come into being through blind chance, as evolutionists maintain. The following statement by the well-known Professor of Botany Karl Niklas from Cornell University is significant:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 I don'\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t think that the ecological patterns that we see surfacing in fossils and living organisms and across the continents are a consequence of chance.36
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Ecosystems operating in perfect harmony are no doubt manifest proofs of the fact of Creation and the existen\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Clearly, we, too, would be unable to survive. Even if we mobilized advanced technology and our entire material means, we could never establish the balances and conditions essential to our survival. The latest scie
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ntific research to confirm this fact was the Biosphere 2 Project, regarded as the largest and most complex closed study area used in ecological research to date.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This project aimed to establish an ecosystem that would provide a habitat for eight people, pl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ants and animals for a two-year period in a closed area of 13,000 square meters (15,550 square yards) in size.37 The system contained "rooms" resembling such natural ecosystems as agricultural areas, forests and seas. However, the project was a failure, w
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ich disappointed a great many scientists. Joel Cohen of Rockefeller University and David Tilman of Minnesota University described the result of this initiative in an article in Science magazine: 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Despite the enormous resources invested in the original desi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
gn and construction (estimated at roughly $200 million from 1984 to 1991), and despite a multimillion-dollar operating budget, it proved impossible to create a materially closed system that could support eight human beings with adequate food, water, and a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
r for 2 years. The management of Biosphere 2 encountered numerous unexpected problems and surprises, even though almost unlimited energy and technology were available to support Biosphere 2 from the outside. 38
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Some of the unexpected problems that emerged \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
in the facility between 1991 and 1993 and made life impossible included a drop in oxygen levels to 14%, sudden rises in the carbon dioxide concentration, a rise in the amount of nitric oxide sufficient to cause brain damage, the disappearance of most of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e living species (including 19 of 25 vertebrate species and all pollinators brought into the enclosure, which would have ensured the eventual extinction of most of the plant species as well), water pollution, excessive algae, and population explosion of c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 azy ants, cockroaches and katydids.39
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, despite all the efforts made, it proved impossible to produce in the closed Biosphere 2 system the balances that have been operating for millions of years on Earth, and thus it was impossible to establish an 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 environment habitable for humans, animals and plants. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In conclusion, Professor Cohen and Professor Tilman summarized the lesson to be learned from the project: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No one yet knows how to engineer systems that provide humans with the life supporting services\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  that natural ecosystems produce for free.40

Whenever tropical rain forests are mentioned, the first things that come to mind are dazzling butterflies, unusual-looking insects, and large, broad-leaved, trees. Rai\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n forests are found in regions close to the equator and consist of dense trees that are always green and very tall. These forests' most important feature is the}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{

 of square kilometers in size, is home to a wide variety of species.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Around 250 years ago, the first European researchers to set foot in the rain forests of South America were astonished by the variety of life they encountered. Each new study again reveale\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d the diversity of plant and animal species.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A rain forest in the tropical belt has very different characteristics from those of other forests. For one thing, underneath the very tall trees 50 meters (164 feet) high, there are medium-sized ones, such as pa
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lm, cedar, mahogany and figs. The trunks and branches of these are covered in bright orchids, cacti, ferns and mosses. The lowest layer in the forest, the grass layer, consists of a dense vegetation covering and hosts a great variety of insect, bacteria a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d fungi species. In short, a rain forest's most characteristic feature is the variety of life that so amazes us.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Rain forests comprise just 7% of the land surface, yet contain more than 50% of the plant and animal species on Earth. Researchers also state t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hat this last percentage may change as we learn more about biodiversity. The well-known Smithsonian Institute researcher Thomas Lovejoy makes a very apposite statement: "The larger point is that the more people look at the tropical forest in different way
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , as Terry Erwin has done, the more biodiversity there seems to be."41
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 So that you can envision the diversity in question. One hectare (10,000 square meters, or 11,960 square yards) of tropical rain forest can contain more than 600 different species of tre\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
es.42 In one region of the Amazon Basin, 440 species of butterfly can be collected in a single day.43 Forty-three separate species of ants44 and 650 different species of insect can be found on a single tree.45 In this same region, one can also encounter h
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ndreds of species of bird in a 1-kilometer (1,094-yard) area of forest. Taking ten species of tree in Borneo as an example, there are more than 2,800 different arthropods on them.46 The number of insect species living in tropical forests is estimated to b
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  in the millions.47
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
These numbers do not represent the total number of living organisms in a particular habitat, just the number of species. Another astonishing fact is that in tropical rain forests, according to some experts, millions or even tens of mill
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ions of living things live in complete harmony and co-operation..
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Soil in tropical rain forests is generally thought of as being rich and fertile. Recently, however, it has been realized that this is not so. In terms of nutrients, the soil is poor, compare\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d to that of other forests.48 How did such a great variety of plants emerge from poor soil? The answer lies in the perfection of the rain forest ecosystem.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The biodiversity in tropical forests has been created as a whole, and is based on very delicate, com\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
plementary balances. For instance, consider the micro-organisms, minute insects and fungi living on the forest floor. Their dimensions are very small in comparison to the trees and animals, yet they are responsible for cleaning the forest and making the s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
il productive. They break down dead animals and leaves and branches that fall from the trees, recycling them back into the ecosystem. In this way, nothing is wasted. Professor Wilson describes the importance of this mechanism: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The leafcutters and other ki\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nds of ants, together with bacteria, fungi, termites and mites, process most of the dead vegetation and return its nutrients to the plants to keep the great tropical forests alive. 49
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 We still do not know how many millions of species live in tropical rain \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
forests, but we do know that every species has a different task and importance in these ecosystems, and that these species live together in harmony. This is expressed in an article about Amazon rain forests in the Turkish magazine Bilim ve Teknik ("Scienc
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and Technique"):
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
The continuity of species in this Amazon Basin's complex ecosystem is based on their close dependence on one another. Every species, be it plant or animal, contributes to part of this system with its millions of components. Trees, the epi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
phytes on trees, fungi, monkeys, vampire bats, eagles, parrots, the crocodiles, piranha fish and lilies in the river, and micro-organisms invisible to the naked eye all make different contributions to the giant ecosystem in which they live. There are very
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 delicate balances here. The rain forest exists together with all these species. The disappearance of a single species will damage several of these balances. 50
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Indeed, such great harmony and interdependence exist among some species in the forest that one c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
annot survive in the absence of the other. Some 90% of the trees in the rain forest need animals to spread their seeds,51 while insect larvae, caterpillars, birds and other animals feed on the seeds of these trees. For example, species of fig tree and fig
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
fly species are so interdependent that either cannot survive in isolation from the other. In the absence of fig flies, fig trees cannot fertilize themselves, and in the absence of fig trees, fig flies are deprived of their natural habitat. There is a diff
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rent species of fig fly for every one of the more than 900 species of fig tree in tropical regions!52
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Traits such as the fig fly's body and mouth structure and the flower's structure and reproductive organs, as well as the insect's flights and the times wh\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
en the flowers open are in complete harmony. Accounting for this utter dependence between species has always been difficult for Darwinism. For this phenomenon, there is only one explanation: The harmony between plants and animals is a marvel of Creation. 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 here is no chance of this system developing over time through small random changes and the mindless mechanisms of evolution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Take, for example, the harmonious existence of the hawk moth Xanthopan morganii and one species of Madagascar orchid. To collect n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ectar, this moth extends its proboscis, some 30 to 35 centimeters (11 to 13 inches) in length, around 30 centimeters (11 inches) deep into the body of the orchid, and thus enables it to be fertilized.53 In order to reach and fertilize the ovary at this de
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 th, the moth needs a proboscis of just such a length, In other words, the two species must be totally compatible with one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This represents a major dilemma for evolutionists, because it is impossible for these two different species to have undergon\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e a parallel process of evolution, much less at the same time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Let us assume that the ancestors of the Madagascar orchid and the Xanthopan morganii moth had had, respectively, much shorter nectary and a much shorter proboscis. (This is the assumption that \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
must be made, according to the theory of evolution.) In that case, both species would have extended their parts simultaneously. The hawk moth and the orchid, would each have been exposed to mutations that simultaneously extended the length of their probos
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
is and nectary. Of course, such mutations would have had only advantageous effects on these two life forms (and beneficial mutations have never been observed). They would have to out-multiply other members of their species that had not undergone mutation,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 and this supposed process of natural selection would have to continue completely by chance, but without error, for millions of years.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To believe that is like believing that a lock and the key that opens it each came to be independently, but in a manner tot\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ally compatible with each other. Yet clearly, reason requires us to accept that two structures completely compatible with one another are both examples of simultaneous creation. To put it another way, reason requires us to accept that the orchid and the m
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 th were created in harmony with each other.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Another example of the flawless harmony among tropical life forms can be seen in those regions known as flood forests, found along the shores of the Amazon and its tributaries. When the rain is heaviest, they are
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  flooded, and during this period, a marvelous phenomenon takes place. Fish}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15021035\charrsid13336456 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 come to eat the fruits that fall into the water and distribute the seeds of those fruits of several species of tree.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Clearly, the variety of species in the rain forests are of great\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 importance to the native peoples living there. But what importance can they have for the billions of humans who do not live in such regions? Scientists have provided the answer: The plants and animals in these tropical forests are of vital importance to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
very human on Earth. They are described as "the Earth's lungs" because of the way they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and give off oxygen. Rain forests play a major role in the circulation of carbon and oxygen in the atmos
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 here, the global climate system, water circulation on Earth, and in many other natural balances. In addition, they represent a splendid source of new foods, products and medicines. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The magnificent variety of life in the rain forests is a major headache fo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
r Darwinism. The situation does not even permit evolutionists to offer any of their tall tales. Indeed, evolutionist researchers admit that they do not know the reason for the tropical rain forests' glorious biodiversity.54 Yet very evidently, God has cre
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ted the single-celled organisms, plant and animal species in these forests, just as He has created all living things. If evolutionists wish to find a way out of the dead end they find themselves in, they must accept this fact.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To grasp just how irrational \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 the evolutionist claim is, imagine a large factory that manufactures dozens of different products\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
a wide range of technological devices such as televisions and computers. Now, could these various products all have been invented by chance, with no consciou\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 intervention? Could these devices, products of advanced technology, gradually form through the effects of such natural phenomena as the sunlight, wind, and lightning?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Such an event is of course impossible; both a factory and the devices it manufactures re\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

Coral reefs come about gradually as dead corals, algae and crustaceans accumulate in different layers. They are found in tropical seas and can spread over rather large areas. In addition to their wealth of color and fo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Tens of thousands of widely differe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 , sea urchins, crabs, starfish, micro-organisms, invertebrates... 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 At 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) long, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest structure composed of living organisms. It plays host to 2,000 different species of fish, 350 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
pecies of coral, and 4,000 species of mollusks.55 But these are only the numbers of species identified to date. New species of animal and single-celled organisms are discovered every year.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 According to Marjorie Reaka-Kudla, Professor of Zoology at Maryland\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 University, the calculated number of described species on coral reefs is 93,000, and the estimated number should be about 600,000- 950,000 species.56
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In the same way as rain forests, coral reefs are full of living things created in such a way as to comple\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ment one another and meet each other's needs. For example, coral polyps live shared or symbiotic lives with single-celled algae (zooxanthellae) inside their tissues and green algae on their outer surfaces. Coral polyps take some of the nutrients produced 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y algae through photosynthesis. Algae, on the other hand, obtain the nutrients they need from the coral polyps. At the same time, the polyps provide a safe place for the algae to live.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Coral reefs are generally found in waters classified as being poor in t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
erms of nutrients.57 The question of how the reefs managed to grow in such waters has long been of great interest.58 According to the latest research, one reason for the wealth of species on the reefs is that these animals work together in harmony and co-
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
peration. One study published in the 18 October, 2001 edition of Nature magazine, revealed the importance of the species of sponges, mussels and ringworms living in the cavities in the reefs. By filtering vegetable plankton, these organisms, most of which
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 are very small, secrete substances such as ammonia and phosphate, needed by coral animals.59 In short, the system\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
consisting of thousands of small living species living in cavities in the reefs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 serves like an enormous filtering station.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 We obtain some real\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 benefits from the micro-organisms, plants and animals in the ecosystem: Corals secrete the calcium they absorb from the sea in the form of calcium carbonate. Working like a sophisticated chemical laboratory, they play an important role in regulating carb
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n dioxide balances, in both the ocean and the atmosphere. The fish, mussels and other living organisms in the coral reefs represent food sources for hundreds of millions of people. Since coral reefs generally form close to the surface, they protect shorel
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nes from the damaging effects of large waves, thus preventing erosion and reducing the harm done by storms. Thanks to coral reefs, the water between the shore and the reef is more tranquil in comparison to the open sea, constituting a habitat more suitabl
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  for fish and crustaceans.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
In addition, the wealth of genetic material from the wide variety of life on coral reefs is used in medical research and in the development of new drugs. Douglas Chadwick, a biologist and writer for National Geographic magazine, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 expresses some of these benefits we enjoy from the coral reefs: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Humanity's ties to the creatures living around coral reefs may multiply as medical research taps more of the organisms at home there. Some have already yielded compounds active against inflam\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
mations, asthma, heart disease, leukemia, tumors, bacterial and fungal infections, and viruses, including HIV. Studies found that chemicals used by sea slugs and certain sponges to repel fish also work on land as insecticides. Screening the venom of tropi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Each of the species living on coral reefs has been equipped with extraordinary systems and characteristics. For instance, some fish and other creatures have more color receptors than human beings, and therefore perceive colors better than we do
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
.61 Most coral reef fish are able to change their colors to a certain extent, and some species can do so as quickly as a chameleon.62 The large-eyed sea bass and squirrel fish are able to hunt at night, or at depths where no daylight penetrates, thanks to
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
their sensitive eyes. Puffer fish defend themselves by inflating their stomachs like a balloon and erecting their spines.63 Parrot fish camouflage themselves at night by covering themselves with a gelatinous sheath; they feed on algae by breaking off piec
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s of coral with their powerful, beak-like mouths.64 Scavenger fish and cleaner shrimp live off parasites on the fishes' skin. These, of course, are only a few of the perfect systems and flawless cooperations found among life forms on the reef.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Some reef-li\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ving fish species are able to camouflage themselves very well, thanks to their colors that closely match those of their surroundings. Species such as angel fish and butterfly fish possess very striking colors. Since they can easily be detected by predator
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, one would expect them to soon become extinct. But these fish survive despite their striking colors thanks to their own particular methods of defense. Evolutionists are unable to account for this state of affairs, which is the exact opposite of Darwinist
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 expectations. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
One evolutionist researcher studying this is the marine biologist Justin Marshall of Queensland University. In an article, "Why Are Reef Fish So Colorful?" in Scientific American magazine, Dr. Marshall describes this mystery "as tantalizing 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 as it is beautiful." 65
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
In fact, there is no mystery here at all, nor anything disappointing, only history being repeated. Darwin himself described as "trifling particulars of structure [that] often make me very uncomfortable. The sight of a feather in a p
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One biological phenomenon discovered at the beginning of the 21st century was that in the ocean floor's mud layer, certain bacteria and archaeobacteria con\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
sume methane, and thus perform an activity of vital importance to our lives. It is thought that these micro-organisms consume devour 300 million tons of methane every year, about as much as humans now inject into the atmosphere with agriculture, landfills
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and burning of fossil fuels.72 Therefore, as stated in Science magazine of July 20, 2001, "These methane-eating microbes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 once thought to be impossible\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 now look to be profoundly important to the planet's carbon cycle."73
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Another striking fact is the flawle\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 These creatures, too small to be seen with the naked eye, live thousands of meters down in the oceans in a layer of mud containing no oxygen, where they work non-stop. What would happen if\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 these single-celled organisms disappeared? Their importance is crystal clear: Should these micro-organisms vanish, then large quantities of methane gas ion in the sea bed would enter the atmosphere. Global warning of mud due to the greenhouse effect woul

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In 2001, it was learned that certain species of bacteria live beneath the ocean bed, in the Earth's crust.74 These organisms' \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
natural habitat lies up to 300 meters (985 feet) beneath the ocean floor, and thousands of meters under the surface. The activities they carry out are equally astonishing. These bacteria feed on rocks, and in doing so, perform another task of the greatest

balances on Earth, not just to human life. These contributions' importance and complexity are described with an example in an article titled "Ecosystem Services' Benefits Supplied to Human Societies by Natural Ecosystems" written by 11 recognized experts9
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 9\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  from various American universities: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Imagine, for example, human beings trying to colonize the moon. Assume for the sake of argument that the moon had already miraculously acquired some of the basic conditions for supporting human life, such as an atmosph
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ere, a climate, and a physical soil structure similar to those on Earth. The big question facing human colonists would then be, which of Earth's millions of species would need to be transported to the moon to make that sterile surface habitable? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One could\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 tackle that question systematically by first choosing from among all the species exploited directly for food, drink, spices, fiber, timber, pharmaceuticals, and industrial products such as waxes, rubber, and oils. Even if one were highly selective, the l
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
st could amount to hundreds or even thousands of species. And that would only be a start, since one would then need to consider which species are crucial to supporting those used directly: the bacteria, fungi, and invertebrates that help make soil fertile
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and break down wastes and organic matter; the insects, bats, and birds that pollinate flowers; and the grasses, herbs, and trees that hold soil in place, regulate the water cycle, and supply food for animals. The clear message of this exercise is that no 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ne knows which combinations of species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or even approximately how many\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are required to sustain human life.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Rather than selecting species directly, one might try another approach: Listing the ecosystem services needed by a lunar colony and then guessing at t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he types and numbers of species required to perform each. Yet determining which species are critical to the functioning of a particular ecosystem service is no simple task. Let us take soil fertility as an example. Soil organisms are crucial to the chemic
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
l conversion and physical transfer of essential nutrients to higher plants. But the abundance of soil organisms is absolutely staggering. Under a square yard of pasture in Denmark, for instance, the soil is inhabited by roughly 50,000 small earthworms and
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
their relatives, 50,000 insects and mites, and nearly 12 million roundworms. And that tally is only the beginning. The number of soil animals is tiny compared to the number of soil microorganisms: a pinch of fertile soil may contain over 30,000 protozoa, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 5\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
0,000 algae, 400,000 fungi, and billions of individual bacteria. Which must colonists bring to the moon to assure lush and continuing plant growth, soil renewal, waste disposal, and so on? Most of these soil-dwelling species have never been subjected to e
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
en cursory inspection: no human eye has ever blinked at them through a microscope, no human hand has ever typed out a name or description of them, and most human minds have never spent a moment reflecting on them. Yet the sobering fact is, as E. O. Wilson
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 put it: They don't need us, but we need them.100
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Clearly, the scientists who wrote this paper are pointing out that despite all the progress made in science, the vital role played by living things in ecological systems has been realized on recently. One th

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Yet only a small part of the biological variety existing today is actually used. According to the well-known environmentalist Norman Myers, for instance, human beings throughout the course of history have made use of 7,000 species of plants for nu

tritional purposes.102 On the other hand, it is estimated that the total number of edible plants is at least 75,000.103 Tropical regions in particular are full of thousands of plant species of a high nutritional value. Professor Peter Raven states that so
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e of the 250,000 species of flowering plants can be grown in regions where agriculture is still not possible, to provide useful products.104
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Most people cannot properly comprehend the importance of biodiversity. They imagine that all they require are a few\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 cereals such as wheat, rice and maize, a number of fruits and vegetables, and a few herds to provide meat and milk. Of course these few species are sufficient for a person's nutritional requirements. However, these also depend, directly or indirectly, on
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a wide range of bacteria, animals, insects and micro-organisms. Maurizio Paoletti of Pauda University says that: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Thousands of plants and animals and microorganisms are associated in rural ecosystems in the cycle of crop or animal production. Most of these\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  are still little known. 105 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Consider the food chain that links together millions of living species in a flawless cycle. Any ecosystem contains producers, such as green plants, consumers, such as animals, and breaking-down organisms such as bacteria and f

\emdash \loch\f0 about 30\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 metric tons for every person on Earth.107 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Humans, on the other hand, constitute the final link in the food chain. For example, the zander\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a freshwater bass and an excellent source of protein for humans\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
feeds on smaller fish that in turn, feed on invertebr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ate animals that eat algae. In short, a species we eat for nutritional purposes is closely linked to a great many other living species, from marine organisms too small to be seen with the naked eye to small invertebrates. This same state of affairs applie
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  to all living things that provide us with the vegetable and animal foodstuffs we consume every day.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Were it not for this diversity in \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Contrary to the distortions made by certain circles who seek to use biodiversity to further their own ideologies, it has absolutely noth\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ing to do with the fictitious theory of evolution. Proponents of evolution try to portray the variations and genetic diversity in nature as evidence, by misleading those who have little information on the subject of biology. However, genetic diversity wit
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
in a species consists of the exchange of biological information already possessed by members of that species to produce offspring with new genetic combinations. Therefore, no new genes nor any new species emerges as a result of genetic variation. Species 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
re always the same species, because their genes are always the same. Existing genes are merely brought together in different combinations, which has nothing at all to do with any supposed process of evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Genetic diversity is one of the most important\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  links in Earth's complex ecological chain. Paul Ehrlich, Professor of Biology at Stanford University, explains:

The total mass of all the organisms that have ever lived is many times greater than the total mass of the carbon and nitrogen atoms on Earth. Therefore, since the amount of ca\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rbon, nitrogen and other atoms on Earth is finite, and since no important additional quantity reaches it from space, how does life survive?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
The answer that there is a constant exchange and circulation of elements in the structures of living things. Nothing is wasted, therefore. The compounds in plant and animal corpses and dead organisms do not go to waste, but are reused repeatedly, thanks t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  the flawless recycling systems in nature. These cycles are to a large extent performed by living things we humans never see and have never even heard of.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One of these recycling processes involves the element of carbon. As we know, plants absorb carbon dio\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 xide\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 consisting of one carbon and two oxygen atoms, CO2\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 to perform photosynthesis. However, this is not sufficient to maintain the carbon balance, because a large amount of carbon remains gathered in dead plants and animals. At this point, bacteria and fu\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 gi enter the equation and release the carbon in dead bodies back into the soil and atmosphere. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The nitrogen cycle is also of great importance to the continuation of life. Plants need nitrogen to synthesize amino acids and proteins. Yet they cannot make di\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rect use of the gaseous nitrogen in the atmosphere, but absorb it in the form of nitrates from the soil. This conversion is the work of various micro-organisms. Nitrite bacteria convert nitrogen into a form that plants can use. Human beings and animals ob
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ain the nitrogen they need from plants, but single-celled organisms are of essential importance in converting nitrogen into forms that can be used by other living things. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 If there were insufficient nitrogen in the soil, then plants, and thus human beings \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and animals that depend on them, could not exist. And in nitrogen levels were any higher than they are, then the poisonous gas nitric oxide NO\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
which causes air pollution and acid rain and which damages the ozone layer and the ecology\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 would accumulate in t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e atmosphere. Drinking water would become polluted, and lakes, rivers and other freshwater ecosystems would be damaged.134
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Forests perform an important function in the circulation of water on Earth.135 Rain or melted snow absorbed by the soil returns to th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e atmosphere in the form of water vapor as the result of the transpiratoin of plants and trees. An enormous amount of water vaporizes through the leaves of trees: Plants work like living pumps that release water into the atmosphere by passing up through t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 eir stems and branches. In this way, water is constantly being recycled without disappearing into the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In addition, living things also play important roles in the global recycling of such elements as phosphorus, sulfur and others. One point requirin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
g emphasizing is that these cycles operate with perfect efficiency. Despite all the advanced technological means of the age we live in, only about 10% of our waste is ever recycled.136 Yet the recycling efforts carried out by living things for millions of
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 years is nearly 100%. No doubt, this is one of the countless marvels of creation in the system of interconnected living things.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As stated in an article titled "Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning: Maintainin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
g Natural Life Support Processes," written by 12 scientists137 from various universities, American and European experts have clearly shown that there is a direct correlation between species numbers and efficiency.138 To put it another way, species diversi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
y means high productivity. For example, seven years of research by Prof. David Tilman and his team determined that in any given environment, an area made up of several plant species gives more products than an equal area composed of only a few. A field so
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n with 16 species of plant produces 2.7 times greater biomass than a field sown with only one.139 According to Professor Tilman, the reason for this is that many species use the resources in the field more efficiently. Every species in the ecosystem can b
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 compared to a different sphere of work in a human society. In the same way that overall well-being increases as these various different jobs increase, so an ecosystem's productivity rises as its number of species increase.140
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 According to these research a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nd experiments, the reason why productivity increases is the co-operation between species.141 Yet Darwinism has no room for such joint endeavors as co-operation. According to Darwinism, nature is somewhere in which living things struggle to the death, and
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 in which the weak are eliminated. But observations have once again refuted the theory of evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Another fact, recent research reveals is that the diversity of species increases the resistance of an ecosystem. Biodiversity is literally an insurance mech\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
anism against the negative impact of drought, insect pests, disease and climate changes.142 Ecosystems with biodiversity are less vulnerable and less affected by adverse circumstances. In addition, biodiversity influences ecosystems,143 so that following

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Oxygen Production: Oxygen, one of the elements essential to life, is emitted by green plants and bacteria known as\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

s covered a period as long as 3.7 billion years and took place in stages. Therefore, according to the theory proposed by Darwin, the extraordinary variety of life is simply a product of natural processes and random effects.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 However, scientific findings com\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
pletely refute this claim. Many branches of science, such as paleontology, genetics and biochemistry, clearly show that not one single living species, let alone biodiversity, can be accounted for in terms of evolution..
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In dealing with the invalidity of Da\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rwinism's claims regarding speciation, let us first provide some general information about biological classification.
\par

Try writing down the names of all the animals, plants and micro-organisms you have ever encountered or heard of. No matter how long your list, it will represent only a very small fraction of the living species on Earth. Suppose that others from different 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ountries have also prepared such a list. A more comprehensive list may emerge when these are all combined together. But this time, the list will become confused because of some of the same life forms will be referred to by different names, or different on
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s by the same name.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To overcome these difficulties, biologists give every plant and animal a scientific name, such that all organisms are described according to a binomial classification system. The first word is generally Latin\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 a practice left over from t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 he days when Latin was an international language. For example, the dogs you see every day are Latin-named Canis familiaris, and cats are Felis catus.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Scientific nomenclature makes it possible to distinguish between species whose common names are often conf\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
used. For instance, the bird known as the robin in Europe is different from the bird known by that name in America. Confusion has been prevented by giving these separate species different names. The European robin is properly known as Erithacus rubecula, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nd its American counterpart as Turdus migratorius.162
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In addition to naming species both living and extinct, scientists also describe and classify them according to specific criteria. The science of naming, describing and classifying living things is known
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 as taxonomy or systematics. For example, animals are classified according to such criteria as their body structures and systems, internal organs, developmental stages, behavior and genetic information. Information about extinct species is obtained from f
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ssils. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The classification system in question consists of hierarchical categories, or seven main groups. In descending order of size, these are:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Kingdom
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Phylum (plural: phyla)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Class
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Order
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Family
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Genus (plural: genera)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Species
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Every living thing occupies it\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s own particular position in all of the above seven groups. (There are also sub-categories within this hierarchical classification.) For example, the tree we commonly refer to as the white pine is a member of the plant kingdom and of the phylum Tracheophy
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a. It is also a member of the class Pteropsida, the order Coniferales, the family Pinaceae, the genus Pinus and the species strobus. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The scientific name of the wolf, a carnivorous canine, is Canis lupus; it is also a member of the phylum of mammals, the o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rder Carnivora, the family Canidae and the genus Canis.163
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In this classification system, the largest unit is kingdom. Until the 20th century, most biologists divided the world of living things in two\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 either plants or animals. In the last century, however,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 progress in the fields of microbiology and biochemistry in particular revealed that this simple division didn't go far enough. Today, a five-kingdom classification is generally agreed upon. In addition to plants and animals, the fungi, protista and moner
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  are also regarded as separate kingdoms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The animal kingdom, containing more than 1 million described species, is the largest, made up of multi-celled organisms that digest food, generally move, and have complex systems and organs. The plant kingdom contai
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ns more than 260,000 species, which produce their own food by means of the exceedingly complex process of photosynthesis, and also meet the nutritional needs of other organisms. Fungi, which are not capable of photosynthesis and have no digestive systems 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 uch as those in animals, are a kingdom with some 100,000 members. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The Protista kingdom consists mainly of single-celled organisms with a cell nucleus, such as algae and diatoms. Some 100,000 members of this kingdom are known to exist. Monera, on the other\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 hand, consists of single-celled organisms that lack any nucleus, such as bacteria: Some 10,000 species of this kingdom have been described.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In biological classification, the kingdoms are followed by phyla, whose number varies according to different biolog\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ists. Still, the classification of 32 animal phyla and 10 plant phyla is generally accepted. In the animal kingdom, all species in a particular phylum possess a similar body structure, although phyla are very different from one another. For example, the p
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ylum that includes sponges is completely different from the phylum Chordata, which includes vertebrates\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
fish, mammals, birds and reptiles. The insects we are familiar with are of the phylum Arthropoda, the largest phylum in the animal kingdom, which also \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ncludes marine crustaceans.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Living things belonging to a particular class share many more common features than do members of a phylum. For example, birds, reptiles and mammals are all members of the phylum Chordata, but belong to different classes. Birds, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 which have wings and also feathers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a structure not to be found in any other animal group\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
are members of the class Aves. Reptiles, members of the class Reptilia, lay eggs, are cold-blooded and covered in scales. Mammals are members of the class Mammalia, a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d give birth to and suckle their young, are warm- blooded and generally covered in fur.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In biological classification, a class is divided into orders. The mammals with which we are familiar consist of 23 different classes. Those that feed on insects, like t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he mole and hedgehog, are members of the class Insectovira. Rodents such as mice and squirrels belong to the class Rodentia, and meat-eaters such as dogs and wolves belong to the class Carnivora.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The next rank is the family. Mammals, for instance, comprise\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 more than 100 families. Though cats and dogs both belong to the class Carnivora, cats are members of the family Felidae, and dogs of the family Canidae.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Genera consist of living groups that bear a close resemblance to one another, but which are not genera\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 lly able to crossbreed\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
dogs and foxes, for example, and different genera within the family Canidae. Dogs belong to the genus Canis, and foxes to the genus Vulpes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The species is the basic unit in biological classification. A species may be described as a c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ommunity of individuals that are able to reproduce among one another and share the same functional characteristics. Breeds or varieties within the same species typically have different scientific names. For example, the red fox is known as Vulpes vulpes, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he desert fox as Vulpes zerda, and the long-eared fox as Vulpes macrotis. If there are different groups or varieties within a living species, each of these groups constitutes a different sub-species.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Living things are described and classified by biologists\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 known as taxonomists. They divide into species those populations that mate only among themselves in nature, which give rise to viable offspring, and which resemble one another in terms of structural and functional properties. They determine the classific
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tion, such as the specific genus to which a species belongs, and which genera belong to which families. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Classifications by different taxonomists are basically similar, but still exhibit important differences. For example, five species may be grouped under\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 one, two or three different genera. That is why scientists often differ and disagree regarding the classification of different living things.164

The classifications outlined above are vital in terms of scientific research and study. Some, however, imagine that classification is a part of the theory of evolution. The reason for this is evolutionist propaganda. Modern taxonomists are largely evoluti
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nist biologists; and as a result, taxonomy and evolution are generally referred to in the same breath. Yet this is a grave error. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The foundations of taxonomy were laid before Darwin's theory of evolution was put forward. In addition, the founders of taxon\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 omy were scientists who believed in God and creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The British scientist and theologian John Ray (1627-1705) led the way in classifying living things, in the sense this is understood today.165 Ray grouped plants, birds, mammals, fish and insects accordi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ng to systematic criteria. Rather than classifying plants based on a single feature, he considered their structures in their entirety. He wrote several books on the subject, thus laying the foundations of the science of taxonomy. In his writings, he also 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
et out his observations of the magnificent order in nature.166 Ray, who is remembered for his enormous contributions to science, stated that the systems and characteristics in living things were all marvels of creation, and expressed his views in these te

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 There is for a free man no occupation more worthy and delightful than to contemplate the beauteous works of nature and honour the infinite wisdom and goodness of God.167
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The scientist regarded as the father of the modern biological classification syste\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
m is the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778),168 who first used the two-part scientific nomenclature system and developed a classification based on hierarchical categories. He gave a great many species their scientific names (such as Homo sapiens
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 for human beings).169 The year 1753, the year when the 10th edition of his book Systema Naturae was published, is regarded as the start of the science of taxonomy.170
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Linnaeus named and classified plant and animal specimens collected by himself and his stu\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
dents from all over the world, paying close attention to their structural similarities and differences. The system he developed is still in use, largely unaltered, today. So successful is his system in the description and classification of living things t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 at he has become one of the most eminent figures in the history of science.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Linnaeus believed that God created living things and that species do not change. He summed up his research in these words: "There are as many species as the Infinite Being produced\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 diverse forms in the beginning."171 According to him, classification revealed the Divine Order of God's creation.172 The interrelated hierarchy in living things was a sign of creation in God's flawless order and harmony, and not of evolution, as Darwin l
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ter believed. In his books, Linnaeus frequently stated that the magnificent plan he observed in the natural world could have come into being only through God's creation.

al groups means something entirely different to evolutionists, who claim that biological classification is evidence for evolution. The Turkish biologist Ali Demirsoy, for example, makes this claim: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The characteristic of living things is that they are arra\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nged according to a specific hierarchy in such a way as to form species, genera, families, orders, classes and kingdoms. Hierarchical arrangement is one of the most evident proofs of evolution. Were plants and animals not related among themselves, this hi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rarchical order could not have come about, and many groups would have developed in forms dissimilar to one another.173 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Darwin and his followers attempted to use the work of such scientists as Ray and Linnaeus by distorting it. They portrayed similar struc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
tures among living things, and the classifications based on them, as evidence that living things were descended from a common ancestor. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In fact, however, a scientific explanation for similar structures among living things had been made before Darwinism ca\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
me to dominate the scientific world. Natural scientists such as Carl Linnaeus and John Ray regarded the matter of similar characteristics among living things as an example of common creation. In other words, organs were similar not because they had evolve
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  from a common ancestor, but because they had been created individually to serve a specific purpose. Modern scientific discoveries have confirmed this.174
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Clearly, the classification of living things cannot be used as evidence in favor of evolution. For ex\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ample, in his book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, Professor Michael Denton examined this claim in the light of the scientific data and concluded that the hierarchical structure was no proof of evolution.175
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The fact is that in clutching at classifications,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  evolutionists are making a serious mistake. Products of artificial design\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
such as automobiles, furniture and paintings can also be classified hierarchically amongst themselves. Yet this does not prove that they came into being spontaneously or by chance;\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
on the contrary, it demonstrates that they were designed and produced by conscious human beings, according to a specific blueprint. Living things on Earth can be classified too, but that's because they exist by being created by Omniscient and Almighty God
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and not through unconscious coincidences as maintained by evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Following this general outline of biological classification, let us now examine Darwinism's main difficultyin the light of modern scientific findings.

rwin's book The Origin of Species was published in 1859, he imagined that his theory could account for life's extraordinary diversity. He had observed that there were natural variations within a living species. Visiting animal fairs in England, for instan
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e, he noted that breeds of cattle were very different, and that farmers could produce new breeds by selective crossbreeding. With this as his starting point, he then pursued the following logic: "Since living things can exhibit variety within themselves, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hen all of life can have descended from a single common ancestor of the course of long periods of time." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The fact is, however, that his hypothesis did not actually account for the origin of species at all. As the science of genetics advanced, it realized \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
that variation within a species could never lead to a new species emerging. What Darwin imagined to be evolution was in fact variation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Variation is a genetic phenomenon that causes individuals or groups within a species to exhibit different characteristic\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s. For example, all the humans on Earth possess basically the same genetic information. But thanks to the variation potential that genetic information permits, some have dark skin, others}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663

ry high even within a single species: Not only is there variation amongst humans in the genera and species of the bacteria that invade or live within us, but the organisms themselves often are highly diverse.176 For example, in dogs, one of the living spe
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ies most familiar to us, there are a large number of variations: bulldogs, Italian poodles, German shepherds, Turkish Kangals, Dalmatians, Chows, Shih Tzus and many more such breeds. There are also many varieties in the fruit and vegetables we eat every d
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y, with different tastes, nutritional contents, shelf lives and other characteristics.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 But such variation represents no evidence for evolution. It represents only the emergence of different combinations of already existing genetic information, and does not\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 endow resulting offspring with any new genetic information. The crucial question for the theory of evolution is of how brand-new information that can create\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and define\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
a brand-new species could come into being.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Variation always takes place within the boun\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
daries of genetic information, which bounds are referred to as the gene pool. All the characteristics in a living species' gene pool may emerge at various times, in various forms, thanks to variation. As a result, for example, breeds of reptiles may emerg
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 with a longer tail or slightly shorter legs than others of their species, but the genetic information for a long tail or short legs already exists in the reptiles' gene pool. Yet variation cannot transform reptiles into birds by fitting them out with win
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s, adding feathers to them and altering their metabolisms. That's because such a transformation requires an increase in genetic information, but in variation, there is no question of such a thing occurring..
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Darwin was unaware of all this when he launched \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
his theory. At the time, it was believed that variations had no bounds. In 1844 he wrote: "That a limit to variation does exist in nature is assumed by most authors, though I am unable to discover a single fact on which this belief is grounded."177 In The
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Origin of Species he attempted to portray various examples of what were actually variation as the greatest evidence for his theory. In Darwin's view, for instance, crossbreeding different variations of cattle in order to produce cows with a greater milk o
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tput would eventually turn cattle into an entirely new species. The best expression of Darwin's idea of "unbounded change" is in these words from The Origin of Species: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.178
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The reason why Darwin was so confident in his examples lay in the primitive level of scientific understanding in his day\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
. As the result of similar experiments on living things, however, 20th century science revealed the principle known as genetic homeostasis179. This principle revealed that all attempts at crossbreeding were insufficient to change a living species and that
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
between species, there were insuperable genetic barriers. In other words, the livestock breeders who mated different variations of cattle could not have produced another new species, as Darwin claimed. This was absolutely impossible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Norman Macbeth, author of the book Darwin Retried, has this to say: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The heart of the problem is whether living things do indeed vary to an unlimited extent... The species look stable. We have all heard of disappointed breeders who carried their work to a \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
certain point only to see the animals or plants revert to where they had started. 180
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Luther Burbank, one of the most eminent authorities in the field of livestock raising, wrote that "there are limits to the development possible, and these limits follow a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  law."181 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The biologist Edward Deevey describes how variation always takes place within specific genetic bounds: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Remarkable things have been done by cross-breeding... but wheat is still wheat, and not, for instance, grapefruit. We can no more grow wings \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 on pigs than hens can make cylindrical eggs. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A more contemporary example is the average increase in male height that has occurred the past century. Through better health care (and perhaps also some sexual selection, as some women prefer taller men as mate
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s), males have reached a record adult height during the last century, but the increase is rapidly disappearing, indicating that we have reached our limit. 182
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, variations give rise to certain changes that always remain within the genetic limits of\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 a species, but never impart to that species any new genetic information. That is why no variation represents an example of evolution. No matter how much you crossbreed different breeds of dogs or horses, the results will still be dogs or horses. No new s

As you see, the science of genetics has revealed that the variations that Darwin imagined accounted for the origin of species in fact bear no such significance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Therefore, evolutionist biologists have been forced to distinguish between variation within species and the formation of new species, and to advance two separate concepts regarding them. They gave the name micro-evolution to variation within species, and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 efined the formation of entirely new species as macro-evolution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The concept of macro-evolution was first used in 1927 by the Russian biologist Juri'i Filipchenko.184 The idea that micro-evolution could be used as evidence for macro-evolution was proposed\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 by a student of Filipchenko's, Theodosius Dobzhansky, in the 1930s. In his book Genetics and The Origin of Species, one of the basic texts of Darwinism, Dobzhansky suggested that the mechanisms of micro- and macro-evolution were the one and the same.185 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
his view received wide acceptance from evolutionist circles and has survived down to the present day. Richard Goldschmidt, a Berkeley University geneticist during those years, expressed the erroneous nature of this view: "The facts of microevolution do no
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  suffice for an understanding of macroevolution."186 In fact, what Goldschmidt referred to as micro-evolution was nothing more than variations within species.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 These two concepts have long appeared in biology textbooks, where a deceptive style is often used\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
. The examples of variation that evolutionist biologists describe as micro-evolution actually have nothing whatsoever to do with the theory of evolution. That's because the theory of evolution maintains that living things can acquire new genetic informati
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n through the mechanisms of mutation and natural selection. But as we have already seen, variations can never give rise to any new genetic information and therefore, cannot lead to evolution. Referring to variations as micro-evolution reflects an ideologi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 al preference on the part of evolutionist biologists.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The variations that they deliberately refer to as micro-evolution are a simple biological phenomenon, examples of which we encounter frequently in daily life. (Think of all the varieties of cats, dogs, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
apples, tomatoes, plants and animals you have ever seen.) Macro-evolution, on the other hand, refers to major changes such as that of a dinosaur into a bird, or a bear into a whale. In other words, there is no difference between the claims of macro-evolut
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 on and fairy tales in which a frog transforms into a prince.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 By using the concept of macro-evolution, evolutionist biologists seek to give the impression that is variations can give rise to brand new living species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and even genera\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
over the course of time. \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Indeed, many people who lack a sound knowledge of the subject are taken in by the superficial idea that micro-evolution can become macro-evolution in the long term. One can see many examples of this thinking. Some amateur evolutionists suggest that since 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he average height of human beings has increased by 2 centimeters (0.78 of an inch) over just the last century, that means that all kinds of evolution can occur over millions of years. But the fact is, as we have already seen, all variations such as increa
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 es in stature take place within specific genetic bounds and have nothing to do with evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In fact, even contemporary evolutionist authorities accept that the variations described as micro-evolution cannot give rise to new living classes, or lead to ma\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
cro-evolution. In a 1996 paper published in the journal Developmental Biology, the evolutionist biologists Scott Gilbert, John Opitz and Rudolf Raff stated that: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The Modern Synthesis is a remarkable achievement. However, starting in the 1970s, many biolog\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ists began questioning its adequacy in explaining evolution. Genetics might be adequate for explaining microevolution, but micro-evolutionary changes in gene frequency were not seen as able to turn a reptile into a mammal or to convert a fish into an amph
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 bian. Microevolution looks at adaptations that concern only the survival of the fittest, not the arrival of the fittest. As Goodwin (1995) points out, "the origin of species\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 Darwin's problem\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 remains unsolved.187
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 That the variations known as micro-evolution\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 cannot account for the claim of macro-evolution, and cannot explain the origin of species, is also admitted by other evolutionist biologists. The well-known evolutionist paleontologist Roger Lewin set out his conclusion at a four-day symposium attended b
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  150 evolutionists at the Chicago Museum of Natural History in November 1980: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The central question of the Chicago conference was whether the mechanisms underlying microevolution can be extrapolated to explain the phenomena of macroevolution ...}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The evolutionist biologists Fagerstrom, Schuster and Szathmary stated the same thing in an article published in Science magazine in 1996: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Major transitions in evolution\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 such as the origin of life, the emergence of eukaryo\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tic cells, and the origin of the human capacity for language, to name but a few\hich\f0 
\emdash \loch\f0 could not be farther away from an equilibrium. Also, they cannot be described satisfactorily by established models of microevolution. 189
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, micro-evolution is a biologi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cal phenomenon, and macro-evolution is an unscientific dogma\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
two entirely distinct concepts. Nonetheless, many evolutionists still believe that these two concepts are one and the same thing, and that micro-evolutionary changes can turn into macro-evolutio\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ary ones over long periods of time.190
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Other scientists, however, are aware that such a claim}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15021035\charrsid13336456 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 totally conflicts with the picture revealed by scientific findings and the fossil record. Douglas Erwin, from the American Museum of Natural History emphasized th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
is in a paper that appeared in the journal Evolution and Development in 2000.191 According to the American biologists Douglas Erwin and James Valentine, to account for the origin of new physical characteristics with micro-evolutionary changes that are in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 act nothing more than variations within species is incompatible with the available evidence.192 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The fact is, macro-evolution has never been observed. There is no explanation compatible with reason, logic and science as to how this might take place. Profes\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
sor of Microbiology Carl Woese expresses his view on the subject: "[T]he term \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 macroevolution' serves more to hide our ignorance than symbolize our understanding."193
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Consider the subjects depicted by evolutionists as concrete and observed instances of Dar\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

First let's consider the concept of species to get a better understanding of the evolutionist deception. Descriptions have been produced by various experts from different biological fields. As put by Troy Wood and Loren Rieseberg of Indiana U

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Biologist John Endler explains the complication as follows:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Species are "tools that are fashioned for characterizing organic diversity" (Lewin,19\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n it is inappropriate. Confusion and controversy have often resulted because different people working with different groups of organisms mean different things by "species."195}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The question of by what bounds the species, the basic unit in the classification of plants and animals, should be separated from other species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in other words, "Species Definition"\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0  is one of the most difficult for biology\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  to answer. It appears impossible in the present state of our knowledge to give a definition of the species that applies to all plant and animal groups.196
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Mention the word species, and most people will think of life forms such as dogs, horses, spiders, do\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
lphins, wheat or apples. However, biologists define the concept of species in a rather different way. In modern-day biology, a living species in the most general sense consists of a population of individuals able to mate and reproduce with one another. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s definition divides life forms that we generally speak of as if they were one single species into a number of different ones. For example, some 34,000 species of spiders have been described.197

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To better understand the evolution deception regarding specia\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
tion, we first need to define geographic isolation. Within any living species, there will be differences stemming from genetic variation. If geographical obstacles such as a mountain chain or river arise between individuals of a species, and if they becom
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  isolated from one another, then in all likelihood, within these two separated groups, different variations will begin to dominate.198 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Assume that in one group (variation A), darker skin and longer fur begin to predominate; and that another group (variati\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
on B) has shorter fur and lighter color. The longer the two populations remain separated from one another, the sharper variations A and B will become.199 Variations like these, with clear morphological differences despite their belonging to the same speci
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s, are known as subspecies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
At this point, the speciation claim enters the picture. Sometimes, after variations A and B have split away from one another due to geographic isolation and are brought back together again, their members are unable to interbreed
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  with one another. Since they cannot mate, they cease being subspecies, according to the biological definition, and become separate species. This is known as speciation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionists take this concept and extrapolate it "Look! There is speciation in natur\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e. In other words, new species emerge through natural mechanisms. So all species must have come into being in this same way." In fact, however, a serious deception is being perpetrated here, because important points are being overlooked or ignored:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 1)\tab Vari\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ations A and B, after being isolated from one another, may be unable to mate when reunited again. Yet this phenomenon generally stems from mating behavior. In other words, individuals belonging to variations A and B}{
\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15021035\charrsid13336456 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 regard each other as foreigners by the o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

even thouigh there is no genetic incompatibility to prevent it. In terms of genetic information, they all remain members of the same species. (For this very reason, the\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
concept of species remains a subject of debate in biology.)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 2)\tab The really important factor is that this speciation means a loss of genetic information, rather than an increase. The two variations have separated, but the reason for their division is not tha
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
t either one has acquired any new genetic data. Neither variation has acquired any proteins or new enzymes, much less a new organ. There is no development here. On the contrary, instead of a previous population that contains different, possibly recessive,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
pieces of genetic information (using our example, a population with both long and short fur, and dark and light coloration), there are now two populations that is each relatively impoverished in terms of genetic data.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Therefore, nothing about speciation pr\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ovides any support for the theory of evolution. Because it claims that all living species developed by chance, from the simple to the more complex, therefore, in order for the theory of evolution to be taken seriously, it needs to demonstrate mechanisms t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 at can increase genetic information. The bifurcation of an existing species because of a loss of genetic variation, obviously, a different phenomenon entirely. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionists actually admit this lack of relevance. For that reason, evolutionists describe ex\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
amples of variations within a species, and speciation by division into two populations (as you saw in the previous section) as micro-evolution\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
in the sense of variation within a species that already exists. However, the use of the word "evolution" in the \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
erm is deliberately misleading, because no evolutionary process is happening at all. The situation consists of only various combinations and distributions of genetic information already existing in that species' gene pool.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Then how did living types first e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 merge? How did the five kingdoms\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 monera, protista, fungus, plant and animal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  appear? These are the questions that evolutionists need to address. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As already stated, evolutionists refer to these subjects as macro-evolution, which is actually what they mean by the theory of evolution, because the genetic variations that Darwinists i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nsist on calling "micro-evolution" are biological phenomena that everyone can observe and agree on. And no matter how much evolutionists employ the term evolution in describing such phenomena, they actually have nothing to do with evolution at all. On the
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 other hand, the macro-evolution claim, has no supporting evidence, either in biological observations or in the fossil record.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 People lacking sufficient information on the subject may well fall into the error of thinking that "Since micro-evolution takes pl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ace in a very short space of time, macro-evolution could take place over tens of millions of years." Some evolutionists fall into the exact same error or seek to make use of it to convince others of the truth of their theory. All the so-called proofs of e
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
olution proposed by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species are of that kind, as are the examples put forward by later evolutionists. In their examples, they seek to use as evidence for their theory the genetic variety that they describe as micro-evolutio

 by the fossil record). Different variations and subspecies may appear within them, thanks to the richness of their gene pools. For example, there are rabbits that exhibit variations such as white fur, grey fur, longer or shorter ears, and these variation
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 become more pronounced in a given environment, depending on which natural conditions support them most appropriately. But species never turn into other species. There is no natural mechanism that can effect this, that can design new types and develop the
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
new organs, systems and body plans they require. Every species has been created with its own unique structures. And since God has created every one of them with a potential for variety, a wide but finite variation often emerges within each type. }{

Apart from amateurs with only a superficial knowledge of the subject, just about all evolutionists are well aware of the real difficulty they face in trying to account for the diversity of species on Earth. In his book\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 Genetics and the Origin of Species, Theodosius Dobzhansky, one of the architects of neo-Darwinism, stated that the real problem facing evolutionists was the variety of life.200
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This is the real issue on which Darwin and his followers must shed light. In T\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he Origin of Species, Darwin offered no concrete evidence, but merely speculated. In one letter, cited by his son Francis Darwin in his book Charles Darwin's Life and Letters, he admitted this: "When we descend to details, we can prove that no one species
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 has changed."201 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Darwin hoped that the answers to these questions would later be found and the formation of species proven over the course of time and with further scientific research. On the contrary, scientific discoveries have refuted Darwin every time
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 . Despite all the efforts made by evolutionists over the intervening 150 years, speciation through evolutionary mechanisms has remained devoid of any proof to support it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
as shown by honest confessions on the subject by various evolutionists.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Although speci\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ation is the backbone of the theory of evolution, it is also a concept strikingly shrouded in darkness. (More accurately, evolutionists possess no other evidence than the examples of micro-evolution and variation they have distorted.) For example, in a pa

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Cornell University's Professor Richard Harrison sets out the latest position in an article published in Nature magazine in 2001: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Natural communities\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  harbor an enormous variety of species ... But what of the origin of diversity? Much less has been written about how new species arise\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
although the process of speciation is central to evolutionary biology.204
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 It is not at all surprising, actually, that so \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
very little has been written, because scientific discoveries have revealed that one species cannot turn into another and that change takes place only within species, and within specific bounds. Not a single example of speciation through evolutionary mecha
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
isms has been observed. In an article published in the 18 January, 2001, edition of Nature, the evolutionist biologists Darren Irwin, Staffan Bensch and Trevor Price admit as much: "The evolutionary divergence of a single species into two has never been d
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rectly observed in nature."205

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Faced with these facts, some evolutionists propose an alibi along the lines of "We cannot observe spe\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nds as a place where the foundations of the theory of evolution were laid, and as "Darwin's laboratory." As a result of the 20th century's intense Darwinist propaganda, the Galapagos have acquired great fame .
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 These small islands lie fairly close to one an\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
other, some 1,000 kilometers off the coast of Ecuador, to the west of the South America. They are all volcanic in origin, having emerged from magma thrown up by a volcano several million years ago.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 During his five-year voyage on the explorer vessel H.M.S B\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
eagle, Darwin landed on the Galapagos in 1835, and spent several weeks there conducting observations. The diversity of plant cover and animal life on these islands, so distant from the mainland, made a great impression on Darwin.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The Galapagos Islands are \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a region containing a very large number of different plant and animal species\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
various tropical plants as well as finches, flamingos, penguins, giant tortoises, iguanas, seals, butterflies, and insects. Forty-two percent of the plants found on the Galapago\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, 75% of the bird species, 91% of the reptiles and all of the mammals are unique to the islands, not found anywhere else in the wild.214
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The unique Galapagos finches made these islands a landmark of Darwinism. There are 13 species of finches on the Galapag\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
os Islands, and another one on Cocos Island, some 600 kilometers to the northeast. The scientific literature refers to these 14 species as Galapagos finches or Darwin's finches. The birds finches vary between 7 and 15 centimeters in length, and generally 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ave dark-colored feathers. Being rather tame, they do not fly for very long distances. Although 14 different species have been classified, they bear a close resemblance to one another, exhibiting similar body shapes, colors and habits. Ornithologists dist
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 nguish between them mainly on the basis of beak shape and body size.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 These birds' profound influence had on Darwin is described in various accounts: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The finches, then, did play a role in the formulation of Darwin's theory and they became an important part\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  of his evidence for the role of natural selection in evolution.215
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In fact, Charles Darwin looked to 13 different species of finches from the Galapagos Islands to help bolster his theories of evolution. 216
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionists ever since Darwin have claimed tha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
t the present-day Galapagos finches evolved from a single species that arrived long ago from South America. At every opportunity, they use these birds as an example of evolution through natural selection, and portray them as one of the best-known proofs o
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  evolution. Morever, evolutionists claim that studies on the finches provide an overwhelming evidence for the role of evolutionary process in generating the extensive biodiversity.217
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionists refer to how different forms emerge as the result of a sin\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
gle species settling in various environments as adaptive radiation. They portray the so-called evolution of finches living on the Galapagos as a classic example of this; and may go even further and claim that the same process can be observed today.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Profess\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 or Ali Demirsoy, who devotes considerable space to the theory of evolution in his books, describes the Galapagos finches as a good example of adaptive radiation: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Adaptive radiation can be seen on a small scale in the finches living in the Galapagos Island\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s . . . Some of these birds are ground-feeders, eating cereals and seeds, others live in the trees, feeding on insects, while others still live in certain cacti, feeding on their seeds. But these birds, which all share the same origin, display a striking 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 evel of adaptive radiation in terms of their beak size and shape.218
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 According to Hau and Wikelski, Darwin's finches are "are a textbook example of adaptive radiation" and "one of the most convincing evidences for \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 evolution in action'.219

In terms of anatomy, behavior and ecology, the Galapagos finches are divided into 14 species. Because six of these feed on seeds on the ground, they are known as ground finches. These in turn are divided into three types, accor\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ding to their body and beak size: the great ground finch (Geospiza magnirostris), the medium ground finch (G. fortis) and the small ground finch (G. fuliginosa). The other ground finch types include the great cactus-eating ground finch (G. conirostris), w
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ich has a longer beak and eats cactus flowers and fruit pulp in addition to seeds, the small cactus ground finch (G. scandens), and the sharp-beaked ground finch (G. difficilis), which eats the eggs of other animals and feeds on blood, as well as seeds.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Si\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
x of the Galapagos species are tree finches. Apart from the vegetarian finch (Platyspiza crassirostris), these all feed on insects. The woodpecker finch (Cactospiza pallida) holds a cactus thorn in its beak to extract insects from their hiding places. The
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
mangrove finch (C. heliobates) uses its thick, flat beak to catch insects in the swamps. The other three tree-dwellers are the greater tree finch (Camarhyncus psittacula), the medium tree finch (C. pauper) and the small tree finch (C. parvulus). The veget
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 rian finch eats leaves, seeds, fruits and flowers with its short, slightly curved beak.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The warbler finch (Certhidea olivacea) has a small, thin beak and hunts insects. The Cocos Island finch (Pinaroloxias inornata) is the only species living outside the G\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
alapagos Islands, and feeds mainly on insects in trees and on the ground.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Every species of finch is equipped with a beak structure responding to its food requirements. The beaks of the Galapagos finches may be compared to pincers and files, each specially \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

In fact, it's rather surprising that finches living on the Galapagos Islands should have been given Darwin's name, because he was not the first one to discover them. Actually, t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hey had been known for a long time before. Captain James Colnett, for example, had referred to them back in 1798.220 Furthermore, contrary to what most people imagine, while Darwin was on the Galapagos Islands, his observation of the finches was rather su
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 erficial. His travel notes contain only one reference to the finches, and that he never mentions them at all in The Origins of Species.221
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In fact, Darwin attached importance to the finches only long after his voyage. While he was actually on the Islands, \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he did not find them worthy of much interest, collecting specimens of only nine of the 13 species. And he described only six of these as finches, describing the others as other species of bird. In short, he was unable to fully distinguish the finch specie
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, and also failed to establish a connection between beak shape and feeding habits. He did not even note which bird species was particular to which island. As stated by Michaela Hau and Martin Wikelski of University of Illinois "Due to this oversight durin
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  his visit of the Galapagos archipelago, Darwin did not recognize the potential importance of the finches for the theory he developed later.222

37, and concluded that these birds were unique to the Galapagos and that most of Darwin's records were wrong. Examination of the finches caught by the Beagle's crew and the regular records they kept brought Darwin's errors to light.223
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Frank Sulloway, a h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, following long years of traveling, Darwin concluded that the finches could represent an example of evolution\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but in so doing, he based himself of deficient and mistaken data. Actually,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 it was in fact not Darwin who mythologized the Galapagos finches, but 20th century evolutionists. The term Darwin's finches was first used by Percy Lowe in 1936, and the ornithologist David Lack spread the use of the term. Lack's 1947 book Darwin's Finch
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s was a standard-bearer for evolutionary propaganda in this area.226 With his support for neo-Darwinism's claims, he made the tale of Darwin's finches known to everyone; their so-called evolution has since been studied more than the other bird families.22

As early as the late 19th century, a flood of visitors began arriving at the Galapagos Islands. The visitors and researchers, most of them American, collected thousands of bird specimens. For example, the California Academy of Scien
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ces alone added more than 8,000 birds (including Darwin's finches), to its collection in 1905-1906.228 Galapagos finches soon found their way into many museum collections\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
not without an objective, of course. The aim was to complete the work that Darwin ha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  left half-finished and to rescue evolution from its predicament by finding valid evidence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 There was another important reason for the last century's evolutionary research into the Galapagos finches. In The Origin of Species, Darwin had written that a new \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
species' emergence by way of natural selection was a very slow process, for which reason it could not be observed, but only deduced. This was not acceptable by the standards of developing science. Neo-Darwinists embarked on a search for new evidence on wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ch to maintain their claims that evolution was scientific. At this point, the story of the Galapagos finches came to be regarded as saviors. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 These birds became the focus of wide-ranging studies. Many evolutionists issued statements based on their observat\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ions. In an article in the April 1953 Scientific American, David Lack claimed that the evolution of the birds on the Galapagos Islands had taken place recently, for which reason the islands were an exceptional place.229 Another evolutionist, Peter Grant, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ven maintained that the Galapagos finches were still evolving.230
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One can see the names of Peter and Rosemary Grant in most articles and papers about these finches. These two researchers first went to the Galapagos Islands in 1973 with the aim of seeing th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e effect of evolution on the finches, and have carried out detailed observations and studies ever since. They are thus considered experts on Darwin's finches.231

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
they caught with the help of nets, and after attaching a special band to each one they set them free again. By 1977 they had marked the majority of the birds on the island, and almost all of them by 1980.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In this way they regularly monitored some 20,000 fi\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nches from generation to generation. The absence of human beings and predators on this island made the finches so tame as to be effectively domesticated. This made their work very much easier. In addition, Professor Grant and his wife regularly measured t
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e amount of rain falling on the island.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Most research regarding Galapagos finches was carried out in the birds' natural habitat. Peter and Rosemary Grant and their assistants observed the birds under various climatic conditions and sought to identify the e
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ffects that alleged evolution had on them. Note that all the researchers involved in these studies believed that all living things are the result of evolution and had set to confirm, through their observations, this belief to which they were so devoted.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 As\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 for the climatic conditions on the Galapagos, there is usually a hot and rainy season between January and May, with the other months being cooler and drier. In addition, there may be wide variations between the initial and total amounts of rainfall in th
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0  hot, rainy season. Moreover, the atmospheric phenomenon known as El Ni\'f1\loch\f0 
o takes place at irregular intervals every two and 11 years, and at different levels of intensity, also alters the climatic balances. At such times there is excessive rainfall; subseq\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ent years are then generally dry and arid.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The level of rainfall is of vital importance to the ground finches that feed on seeds. In years of plentiful rain, ground finches can easily obtain the seeds they need to grow and breed. In years of drought, howev
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 er, the plants on the islands may produce a limited and inadequate amount of seeds, as a result of which some finches starve.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Grant and his colleagues measured the rainfall on Daphne Major as normal in 1976, but counted only one-fifth of this amount a year\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 later, in 1977. During the 18 months of drought from the middle of 1976 to January 1978, there was a significant drop in the quantity of seeds on the island and a major reduction in the numbers of ground finches. The population fell to 15% of the year be
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ore. They assumed that most of the other birds had died, and that a few had migrated.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Grant and his team made another important observation, noting that the finches that survived the drought were rather larger than normal and had slightly wider beaks. The \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
average beak of the ground finches on the island in 1977 was approximately half a millimeter deep, 5% greater than the average in 1976. (Beak depth is the distance between the topmost and lowest points where the beak joins the head.) Starting from this po
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nt, the researchers claimed that natural selection had separated out those finches feeding on seeds alone, and that those birds with beaks large enough to open large, hard seeds had managed to survive.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In an article in the October 1991 Scientific American,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 Peter Grant announced that this research offered direct evidence of evolution. According to him, 20 cases of selection were sufficient to turn a middle ground finch into a great ground finch. Assuming that drought occurred once every 10 years, this chang
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  could take place in as little as 200 years. Adding in a margin of error, Grant maintained that this transition could also last as long as 2,000 years\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
but that bearing in mind the length of time the birds had existed on the island, even this figure was ve\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
y low. He suggested that natural selection would take longer to transform a middle ground finch into a cactus ground finch.232 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Grant reiterated these claims in subsequent articles, insistently maintaining that the finches had confirmed Darwinism and was p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
roof that natural selection, via environmental pressure, caused organisms to evolve.233
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionist circles regarded these statements as a lifesaver. They were portrayed as evidence of evolution through natural selection, a process that had hitherto alway\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s been refuted by experiment and observation. The Grants' researches were made the subject of Jonathan Weiner's Pulitzer prize-winning book The Beak of the Finch. In that 1994 book, Weiner described this change in the beak as "the best and the most detail
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d demonstration to date of the power of Darwin's process."234 Again according to Weiner, the finch beak was an icon of evolution.235 With his book's publication, Peter and Rosemary Grant became heroes of Darwinism.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Indeed, Professor Grant and his team put \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
in a lot of hard work and field research on the Galapagos, but failed to display the same care and attention in analyzing their results. They fell into a grave error because they set about evaluating their findings, not according to objective scientific l
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 gic, but in the light of their evolutionist preconceptions.

o affects the western regions of North and South America in particular, and at such times, high levels of rain fall on the Galap\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
agos, leading to increased plant growth and an abundance of seeds. Ground finches are therefore easily able to find the food they need, and their numbers accordingly increase after such rainy periods.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Grant and his colleagues witnessed a similar situation \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
in 1982-83. With the rains, seeds became plentiful, and the average beak size of ground finches returned to the pre-1977 drought levels. This greatly surprised the observers, who were expecting a continuing "evolution" in beak size. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The change in Galapago\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s finches' average beak size actually has a different explanation: In years of drought when seeds are scarce, birds with beak a slightly larger than normal can open the remaining hard, large seeds with their more powerful beaks. Weaker individuals in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
inch population, with smaller beaks, die off since they are unable to adapt to the prevailing conditions. And thus, the average beak size increases. In rainy periods, on the other hand, when there is an abundance of small, soft seeds, the process works in
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
the opposite direction: Ground finches with smaller beaks can better adapt to their environment, and their numbers increase. Thus the average beak size returns to normal. In fact, Peter Grant and his student Lisle Gibbs admitted as much in an article publ
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 shed in Nature magazine in 1987.236
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, facts clearly reveal no such thing as evolutionary change. Average beak size may fluctuate according to the rainfall, sometimes increasing or decreasing around a fixed level, but there is no question of a net c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 hange.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Aware of this, Peter Grant said that, "the population, subjected to natural selection, is oscillating back and forth."237 Some evolutionist researchers say that natural selection works in two mutually opposed directions.238

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No matter how much a cloc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 k pendulum may swing back and forth, it never records any net progress. That will still apply if you operate a pendulum perfectly for millions of years.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Danny Faulkner, a professor of Astronomy and Physics at South Carolina University, states that the finc\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
h beaks' fluctuations cannot represent evidence of evolution: "And so if you have supposed microevolution one direction and then later it reverts right back to where it started from, that's not evolution, it can't be."239
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The average size of the Galapagos \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
finches' beaks increases or decreases according to food resources, but the way that evolutionist researchers imagine they have found evidence for evolution in fluctuations in the finches' beak is completely ideologically based.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 An objective scientist's task is to report that fact without speculation or distortion. It is unacceptable to exaggerate a phenomenon or to distort its true significance for the sake of producing evidence for an
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 y theory. Yet Professor Grant's analysis was completely opposed to his findings; he made a claim of a phenomenon that he never observed, that one finch species could turn into another in as short a time frame as 200}{

over his own research. In the words of the California University biologist Dr Jonathan Wells, this is "exaggerating the evidence."240
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Wells states that Darwinists frequently resort to such methods, and cites as an example some expressions in a pamphlet iss\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ued by the American National Academy of Sciences: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A 1999 booklet published by the National Academy describes Darwin's finches as "a particularly compelling example" of the origin of species. The booklet goes on to explain how the Grants and their colleagu
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
es showed "that a single year of drought on the islands can drive evolutionary changes in the finches," and that "if droughts occur about once every 10 years on the islands, a new species of finch might arise in only about 200 years."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 That's it. Rather tha\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
n confuse the reader by mentioning that selection was reversed after the drought, producing no long-term evolutionary change, the booklet simply omits this awkward fact. Like a stock promoter who claims a stock might double in value in twenty years becaus

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 It is astonishing that the respected and trustworthy American National Academy of S\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ciences should employ such a deception to look for evidence for natural selection and evolution in finches' beaks. Berkeley University's Professor Phillip Johnson said so in an article in the Wall Street Journal: "When our leading scientists have to resor

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In sum, the story of the Galapagos finches, claimed to represent one of the most impressive examples of evolution through natural selection, is a clear d\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 eception\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

 have often written that doing so requires considerable expertise.243 Therefore, the classification of these finches into 14 separate species is the subject of controversy among ornithologists.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To recapitulate, a species is defined as a population consisti\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ng of individuals with similar structural and functional characteristics, able to mate only with one another in nature, and which are unable to mate successfully with other individuals outside their own population. According to this definition, it is inco
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rect to divide Darwin's finches into 14 distinct species, because a significant proportion of them have been observed to interbreed. Indeed, Professor Grant admitted that six separate species could be recognized instead of 14, and in later studies he admi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ted that this figure could be lowered still further.244
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Genetic investigation of the Galapagos finches has shown that there is no genetic difference among them.245 For example, a joint study by researchers from the Max Planck Institute and Princeton Univer
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
sity in 1999 announced that the traditional classification of Galapagos finches was not apparent at the molecular level.246 Hau and Wikelski express the same: "There is no evidence for an absolute genetic barrier between Darwin's finch species, thus many 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 pecies can potentially hybridize.247 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In conclusion, the Galapagos finches are all subspecies of a single species. What Darwin saw on and imagined to be evolution was actually variation. Finches with the different appearances in question are in reality var
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 iations within a single species. There is no question of any new species emerging.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 There is a good reason for evolutionists' insistence on the finches; because finches are one of the groups exhibiting the greatest variation among bird families.248 As a res\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ult, they have been widely used in attempts to employ variation as evidence for evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 To see how the situation on the Galapagos Islands is a typical case of variation, we can look at another example: In 1967, 100 finches all belonging to the same spec\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ies were captured on the Island of Laysan in the Pacific Ocean and transported to Southeast Island, some 500 kilometers distant. Observations carried out 20 years later in the 1980s showed that the birds' beak structures were different from how they'd bee
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 initially.249 This study is just one example showing broad diversity in finches as a whole. Dr. Lee Spetner, the Israeli physicist and author of the book Not by Chance!, states that what can be observed here is not evolution, but the potential for variat

As described earlier, variation is no evidence of evolution, because it consists only of the emergence of various different combinations of existing genetic information and add\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s no new characteristics. The natural selection of variations belonging to a species is the phenomenon that evolutionist biologists refer to as micro-evolution. Since this cannot bring about a species change or produce new genetic information, it provides
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 no evidence for the theory of evolution.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Professor Ali Demirsoy, one of Turkey's leading proponents of the theory of evolution, maintains that this is a most striking example of natural selection.25\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
7 Professor Demirsoy, who has described these Industrial Revolution moths in many of his books, describes their case as follows: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The most interesting example on this subject is the evolutionary change that took place in a moth species (Biston betularia) l\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
iving in a region in England in which there was once dense factory smoke. These moths were white immediately before the Industrial Revolution (as far as we can tell from collections from the period) and lived on white lichens on the trunks of trees. This 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
revented them from being seen by predators. With the Industrial Revolution, these lichens darkened due to the soot emitted from factory chimneys, and light-colored moths became far more visible. Predators that fed on them, especially birds, were able to c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
tch them much more easily. However, the very small number of dark-colored individuals in the population prior to the Industrial Revolution acquired a great advantage due to this color change. Much of the population soon came to consist of dark-colored mot
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s." 258
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 First, let's consider the evolutionist claims regarding a classical instance of natural selection and perhaps the best-known story of evolutionary biology.259

reat Britain, was a major turning point in the history of mankind. With the building of factories and growth in industrial plants, the hitherto unknown problem of air pollution emerged. Heavy pollution afflicted such main industrial centers as Manchester,
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Liverpool and Birmingham. At the same time, color changes were recorded in various plants and animals around these cities. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A change in color was striking in the moth species Biston betularia, a member of the family Geometridae (engineer moths) of the clas\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Prior to the Industrial Revolution, this species generally consisted of light-grey individuals with darker spots. (For that reason,}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{
\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15021035\charrsid13336456 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 they are known as "peppered moths.") In the 1850s, dark-colored individuals were in t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he minority. According to some researchers, the first dark form was caught in 1811 and according to others, in 1848, in Manchester.260 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Light-colored members of this species are known as typic, and dark- colored individuals as melanic. In subsequent years,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 observations revealed that dark-colored individuals now constituted the majority of the population\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
so much so that by the 1950s, 90% of the moths in the region were melanic, or dark. (This situation was revered when air pollution was reduced as a result \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
f legislation mandating stricter emission controls. Light-colored moths again began to represent the majority, as they had before the Industrial Revolution.)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The phenomenon of a population composed of light-colored individuals gradually assuming a dark col\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
or is known as industrial melanism. Some 100 examples of this, mainly of nocturnal moths, have been reported in the scientific literature.261 The protein melanin leads moths to assume a darker shade: Therefore, a darker moth produces more melanin than a l
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ghter- colored one.262
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
But clearly, the 19th century statistics regarding melanism in moths are deficient and flawed, when compared to modern scientific standards. One of the two scientists who spent years researching this subject, Bruce Grant from William
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  and Mary University, express this fact: "During the last century and the early part of this one few people kept records about morph frequencies, so our picture of the rise and spread of melanism is sketchy."263
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The British biologist James William Tutt fir\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
st examined this color change in his book British Moths.264 According to Tutt, typic butterflies on light-colored lichens in unpolluted forest areas were less visible; therefore, they were spared being hunted by birds. (Lichens are a symbiotic plant commu
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ity consisting of algae and fungi.) In the wake of the Industrial Revolution, lichens died out because of pollution caused by soot and acid rain and revealed darkened tree trunks. In this way, melanic forms came to appear better camouflaged. Tutt maintain
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d that moth-eating birds were able to hunt light-colored moths more easily as they were more visible, so that the number of melanic individuals increased. To put it another way, he attempted to account for the phenomenon in question through evolution caus
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 d by natural selection stemming from environmental conditions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in this case, birds.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 J.W. Tutt's claim may appear reasonable at first sight, but it received little acceptance at the time. There was no evidence that these moths\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 which flew by night and rested \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
on trees by day\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 were actually hunted by birds. This led to entomologists and ornithologists looking askance at his theory.265
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Then in the 1920s, the British biologist J. W. Heslop Harrison developed a different theory: that melanism in animals stemmed directly from chemical substances in the air. Harrison reported that melanism could be produced in several other moth species if 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
heir larvae were fed on leaves contaminated with metallic salts.266 Harrison's claim was evaluated as a challenge to Darwinism.267 However, with the birth of neo-Darwinism in the 1940s, it lost esteem and the idea gained ground that melanism in moths was 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 he result of natural selection..
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The British entomologist Bernard Kettlewell, of Oxford University, was a researcher whose name became equated with the Industrial-Revolution moths after his research on the subject in the 1950s. Kettlewell carried out a num
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ber of experiments and field studies that placed the subject firmly on the scientific agenda. As one might expect, he was an evolutionist, and set out with the aim of finding evidence to support the theory.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Professor Kettlewell performed his first experime\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
nt in an aviary. He observed that peppered moths he released into the aviary first alighted, and were then hunted by the birds. This way, he determined that the birds caught and ate moths when they were at rest.268
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In his second experiment, he marked dark \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and light colored moths and released them during the daytime in a forested area affected by air pollution. He determined that the moths settled on tree trunks and that birds could more easily catch the more visible moths. That night, he released a number 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
f moths he had captured in a trap; of 447 melanics released, he recaptured 123; while of 137 released typicals, he recaptured only 18. Statistically, he recaptured 27.5% of the melanics, but only 13% of the typicals. Kettlewell concluded that "birds act a
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  selective agents, as postulated by evolutionary theory."269
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 He also performed the same experiment in a forest unaffected by air pollution. He was accompanied by Niko Tinbergen, known for his work in the field of animal behavior, and together they filmed t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
he birds hunting moths in the trees. This time, the dark- colored melanic moths were more easily visible on trees covered in light lichens. He encountered the exact opposite results to those in the forest area with high pollution, recapturing 12.5% of the
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 typicals compared to 6.3% of the melanics.270 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Kettlewell thought these statistics were adequate to confirm the thesis, and announced the results of his research with enormous excitement. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Evolutionist circles lost no time in backing Kettlewell's research.\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 Scientific American magazine broadcasted the study in an article titled "Darwin's Missing Evidence."271 Such was the importance ascribed to the subject that it soon became one of the fundamental examples in evolutionist literature.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The Industrial-Revoluti\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
on moths are still touted as the No. 1 piece of evidence for Darwinism, despite the passage of the intervening half century. Several evolutionists after Kettlewell repeated the experiment (for example, Clarke and Sheppard in 1966,272; Bishop in 1972,273 L
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 es and Creed in 1975,274 Bishop and Cook in 1975,275 Steward in 1977,276 and Murray and his team in 1980277),
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 However, this whole tale is invalid. Together with the errors of the research results mentioned above, the Industrial Revolution moths gained noth\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ing at all for the theory of evolution.

Professor Kettlewell's studies were carried out in the regions of Birmingham and Dorset. In later years, various scientists performed similar studies in other ar\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
eas. Their results astonished researchers, because the expected data failed to materialize. For example, they expected all the light-colored moths to be eliminated around Manchester, an area exposed to very heavy air pollution. Yet that is not what they f
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 und.278 This indicated that there were other factors leading to melanism in moths, beyond Kettlewell's thesis. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Investigations in other regions also failed to match Kettlewell's statements. The Liverpool University biologist Jim Bishop realized that there \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
were more melanics than expected in unpolluted, rural areas of Wales, and concluded that as yet unknown factors were involved.279 Two researchers who had worked alongside Kettlewell, David Lees and Robert Creed, revealed a darker- moth level of 80% in rur
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 l parts of eastern England with very little air pollution. These two scientists stated that Kettlewell's studies were not all that reliable: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 We conclude therefore that either the predation experiments and tests of conspicuousness to humans are misleading,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 or some factors or factors in addition to selective predation are responsible for maintaining the high melanic frequencies.280
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The zoologist R. C. Steward, who had studied melanism in moths, determined that although melanic moths were well camouflaged in \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
South Wales, they constituted only 20% of the population.281 Steward collected data from 165 separate areas of Britain, concluding that north of 52 degrees latitude, sulfur dioxide (a chemical cause of air pollution), was directly linked to melanism; but 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
hat south of 52 degrees latitude, other factors apart from air pollution might be having an effect. He described Kettlewell's error by saying, "it may not be possible to generalize from the results for one area, to explain geographic variation over the re
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t of Britain."282 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
As more research was carried out, data opposing Kettlewell's theory accumulated. The idea that birds led to natural selection by hunting moths proved to be a false assumption. In the words of R. J. Berry, one of Kettlewell's colleagues, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 "It is clear that melanic peppered moth frequencies are determined by much more than differential visual predation by birds."283
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Finally, in 1988, Professor Bruce Grant and his colleagues announced the results of their own research aimed at establishing th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e true cause of melanism in moths, according to which, the declines in melanism "correlated primarily with reductions in atmospheric sulfur dioxide."284
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, research over the last 20 to 30 years has not confirmed Kettlewell's thesis at all. Moreover,\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  it has become increasingly apparent that there were many errors\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Research in the last quarter of the 20th century revealed that his prediction did not refl\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ect the truth at all. With their observations in 104 separate points in Britain, David Lees and his colleagues revealed that there was no correlation between melanism and tree lichens; which they commented as being surprising.285 This was confirmed by oth
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
r studies carried out by American biologists in the same period.286 Furthermore, Kettlewell had accepted that there was a drop in melanism in moths, before lichens returned with the elimination of air pollution in the 1970s.287 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Had Kettlewell's and evolut\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ionists' claims been true, lichens would resumed their place on trees as air pollution was eradicated, after which light-colored moths would again come to constitute the majority. First, in other words, it was essential for moths to have places to rest on
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
and hide in. However, it was definitively demonstrated that this was not the case. For example, Professor Bruce Grant and his colleagues showed that the ratio of light-colored moths exceeded 93% in a region with a very sparse lichen covering.288 They made
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 an important comment: "We suggest that the role of lichens has been inappropriately emphasized in chronicles about the evolution of melanism in peppered moths."289}{

and remain there, motionless, for the rest of the day.

and were observed throughout the day. At night they were recaptured, so that the research was carried out at times incompatible with the moths' lifestyle. Kettlewell was act\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ally aware of this, but maintained that this would not affect the results of his experiment.291 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In fact, however, Kettlewell's assumption was too great an error to be overlooked. Daylight caused the moths to become confused and lose their way, and thus to\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 land on trees that would make them easy prey for birds. And in fact, the species B. betularia actually does not spend its days resting on tree trunks at all. The idea that these insects do is an error going back some 20 years.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In the early 1980s, research\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 by Kauri Mikkola from Helsinki University into caged Biston betularia moths first revealed this. Mikkola, a zoologist, observed that the moths rarely landed on tree trunks and normally rested beneath thin, more or less horizontal branches.292 Nocturnal m

Rory Howlett and Michael Majerus from Cambridge University, stated that they had come up with similar results: "... it seems certain that most B. betularia rest where they are hidden ... [and] that exposed areas of tree trunks are not an important resting
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
site for any form of B. betularia."294 Dr. Majerus of the Cambridge University Genetics Department collected their findings in a book, Melanism: Evolution in Action. He noted that despite some 40 years of intense research on this subject, he had encounter
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d only two Biston betularia moths on tree trunks and stated that this represented the most serious problem facing Kettlewell's thesis.295 Professor Jerry Coyne of Chicago University, himself an evolutionist, admitted that this fact by itself was sufficien
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  to invalidate Kettlewell's experiments.296
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Other researchers, the British biologists Tony Liebert and Paul Brakefield, have confirmed this. In 1987 these two scientists proved that this species of moth generally spends its resting time underneath or on th
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e sides of narrow branches.297
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The fact we need to concentrate on is that Kettlewell resorted to artificial methods in order to prove evolution through natural selection. B. betularia moths sleep beneath horizontal branches, concealing themselves from bird
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s and other predators. The only reason for the experiments to ignore such an important fact is Darwinist dogma. Evolutionists feel justified in engaging in all kinds of distortions to find evidence for Darwinism. Yet on every occasion, science dashes thei

Whenever Industrial-Revolution moths are mentioned, images of them resting on tree trunks come to mind. Books about evolution contain photographs of dark and light-colored moths on different trunks. But since peppered\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 moths rest underneath horizontal branches, where do the photos of them on perpendicular trunks come from?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The photographs in question originated with various researchers who carried out experiments on the moths in the last half century, and were determine\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d to have been used taken using either one of two different fraudulent techniques. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 One was to stick dead moths to a tree trunk with pins or glue (the method preferred by many researchers after Kettlewell).298 Photographs of the affixed moths were later du\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ly used in books, with no explanation given, as if these insects were photographed alive, in their natural environment. Documentaries and television programs have also employed this same method in.299
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 A second and different technique exploits the fact that\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 B. betularia moths have only limited ability to move in the daytime. The insects in a rather somnolent state, have been placed on tree trunks by hand. Since they remained immobile, they were easy to photograph. As stated by the Massachusetts University b
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ologist Theodore Sargent, many photographs have been obtained in this way and used in textbooks.300

This practice cannot, of course, be regarded as in any way excusable. For the last 20 years, it has been known that these moths do not rest on tree trunks. In other words, the phtographs in question do not reflect the truth. Yet these fraudulent illustrat

We have so far examined certain errors and mistakes in Kettlewell's experiments, to which Darwinists have pinned so many of their hopes: According to intensive research in Britain and America, the distribution of melanic moths in clean and polluted region
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
s is very different from what's expected. Contrary to expectations, there is no correlation between lichens and melanism. B. betularia moths do not rest on tree trunks. Another element that invalidates the experiment is the ignoring the fact that these an
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 mals are nocturnal. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
These and other errors have been brought out by various researchers in scientific books and papers in recent years. Michael Majerus' book, Melanism: Evolution in Action, published in 1998, is one of these. Professor Jerry Coyne, of Chi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 cago University's Department of Ecology and Evolution, introduced the book in question in an article published in Nature magazine on 5 November, 1998, and stressed its importance: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 From time to time, evolutionists re-examine a classic experimental study an\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d find, to their horror, that it is flawed or downright wrong ... Until now, however, the prize horse in our stable of examples has been the evolution of "industrial melanism" in the peppered moth, Biston betularia, presented by most teachers and textbook
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 as the paradigm of natural selection and evolution occurring within a human lifetime. The re-examination of this tale is the centerpiece of Michael Majerus's book, Melanism: Evolution in Action. Depressingly, Majerus shows that this classic example is in
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 bad shape, and, while not yet ready for the glue factory, needs serious attention. 302
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In addition to those errors listed above, Professor Coyne has also indicated the existence of other serious ones. He described his feelings after learning the truth of t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 he matter: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Finally, the results of Kettlewell's behavioral experiments were not replicated in later studies: moths have no tendency to choose matching backgrounds. Majerus finds many other flaws in the work, but they are too numerous to list here. I unear
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
thed additional problems when, embarrassed at having taught the standard Biston story for years, I read Kettlewell's papers for the first time ... My own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of six, that it was my father and no
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve. 303
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This forthrightness and honesty in describing the true facts by evolutionist Professor Coyne, who still works mainly in the field of genetics, is most noteworthy.. No doubt that the duty of anyone who c
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 laims to be guided by scientific thinking is to share the shame and disappointment felt by Coyne, to evaluate hollow Darwinist theses objectively and honestly, and to forthwith rid himself of evolutionist dogma.

Besides committing a number of errors, Bernard Kettlewell also ignored one very important factor. It is not only the species B. betularia in which melanic forms have spread in the wake of environmental pollution. An increase in dark
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
-colored individuals had been observed in other insect species. Some 100 cases of melanism had been identified in various life forms.304 For example, dark- colored form had increased in the two-spotted ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, while light-colored indi
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 iduals declined in numbers. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The colors in the two-spotted ladybird, approximately 3.5to 5.5 millimeters (0.1378 to 0.1969 of an inch) in size, exhibit variation.305 But birds do not hunt these insects because they find their taste unattractive.s In other 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
words, there is no question of dark-colored individuals not being eaten by birds simply because they are better camouflaged. Since melanic ladybirds absorb solar energy and environmental heat better, they are better adapted to smoky environments. This phe
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
omenon is known as thermal melanism.306 Every living thing has been created with systems and forms to allow it to survive in the environment where it lives. For example, the two-spotted ladybird is seen to lighten in color in low temperatures and to darke
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  in high temperatures.307 In other words, ladybirds' colors can change and darken according to temperature, which rises in tttline with air pollution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The clear significance of this has been known for long time. Melanism in moths may come about under the impact of very different factors beyond those claimed by Kettlewell. Indeed, three biologists\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
Theodore Sargent, Craig Millarand David Lambert\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 set out t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ese likely factors in a paper published in 1998: These include probable difference in the moths' and/or in their larvae's tolerances towards toxic or harmful chemical substances, and their sensitivity to parasites. These three researchers evaluated the ca
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
e of the Industrial-Revolution moths, mythologized by evolutionists, in these terms: "There is little persuasive evidence, in the form of rigorous and replicated observations and experiments, to support this explanation at the present time."308
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Similar vie\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ws have been expressed by many other scientists. According to the Italian biologists Giuseppe Sermonti and Paola Catastini, "Kettlewell's experiments do not prove in any acceptable way, according to the current scientific standard, the process he maintain
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 to have experimentally demonstrated." They concluded that, "The evidence Darwin lacked, Kettlewell lacked as well." 309 In short, the evidence that Darwin couldn't supply is still lacked by contemporary evolutionists. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The views of the Japanese biologist \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Atuhiro Sibatani on this subject represent a}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{

definitive judgment for evolutionists: "... the story of industrial melanism must be shelved, at least for the time being, as a paradigm of neo-Darwinian evolution ..." 310 According to Sibatani, excessive devot\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ion to neo-Darwinist theory led to other factors being left completely out of the equation. In addition, it led to regarding weak evidence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 for melanism being dependent on natural selection\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
more favorably than it actually should have been. But this is not \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
urprising in the least, because Darwinists have always resorted to all kinds of methods to advance the theory of evolution's acceptance. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The story of the Industrial- Revolution moths is just another one of the countless hollow evolutionary proofs produced\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  for the sake of validating the theory. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Professor Jerry Coyne says that it should be removed from the scientific literature, and describes the lessons to be learned from it: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 First, for the time being we must discard Biston as a well-understood example of\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 natural selection in action, although it is clearly a case of evolution ... It is also worth pondering why there has been general and unquestioned acceptance of Kettlewell's work. Perhaps such powerful stories discourage close scrutiny. 311

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The linguist Steven Pinker, one of Darwinism's foremost spokesmen, expresses the importance that natural selection holds for evolutionists: "Because there are no\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 alternatives, we would almost have to accept natural selection as the explanation of life on this planet even if there were no evidence for it." 320

 story of melanism in the moths. As you have already seen, however, this is a tale of no scientific value at all. But in the absence of any evidence as to its veracity, evolutionists assume that evolution is true, as Pinker does, and seek to adapt everyth

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The American biologist Dr. Jonathan Wells stresses that th\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 is is a belief held to be true: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No scientist with any integrity would point to the peppered myth as "a core example of natural selection." Without evidence, the assertion that melanism in peppered moths was due to natural selection is a faith-statement, n

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In his book Icons of Evolution, Wells devotes particular attention to the tale in question and sets out his conclusion: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
In 1986, evolutionary biologist John Endler wrote a book entitled Natural Selection in the Wild, now acknowledged to be a classic in the field. At the time, Endler was unaware of the problems being unearthed in the peppered moth story, so he listed it as 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ne of the few cases in which the cause of natural selection was known. But he also declared that "the time has passed for \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 
quick and dirty' studies of natural selection." Although most researchers are "satisfied in demonstrating merely that natural select\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
on occurred," Endler wrote, "This is equivalent to demonstrating a chemical reaction, and then not investigating its causes and mechanisms. A strong demonstration of natural selection combined with a lack of knowledge of its reasons and mechanisms is no b
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 tter than alchemy."

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 R\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 evolution. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
Obviously, the change involved not the moths' color, but their numbers; and this cannot be postulated as proof of evolution. There have been light and dark B. betularia moths since observations began, some 200 years ago. Different-colored indiv
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
iduals interbreed with one another. The gene pool of this population has contained combinations belonging to different colors right from the outset. In other words, no genetic information developed as a result of the Industrial Revolution, and no new gene
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  emerged. The Biston betularia moth has remained the same species, and there is no question of it turning into any other. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Clearly, nothing in this phenomenon can be described as an instance of evolution. In any case, some adherents of Darwinism do accept \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
this truth. Harrison Matthews, the well known British biologist and evolutionist, says in his foreword to the 1971 edition of Darwin's The Origin of Species: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 The [peppered moth] experiments beautifully demonstrate natural selection\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or survival of the fitt\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 est\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
in action, but they do not show evolution in progress; for however the populations may alter in their content of light, intermediate or dark forms, all the moths remain, from beginning to end, Biston betularia.323
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 In short, the different colors of this\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 species are examples of genetic variation. Changing environmental conditions did not create new genetic information and new characteristics in the moths. Light-colored moths were indeed better adapted to clean environments and darker ones to environments
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 with heavier pollution, but this constitutes no scientific evidence of natural selection. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Therefore, even if the moths' melanism were proved to be linked to natural selection in some way, this would still change nothing. All natural selection can do is we\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ed out deformed or weak individuals within a population, or those unable to adapt to environmental conditions. Natural selection has no evolutionary power.324
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Rather than accounting for evolution in the manner Darwin imagined, the phenomena of variation an\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
d natural selection represent a magnificent example of a protective principle foreseen by God, Who has created every type of living thing with systems to permit its survival. The organism's genetic system has a function that regulates its features within 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 pecific bounds, according to changes going on around it. Were that not so, the slightest change in factors such as climate or food sources could mean the end for that species.

 species he saw on his travels with the Beagle, and expressed his feeling in these words: "Every one must have admired the extreme beauty of many butterflies and of some moths... No language suffices to describe the splendor of the males of some tropical 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
pecies."325 Confronted by these observations, Darwin adopted a highly distorted and mistaken approach and suggested that they had emerged as the result of evolution. Evolutionists who followed him in the 20th century went even further and sought to make u
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 e of them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
If evolutionists want to use moths as evidence for evolution, they have to explain how moths answer the question of the origin of species, which has gone unanswered since Darwin's day. They must account for the emergence by evolution of tens of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
thousands of different species of moths and butterflies. They also have to explain why 48-million-year-old fossil butterflies are identical to specimens alive today326 and have remained unchanged for millions of years. How does that square with evolution?
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
In addition, evolutionists must abandon myths and fairy tales to answer these questions: How did the stunning patterns, dazzling colors and perfect symmetry in butterfly wings emerge? How did they come by their attractive external appearance and defense s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 ystems that protect them against predators? How did butterflies' superior flight mechanisms and systems that are marvels of engineering come about? How did metamorphosis\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
an exceptionally complex mechanism\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 come into existence? How did the complex program t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
at regulates the transformations from the egg to the caterpillar, the caterpillar to the pupa, and the pupa to the butterfly arise in this insect's genetic code?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Apart from speculation, evolutionists have no answers to these questions. They cannot account \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
for such extraordinary structures and flawless systems in terms of such random factors as natural selection and mutation. Darwinists are well aware that they have no evidence that these supposed mechanisms produce new species. Deceptions such as the myth 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 f the Industrial-Revolution moths are only proofs of the hopeless position in which evolutionists find themselves. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 It is a certain fact that God created butterflies and moths together with their details and the adaptations that respond to their needs, as \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
He did with all other beings in the universe. These are all indications of His omniscience and peerless creative artistry. One verse of the Qur'an states that creation is peculiar to God alone:

\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
rdinary range of life. Species diversity makes human life on Earth possible and establishes a means whereby all human beings' needs are met. Put it another way, biodiversity is of an essential importance to all human beings. Also noteworthy is how the sys
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 em comprised of countless micro-organisms, plants and animals functions as a whole, in complete harmony and balance. These matters definitely call for deep reflection.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 This book has emphasized how the theory of evolution represents the exact opposite of re\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ason, logic and science. You can see with just one example how irrational it is to account for the origin of living things in terms of chance-based evolution. Imagine a palace filled with expensive furniture, furnishings, pictures, statues, ornaments and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
orks of art. A wide variety of rare woods, brightly-colored glass, expensive marble, gold, silver, bronze and precious stones such as diamonds, emeralds and rubies have been used in its construction and d\'e9\loch\f0 
cor. In addition to all this rich splendor, there \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 s also impressive order and harmony.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Is anyone going to declare that this splendid palace arose by chance over the course of time? Could anyone possibly claim that its minerals, raw materials and elements came about as the result of natural phenomena such 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 as wind and rain, sun and lightning?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 No rational person of any common sense would ever suggest such a thing.}{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15150663 \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  }{\fs22\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af11\insrsid15021035\charrsid13336456 
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Not even a single picture in the whole palace could possibly have come into existence spontaneously, by chance. Clear the building in question and \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
the works in it were made by human hands. Even if he did not meet the artists, designers, architects and interior decorators in person, nobody could doubt their existence . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Now imagine the huge diversity of life on Earth, so much richer than even the most\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
 splendid palace. Think of the claim made by evolutionists that all these living species can come into being as the result of natural processes, chance and coincidence. Such a claim is even more irrational than to say that the palace came into existence s
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
ontaneously. As you have seen throughout this book, scientific findings and evidence definitely show that the extraordinary variety of life cannot be accounted for in terms of any such hollow concept as evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 Life and biological diversity are the prod\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0

seen with the help of microscopes to giant trees, reveal the existence and oneness of God. In the same way that every picture points to its own artist, living species point towards God, their Creator. Every living thing we encounter throughout our lives c

larities among living things, because they are composed of the same molecules, use the same water and air, and consume foodstuffs made up of the same molecules. Their metabolisms, and thus their genetic structures, will of course resemble one another. But
 thisis no evidence that they are descended from a common ancestor; it is the result of their being created on the basis of the same blueprint. For detailed information, see Harun Yahya's The True Origin of Life, \'ddstanbul: Vural Yay\'fdnc\'fdl\'fd

\par 199 The same also applies to human beings. The different races on Earth have different characteristics due to their geographic isolation. 
Dark skin came to predominate in one race and since these people lived in the same region and reproduced among themselves, a black-skinned race came into being. The same applies to oriental races. The differences in question (skin color, eye color and sha
p
e, height, hair color, etc.) were present in the genetic information of the first human beings, but some of these characteristics gradually came to predominate in human populations in different regions of the world, and different races emerged accordingly
. Were it not for geographic isolation, if all the races on Earth had intermarried for centuries, then everyone would be a "cross-breed," there would be no blacks, whites or orientals. All human beings would be an "average" of these features.

Adnan Oktar, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
, faith-related and scientific issues. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in helping many to return their faith in God, and, in many others, to gain a deeper insight into their faith. Harun Yahya's books appeal to
\hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af11\loch\f0 
all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the reader's perspective by encouraging him or her to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of God and His unity, and
