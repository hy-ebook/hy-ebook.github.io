The reason why a special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, durin
g
 the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service b
e rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the li
ght of Qur'anic verses, and people are invited to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah's verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader's mind. The sincere, plain an
d
 fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are
 influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This book and all the other works by Harun Yahya can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the book
s will find discussion very useful in that they will be able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and circulation of these books, which are wri
tten solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the books of the author are extremely convincing, so, for those who want to communicate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.
\par It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. 
\par In them, one will not find, as in some
 other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, styles unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, or hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart.

The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he then studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul Universit
y. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claim
s and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's s
eal on the cover of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad, the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose 
t
o disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used 
as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par All author' s works center around one goal: to convey the Qur' an' s message to people, encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues (such as the existence of Allah, His unity and the Hereaft
er), and to expose the feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are availa
ble in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers worldwide. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these 
works have been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects an
y
 one who reads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any long
e
r sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All c
ontemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur'an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books which create confusion in peoples' minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effec
ts in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to hav
e such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers' conviction. 

\par One
 point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the majority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and b
y
 conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be pro
vided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par It is no exaggeration to say that the collection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of Allah, these books w
ill be a means through which people in the 21st century will attain the peace, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

Allah created the angels and jinn before He created the Prophet Adam. They were glorifying Allah with praise. Then, Allah created Adam (as), the first human being, and commanded the angels to prostrate themselves to him. 
\par With wholehearted obedience, the angels complied with Allah' s command and prostrated themselves to Adam. Yet, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
 (Diabolis), one of the jinn, rebelled against this command. That is because, he believed that he was superior to Adam (as). Out of this arrogance, he replied to the question posed to him by Allah: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis,}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
 who dared such a disobedience to Allah' s command, was denounced by Allah and was destined to the eternal torment of Hell. 
\par The reason why }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 revolted against Allah was due to his "arrogance," or 
to put it in other words, "vanity." What instilled these feelings of pride in }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
 was a vice he had allowed to grow within himself: "Ego"\'85 
\par The equivalent term of "ego" in Arabic (}{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 enaniyet}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 ) is a derivative of the word ene. It means attributing a separate
 existence to one' s self, seeing one' s existence apart from and independent of Allah, and orienting one' s deeds, attitudes and outlook by it.
\par Arrogance, on the other hand, is merely one of the manifestations of "Ego." Once a person builds an "ego-center
ed attitude," eventually he will begin to boast about the qualities and means Allah had granted to him as blessings, such that, these means become the presumed justification of his flawed mindset. As the Prophet Muhammad (saas) said in a famous hadith, }{
\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 "Arrogance means ridiculing and rejecting the Truth and despising people.' (Muslim)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
\par No matter the circumstances, such a person sees himself superior and greatly valuable. In the Qur' an, such a person is said to deify himself. 
\par Consequently, arrogance and, in connection with it, vanity, equals to associating partners to Allah and disbelief. In fact, this vice of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 ' is explained thus: }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 "... Iblis who was arrogant and was one of the disbelievers." }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 
\b\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid10824162 (Surah Sad: 74)}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332  
\par The arrogance of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 , which made itself evi
dent when he was commanded to prostrate to Adam (as), ultimately resulted in eternal torment for him. This account indicates how great a danger arrogance is to those who harbour this evil feeling in their heart. 
\par Arrogance is Satan' s most fundamental char
acter flaw. Consequently, "arrogance" and "vanity," which is its derivative, are the source of all evil and perversion. As it was the case with millions of people who have lived in the past, these flaws for which Satan was guilty have also seized control 
of the base natures of innumerable number of people living today, drag them into the same evil ways of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 . 
\par An arrogant person, that is, someone who attributes an independent power to himself, and thus shows an undue arrogance towards Allah, and turns hi
s back to His verses, is continually vulnerable to Satan' s wiles. The purpose of this book is to present all the aspects of arrogance and the character flaws of a person who is seized by this malady, and to summon all, upon whom Satan exerts his influenc
e, to avoid him and to cleanse themselves of this evil.

With these aims in mind, throughout the book, we will consider the psychological condition of vain people, in relation to the fault of "arrogance," which is their inherent flaw. 
\par We hope that this book serves as a strong warning to all of our readers to shun this evil vice of }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 ' . }{

s we said earlier, the reason underlying a person' s arrogance is his erroneous assumption that he has an existenc
e apart from and independent of Allah, and that he has acquired his qualities of his own doing. However, in order to recognise the irrational nature of this line of thinking, one does not have necessarily to adhere to a faith.
\par Simply giving a little though
t to this matter would make one grasp that he has not come into being by his own will, that he has no idea whatsoever about the time he will meet his death, and that his physical characteristics had not been given to him on his own doing. All these factor
s
 should lead him to comprehend that everything he possesses, including his body, is temporal, and will ultimately perish. All these indicators are clear evidence that man is weak, and that nothing-not even those things he thinks he is in possession of-in 
a
ctuality, belong to himself, or that he exercises control over them. We could multiply these examples still, through deeper thought. In light of all these facts, it becomes clear how irrational is arrogance. However, the majority of people are so unconcer
ned about their role in life that they cannot grasp-or are prone to forget-even these simple facts. For this reason, in our day, one can hardly encounter a person who is not guilty of arrogance on some level. 
\par However, it is entirely unthinkable for a perso
n to become arrogant if he is aware that Allah is the Almighty, that He created everything from nothing, that it is Allah Who has endowed humans with all their qualities and bestowed upon them their possessions, and Who can take them back whenever He will
s, that all beings are mortal, and that the only One Whose existence will persist forever is Allah alone. Only the ones who fail to grasp these facts and forget about their deficiencies, weaknesses and death, can dare to act as such. 
\par The reasons underlying
 arrogance are of various kinds; an issue which is unimportant for some may become a cause for arrogance in others. But, in general, the reasons leading to feelings of arrogance in people are basically the same. These reasons are generally linked to peopl
e' s physical or intellectual qualities. The most frequent causes are the following: 
\par \bullet  Power and Wealth 
\par \bullet  Beauty and Youth
\par \bullet  Status, Prestige and Esteem 
\par \bullet  Intelligence, Enlightenment and Education 
\par Of course, we can always add to these causes. Other caus
es, depending on the environment in which one lives, can also lead to arrogance. Yet, a person who seeks the reasons for why some people have become arrogant will eventually come across these qualities mentioned above. 
\par Further scrutiny of the qualities me
ntioned above will lead one to conclude that these are all temporary qualities, over which one does not have control. All these are temporal values, no matter how beautiful, wealthy or intelligent a person may be. A man' s life is limited to 50-80 years o
r
, at most to a 100 years... Neither the wealthiest man, nor the most beautiful woman, has the privilege of enjoying a longer life in this world. He or she will eventually meet death, although he had sought to avoid it and lose everything which he had been
 boasting about. 
\par This aside, we need to keep in mind that all such things as wealth, beauty, and health are not guaranteed for life. It is only a matter of a moment when one can lose all of his or her material and spiritual attributes of which he is so pro
ud. It is not infrequently that we can witness examples of people who experience such losses. The Qur' an reveals the true nature of the life of this world, that we take heed:

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 An investigation of history reveals that the possession of power and wealth is a common characteristic of arrogant and haughty people. Due to the power they held, these 
people rejected faith and subjected those around them to oppression. 
\par However, these people, who grew arrogant on account of their wealth and power, failed to grasp a very important truth: everyone, whether rich or poor, will one day surely meet death and 
be placed under the earth. In death, money and possessions no longer have any significance. The eternal life of the hereafter will be the only truth awaiting him. The money and wealth he accumulated in the life of this world will be of no benefit to him, 
u
nless he spent it for the cause of Allah. A person who boasts of his wealth, and holds an excessively high opinion of himself, in actuality, forgets the fact that he is vulnerable even to a miniscule virus invisible to the naked eye. Even a world of wealt
h proves insufficient to improve his safety against the danger of a tiny microbe. Moreover, all the riches of the world, even if it were doubled, cannot make him immune to death. 
\par Although he may assume that he will continue to be held in high esteem with t
he goods and money he leaves behind in this world, he will be greatly disappointed on the Day of Judgment. That is because, no matter how rich he may be, there will remain only a few people who will still remember him only 3 to 5 years after his death. Ev
e
n if he, exceptionally, were to live on in the memories of a greater number of people, it would not help him in the least. Indeed, while he is suffering from torment for his arrogance towards Allah, how people will remember him will lose all its importanc
e. 
\par Such people develop their character based on arrogance. However, the kind of character derived from the power of wealth is not "character" in its true sense of the word; losing his wealth, or meeting someone wealthier than he, causes his self-confidence
 and so-called character to disappear. That is, if the self-confidence and character of a person are dependent upon such factors, then that person is doomed to a lack of confidence and frustration when he loses them. 
\par However, a person who believes in Alla
h, the Creator of all beings, and puts his trust in Him, maintains his strong character, no matter what befalls him. That is because the only source of power is Allah, and Allah is the Eternal Owner of Sovereignty and the Everlasting. Therefore, the only 
factor upon which one' s self-confidence should depend is one' s faith and trust in Allah.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 A person who turns to Allah, and puts his trust in Him in all his affairs, gains a strong character because he knows that there is no power other than Him. Unless All
ah wills, nothing will happen to a person of faith. Meanwhile, when Allah decides on something, He just says to it, "Be!" and it is. For human beings, who are weak and in need of their Creator, there exists nothing greater than being Allah' s friend. Ther
efore, for a believer, it is unthinkable to assume an image of himself that is founded on material wealth, or any other temporal quality. He considers these qualities merely as Allah' s blessings, and puts them to use for the cause of Allah alone. }{

e also a form of property; they exploit them as a means for ostentation. They attribute the good qualities of their children to themselves, and thus feel pride, as if it is they who have given those qualities to their children. Rather than recognising the
i
r children as blessings Allah committed into their care to be brought up in the way that pleases Him, they consider their children as means to compete with others. For this reason, everything related to their children, their food, clothes, the schools the
y attend, their profession etc. become matters of prestige for them. 
\par "Ostentation," which should be regarded as a social "disease," is not restricted to this example alone. The majority of people boast about their social status, clothes, cars, houses, good
s and so on. Interestingly, their main ambition in this form of ostentation is to earn the respect of others. That is, their choices do not reflect what they really need to improve their health, comfort or tastes. They attach too much importance to the op
inions of others. This subjects them to an emotional roller-coaster ride, of greater and greater ambition and more desires. But, will this ambition suffice to quench the desires of man' s lower self? 
\par Allah informs us in the Qur' an that the greed of disbelievers is insatiable. The greedier a person becomes the more arrogant and rebellious he becomes. Indeed, the verse below offers an accurate description of the psychology of a disbeliever:

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 As the above verse also brings to light, because the desires of the lower self are insatiable, it is always in 
need of more. It passionately desires something, but once it is attained, it immediately seeks something else. A person believes that he will be happy once he attains his desire, but he soon finds that the attainment of what he thought would be a desirabl
e
 end does not bring him lasting happiness. Despite this fact, however, guided by his greed, he hoards wealth and continually strives for more. For instance, after years of effort, a person eventually manages to buy a flat. But, after just a few years, he 
l
oses interest in the house, and begins to set his sights on a better one. Let' s suppose that he also succeeds in purchasing it; after only five years, he starts to dream of yet a better house, with pool and garden this time, and this vicious circle goes 
on and on. 
\par We often come across similar examples in our own lives. The pursuit of a house, car, summer home, children, personal benefits, etc. lures these people into the downward spiral of the allurement of the life of this world, and occupies them until 
death comes upon them. Of course, there is nothing wrong with such pursuits; it is entirely legitimate. But, a life entirely guided by these ambitions has no meaning. As a matter of fact, some "players" attain many of their desires in this game, while tho
ugh the majority fail, and meet death before they can satisfy their greed. 
\par It is futile to be consumed with such greed, but the transience of this world, or the brevity of this life, are not the only reasons for its futility. We also need to consider the f
ollowing: even the wealthiest man, living in a stately mansion, or opulent house with more rooms than occupants, can only spend his time in one room at a time. Though he may have a very sophisticated wardrobe, the fact remains that he can only wear one su
it at a time. Even if he changes his suit every hour, he will soon become bored. If he is served countless varieties of gourmet foods, his appetite would be quenched before he eats at the most 2 servings. An attempt to have more may turn out to be harmful

It is apparent that most of human behaviour is shepherded by vain avarice. However, from the viewpoint of one with the ability to discern, these are not the things for which to be ambitious. On the contrary, they are the delusions of the life of this worl

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Beauty is also among the c
auses that may lead a person to become arrogant. People are all too easily deceived by the fleeting allurements of this world. However, physical beauty is not a quality of one' s own making. It is granted by Allah. It is also a quality that can be taken b
ack at any time.
\par Everyone knows that it is a matter of an instant in which one can lose his or her good-looks. A facial scar, or loss of an organ, can change the looks of a person forever, and none should regard himself as an exception. Even if none of thes
e terrible things were to happen, a person must keep in mind that he is also vulnerable to a merciless and irrepressible enemy; that is, aging. Even the most beautiful person in the world cannot resist the process of aging, and eventually her beauty, firs
t
 diminished by wrinkles and other traces of old age, fades in time. Celebrities are a good example of this reality. As an immutable law of Allah, these people, who one day bask in the adulation of fans, later cannot prevent themselves from growing older. 
A
ll the wealth and means at their disposal cannot save them from this inevitable end. These examples help to better understand how vain it is to be arrogant on account of one' s beauty and youth. Still, it will be helpful to consider what the body goes thr
ough during the initial phases that take place during the first 10 days after death. 
\par The corpse, when buried under ground, will go through a rapid process of decay. Soon after it is placed in the grave, bacteria will start to function. The gasses released 
from these organisms will inflate the body, starting from the abdomen, altering its shape and appearance. Bloody mucous will dribble out the mouth and nose due to the pressure of gasses on the diaphragm. Accompanying this exterior transformations of the b
ody, its internal organs will also decay, letting off an unbearably disgusting smell. The brain will decay. Bones will detach from sinews and the skeleton will fall apart. This process will continue until the whole body is reduced to a mere heap of bones.

\par T
his is exactly what will happen to us all, even though we find it difficult to think of. One who assumes that his physical attractiveness belongs to him must also think the same for this decayed corpse. Yet, this is what even the most beautiful person in 
the world will ardently avoid, because it is unthinkable to boast or become haughty towards Allah with a decayed body. 
\par Some, on the other hand, lack self-confidence because they are not noticeably attractive. In fact, this is another form of egotism. The p
erson in question, attributes her beauty to herself, and considers the absence of it as a deficiency or flaw. Regarding this issue, it is the conduct of believers that is most commendable. Believers feel contented with what Allah has granted them, and do 
not make their physical qualities a matter of self-doubt or arrogance. They are aware that the real owner of their bodies is Allah, and that they are merely being tested by them. It is the soul that matters and one' s nearness to Allah. 
\par Being grateful to A
llah, aware that beauty is a blessing granted by Him to man, and thereby, being modest, is the most exemplary manner of conduct. Meanwhile, it may well be that Allah grants inner beauty, charm and light from His sight to one who avoids boasting about what
 he has, remaining aware that it is Allah Who possesses everything. Thus, such a person may be better liked by people than a lot of others would with a better physical appearance.

de from wealth, beauty and social status, which are the major causes of arrogance, there is another factor to which people attach considerable importance. They consider being a graduate of a prestigious college, for instance, a very important matter of pr
ide. 
\par However, as is the case with all other things in life, attending such a school is also a part of the destiny Allah has predetermined. Therefore, making this a matter of pride would be an unjust glorification of one' s self. 
\par In the hereafter, man will
 be questioned, neither about the college he graduated from, nor of his intellectual background. (Certainly, an education is important but definitely not something to boast about.) In Allah' s presence, man will be held responsible for his sincerity, fait
h, modesty, and his acts of worship. 
\par However, for such people, who make it their major goal to attain the temporal values of this world, any quality-be it minor or important-may turn out to be a cause for arrogance. Possessing profound knowledge about a su
bject is one such quality. In fact, though a person may be exceedingly skilled at mathematics, or may have developed important theories in the field of physics, there is only one important issue we need to consider; even if he employs all his knowledge, h
e can never change even a single law of physics or create a living cell. 
\par Apart from the basic issues we have mentioned above, there are also those who boast of their insignificant qualities. For them, simple privileges, such as a good-looking hair, a new c
ar, clothes, competence with computers, a rich voice, popular friends, etc. may be reason for them to boast. However, those who are more wise are continually aware of the banality and triviality of this simplistic type of thinking. 
\par The wise, that is, the 
prophets and believers, who had remained modest throughout their lives, provide a good role model for us to follow. The Prophet Sulayman, for instance, employed all his wealth and power for the cause of Allah. Similarly, Dhu' l-Qarnayn considered the auth
ority he had over nations as a means to serve the religion of Allah. The Prophet Dawud, as well, showed meticulous attention in complying with Allah' s commands and in being just. 
\par In addition to these few chosen people, the lives of the followers of the Pr
ophet Muhammad (saas) also provide a good role model for Muslims. Although the majority of them came from the prominent families of the society they lived in, they did not hesitate for a moment but sided with Allah and His Messenger, when forced to make a
 
choice between their possessions, money, the people around them, and Allah' s religion. That is because, they were very well aware that the life of this world is insignificant, and that the real resting-place is the hereafter. With the intention of earnin
g
 the good pleasure of Allah, they sided with the Prophet (saas), emigrated when they were forced to, left behind their wealth and riches, did not covet the social standing or rank they had held, and devoted their entire lives to service in Allah' s path. 

\par The character that is pleasing to Allah is obvious. Those who may currently be in possession of blessings such as wealth, beauty, intelligence, prestige, youth etc., must remember to keep in mind that it is Allah Who grants them these and that they are be
ing tested by them. On the Day of Judgement, they will be called to give an account for each of these blessings. In the Qur' an, Allah relates the psychology of those who fail to grasp this fact, and thereby, become arrogant towards Him:

A normal person, who enjoys a stable state of mind, is extroverted, open and sincere. An arrogant person, however, suffers a darkened and disturbed state of mind. Being deceived and carried away by his pride, his inner-world is a sombr
e place of distress and anxiety; consumed with devious thoughts and schemes. Such a state of mind becomes exhausting, and causes them to age before their time. 
\par Lacking in character, they are cold and ill-tempered. It is rare to see a pleasant expression o
r sign of affection or appreciation on their face, or to hear an encouraging word from them. One cannot feel relaxed among them or enjoy their company. Men tend to become aggressive and irascible. In woman, on the other hand, arrogance manifests itself as
 uneasiness. Wherever they are, a minor problem is likely to cause tension in them and absorb them in quarrel.

i
cism or admonition is degradation. To adopt such a state of mind is detrimental both in the spiritual and physical sense. Their tone of voice fluctuates, they are impaired by twitching, and in their face, you will not find signs of sincerity. Ultimately, 
they never find peace and comfort. 
\par They maintain goals such as being "the most beautiful," "the most clever" or "the most qualified." Such pursuits place them under constant pressure. Seeing themselves as so perfect or superior, (or rather that they aim to
 prove themselves to be so), even a minor admonishment suffices to infuriate them. However, there is a point on which they are forgetful; they may seek to present themselves as perfect and infallible, and in some cases even succeed at doing so. Yet, on th

The arrogant love themselves most, and thus, can never experience true love. At most, they can only pretend to love. They fi
nd it demeaning to show their love to others; they always desire to be the one to whom love and attention is shown. They deem it to be a kind of weakness to love others and to show them affection. 
\par Due to their overbearing pride, they are incapable of love
. Loving another person demands, primarily, that one be able to discern those qualities that are deserving of love. Yet, an arrogant person is loath to recognise these favourable qualities in people. Indeed, in their eyes, it is they who are most worthy o
f love. For this reason, they feel jealous of the beauty, intelligence, virtue or possessions of others. Sometimes, this jealousy reaches to such an extent that they wish others to lose all their good. 
\par Another reason why they are incapable of showing love 
is that they cannot appreciate other people' s good qualities. Moreover, even if they were to recognise them, they expressly avoid mentioning them. The presence of someone else with better qualities than they makes them feel uneasy. Consumed with jealousy
, they are malicious and hostile. 
\par The arrogant, with such disquieted spirit, are, in actuality, in great loss; throughout their lives, they are never able to experience true love, a feeling which is a great blessing from Allah. Apart from not being able to
 love, they are also not loved in the true sense, though they may be good-looking or intelligent. Because they share certain mutual interests, they may have established relationships with some people. Otherwise, most dislike their company. There is someth
ing unpleasant about their character and air. Considering the absence of tenderness, warmth, sincerity and modesty in their character, it is not difficult to understand why people avoid such people, no matter what their status or privilege. \tab

An arrogant person is also unable to enjoy anything. Events and places that others generally take pleasure in do not meet up to their taste. In such circumstances, they seek the imperfections of others, and, all the while, strive to 
make known their supposed superiority. They consider being "cool" and "indifferent" as a mark of that superiority, and find it degrading to enjoy themselves. 
\par Nevertheless, it is again only themselves who suffer from the consequences of such a disposition;
 they cannot taste the blessings of having joy, constantly submerged in their gloomy world. Curiously, they are incapable of understanding the reason for their uneasiness. Although they possess many superior features, according to them, they cannot rid th
emselves of distress and unhappiness. This demonstrates the fact that those who are arrogant towards Allah are bereft of understanding; they cannot grasp that it is Allah Who inspires this anxiety into their hearts.

n. Over an extended period of time, this causes tension and stress on the human body. Concerns such as over making a mistake, being subject to criticism or humiliation, losing prestige, earning the approval of others, or losing things for which one is pro
ud, puts man under extreme pressure and demand constant attention of him. This is just the exact condition for stress to result. Hence, the facial expressions and the moods of an arrogant person vary greatly from that of a modest one. 
\par An arrogant person, w
ho leads his entire life under undue stress, actually causes great harm to his body. This, however, he often fails to understand. Lost in the pursuit of being seen as superior puts him under great pressure, the traces of which it is possible to discern in
 his physical body.
\par The distress the arrogant feel internally manifests itself physically. Their hair, for instance, becomes dull and slows its growth. Their skin thickens, becomes hard and loses its pliability. The tension in their muscles become apparent.
 They look old for their age, and wrinkles begin to appear. Their mouth dries. Their eyes lose their vitality and become dull. Under the influence of arrogance, masculine qualities appear in women; their skin thickens, they become hairy and veiny, and the
ir hands bony. Their skin turns to dark. Any positive physical aspects in such an arrogant person does not help to counter his or her ultimate lack of appeal. 
\par Despite any physical charm, a "deficiency," as a consequence of his pride and lack of wisdom, pervades an arrogant person' s body. Ironically, a modest and sincere believer has a positive effect on people, though he may lack physical beauty. 
\par  On the other hand, an arrogant person is impaired in speech, failing to speak fluently or sincerely. His reas
oning is flawed. Instead of speaking candidly or purposefully, he speaks boastfully, so as to cover his flaws, or to earn the acclaim of others. This is why every sentence he utters is clearly lacking in wisdom, and thus, makes known his insincerity. Espe
cially, when his mistakes are made known, or when he is given advice he dislikes, the features mentioned above become even more obvious. 
\par Internal organs are also vulnerable to the negative effects of arrogance. As in the case of cigarettes and alcohol, the
 negative effects of stress, as a consequence of arrogance, become apparent over an extended period of time. Specialists have also linked many disorders to stress. The most observable consequences of stress are stomach aches, gastritis, and other disorder
s of digestive system. 
\par We need to remember that all these effects mentioned above can be observed only by an attentive eye. People having these traits may deny the existence of these symptoms or explain them away. Yet, a comparison between a believer, who 
is submissive to Allah, and an arrogant person, would make these physical and mental differences apparent. As one grows old, the differences become ever more apparent. Thus, an arrogant person causes the most damage to himself. Believers, on the other han
d
, lead a joyful and peaceful life, since they put their trust in Allah, and believe in the reality of fate. Of course, signs of aging will appear on them as well, yet, not to the extent of the harm of stress and the gloomy temperament of the arrogant. In 
this way, believers lead a happy life, both in this world and beyond...}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid10629049

nother form of arrogance, or considering oneself superior, is what we call the hidden arrogance. Generally, the attitudes of people with hidden arrogance vary gre
atly from that of the arrogant. The most significant difference between the two is that an arrogant person can be readily recognised from his outward appearance, whereas it is difficult for someone with hidden arrogance. 
\par Arrogant people commonly reveal th
eir arrogance by boasting openly. Yet, the other group of arrogant people conceal their arrogance. These people pay special attention to masking this reprehensible quality. Therefore, the question is: Why do they need to hide their arrogance? Why do they 
put such effort? 
\par There are various reasons for this. These people, who are more intelligent than arrogant people, are, in actuality, very well aware of what is right and wrong. For this reason, they can sense that arrogant manners are liable to produce und
esirable effects in others and upset them. Since they attach too much importance to the opinions of others, they prefer to hide their arrogance, and thereby, not lose their approval. They are well aware that being modest is recognised as a virtue and thus
 they pretend to be so. 
\par These people believe that they are the "most intelligent" and "the most upright." They deify themselves. Making a mistake or appearing incompetent hurts their pride. This being the case, they strive to maintain a perfect image in th
e eyes of people. That is why they do not want to be known as arrogant and feel ashamed if they sense that people have formed such an opinion about them. They fear losing the approval of others rather than fearing Allah and seeking His good pleasure alone
. 
\par One thing they enjoy is secretly mocking others. This is one way to satisfy their lower desires. Yet, they also pay meticulous attention not to make others notice this wickedness of theirs. 
\par Their method of concealing their arrogance is quite devious; pr
imarily, they try to put forth themselves as ideal people. It is essential for them to be known as "virtuous," being the reason why they aim to present themselves as "perfect" and "innocent." Earning the adulation and approval of others, to be admired by 
them, and thus, assuaging their arrogance becomes their main pursuit.
\par The arrogant boast continually, trying to bring attention with their qualities. People with hidden arrogance, however, avoid such overt attempts. Their schemes are more subtle, or more pr
ecisely, more wicked. They tend to create the appropriate conditions that will lead others to praise them. 
\par Such a type of arrogance is dangerous; it is something like an iceberg. (About 90 percent of its mass is below the surface of the water.) It is easy
 to avoid people who are arrogant, in common sense of the word, since they are easily recognised. But, it is otherwise with those who conceal their arrogance. Their arrogance becomes obvious only in time, making it more difficult to admonish to them or to
 explain to them the situation they are in. 
\par In general, this state of mind makes itself known after one has assumed a position of authority or responsibility; that is, by these circumstances, their hidden disease is accentuated. They attribute this respons
ibility to their superior features; and, it is quite difficult to persuade them otherwise. And, should they succeed at their task, they become excessively proud about it. 
\par There are many other situations that cause this hidden arrogance to surface. For ins
tance, upon losing his position of prestige, a person who appears modest outwardly may adopt an attitude otherwise unexpected of him; he may become introverted, diffident, and surly. This behaviour is telling marks of arrogance. A modest person' s tempera
m
ent never changes, no matter what happens to him. Such a person knows that there is good in whatever happens, and strives to earn the good pleasure of Allah no matter what the circumstances. As for an attitude to the contrary, however, it becomes obvious 
that the person in question attaches undue importance to prestige and status, thereby revealing his arrogance. 
\par A modest person, on the other hand, is one purified of all such manners. He is self-satisfied and at ease. Yet, it also deserves mention that ove
r-exaggerated modesty is also an important form of arrogance. Because, where modesty is valued, a person who nurtures hidden arrogance strives to earn the approval and appreciation of others by pretending to be modest. 
\par As we said earlier, hidden arrogance
 is dangerous, since it manifests itself in ways we do not expect. And, being confronted with a person' s hidden personality can be quite shocking. For instance, when faced with failure or criticism, a person who is not known to be arrogant may lose his t
e
mper and conduct himself quite unseemly. That is because, the idea of others being aware of his failure deeply hurts his pride. It may well be that his arrogance had never surfaced only because his wishes or expectations had never been challenged. However
, believing that he has lost all his prestige in the eyes of people, now he has no qualms about revealing his arrogance and wickedness, which had till then been hidden. 
\par Hidden arrogance may also appear in the form of acts of immorality. A person may lie in
 order to conceal his own imperfection, or he may try to make others' failures known to others in order to make himself appear better. Should a flaw of his be noticed, he would try to avoid all possible reactions, and defend his base nature. For this end,
 he resorts to evil methods, such as weeping or making others pity him. 
\par The arrogant express their discontent through silent protest; they give the cold shoulder, overreact, or become ill-tempered. Therefore, one who encounters such clear signs will easily
 be able to diagnose arrogance. In the case of hidden arrogance, however, almost all of these signs are not recognisable. Such people, by all appearances, are cheerful, and of normal vitality. Normally, their behaviour doesn' t betray a hint of deviousnes
s
. Even, in some cases, they pose modesty so successfully that they are able to fool others. However, these people have one distinguishing trait; an excessively high opinion of themselves. They somehow believe they are "the best" in either their profession
,
 at school, in their surroundings. And, this notion has even penetrated to their subconscious. As we said earlier, when they receive an undesired reaction, their real character surfaces; abruptly, they become belligerent. Falsely believing that they have 
b
een subjected to unfair treatment, they suffer an unhealthy mental state. This tendency is indicative of a weakness in them. Essentially, when they encounter something undesirable, their arrogance become evident and they begin to suffer a kind of "insanit

As these verses make clear, Satan' s greatest mistake was to arrive at erroneous conclusions and putting them into practice. This faulty reasoning is one of the fundamental characteristics of all who 
follow in the footsteps of Satan and become "devilishly arrogant." The detrimental effects of pride on a person are clearly demonstrated in the defiance of Satan, and those who followed him, to his Creator, the Almighty Allah. Maintaining a narrow outlook
 on things, evaluating everything from one' s own perspective, causes one to become deprived of insight. Such an outlook eventually makes a person apt to perceive and interpret things incorrectly.

orms. As is known, rather than employing what Allah has granted him to draw nearer to Him, and feeling grateful to Him, Satan became pretentious. Failing to consider that Allah could reduce him to insignificance whenever He wills, He revolted against Alla
h
' s command. Indeed, the adherents of Satan show forth this quality of his in many ways. For instance, though a person might render some service to Allah, he should consider this service as an opportunity granted by his Lord to earn His good pleasure. Oth

rwise, believing that one can attain success by one' s own efforts, without having been under Allah' s ordinance, and being boastful thereof, would be errant. Because, attributing that success to one' s own abilities, and being proud is a characteristic p

\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 One must remember that Satan approac
hes man stealthily, avoiding notice. He is in no hurry. With repetition and persistence, he can gradually deceive people, a method that proves successful over the long term. If one fails to be on the alert against this stealthy method of Satan, its effect
 
strengthens in time. For instance, if a person would enjoy some minor success, Satan would jump on the opportunity to tempt him. The insinuations made by Satan into the mind of that person would probably not include discernable expressions of arrogance. S
u
ch a person would, for instance, not openly say, "It is I alone who have accomplished this task." Satan employs a more deceptive strategy; he penetrates deeply into one' s heart, but gradually. If a person fails to recognise that his success belongs to no
 one but Allah alone, he, in time, starts to believe in his own abilities and think that he possesses power independent of Allah. 
\par If this sentiment turns into a permanent state of mind, conceit becomes one of his character traits. Such a person is a law un
to himself; he does what he considers right, and sees himself better and wiser than anyone else. The inner-voice that insinuates feelings of superiority in him becomes louder. A person infected in such a way suffers from detrimental spiritual afflictions.
 In time, his heart grows insensitive to Allah' s signs. Indeed, the Qur' an reveals that only those who are not vain can truly believe in Allah' s signs:

The character trait common to Pharaoh and other nations that perished before him is arrogance. The arrogance they harboured in their hearts prevented them from accepting Allah' s messenger and obeying him
. Their rejection only led them to torment both in this world and beyond. Further exploring the nature of the arrogance of Pharaoh, and considering the nations referred to in the Qur' an as those that have gone down in history for their arrogance, and the
ir relevance to our day, will help us better understand the importance of the subject. 
\par The attitude of Pharaoh and his people towards Allah' s messenger was common to all corrupted nations. Their arrogance reached to such an extent that they even dared to make a mockery of Allah' s messengers and the book he was sent with.

 s answer, no matter what. He was insistent on denying Allah' s might, despite all the signs he witnessed. Pharaoh responded to the message of Allah, communicated to him by Musa (as), with threats and abuse; he was angered to hear that Allah was the Lord 
o
f all humanity, both of the past and present. His insolence led him to accuse the messenger of insanity. Because he lacked wisdom, a quality peculiar to believers alone, he engaged himself in a struggle with Musa (as), yet, failed to remember one importan

Arrogance was the major reason behind Pharaoh' s denial. He insisted on denial, not because he failed to see or grasp the signs of faith, but because it hurt his sense of pride. His magicians' acknowledgment of Musa' s forthrightness and their embracing t
he faith had been a great sign for him. The miracles performed by Musa (as) too were sure signs. Anyone witnessing such miracles would normally come to believe in Allah. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 However, Pharaoh was devoid of a sound judgement, since his overbearing pride obscured
 his wisdom. The magicians' conversion to Musa' s religion did not make him reflect upon the extraordinary situation he had confronted. All that he could think about was that the magicians had embraced the faith without him authorizing them to do so. Phar
aoh' s ability to judge was severely obscured by his pride. This is why he insisted on denial, until death came upon him. 
\par The condition that led Pharaoh to disbelief holds true for every disbeliever. The reason of their denial is their overbearing pride. In the Qur' an, Allah describes these people as follows:

 suffer any loss, and We made a river flow right through the middle of them. He was a man of wealth and property and he said to his companion, debating with him, "I have more wealth than you and more people under me." He entered his garden and wronged him
self by saying, "I do not think that this will ever end. I do not think the Hour will ever come. But if I should be sent back to my Lord, I will definitely get something better in return." (Surat al-Kahf: 32-36)

d that his wealth was immune to time and disaster. 
\par This is a clear example showing the illogic of arrogant people; although the vineyard-owner claimed that his possessions were eternal, he did not explicitly deny the existence of Allah, and even considered
 the possibility of his having to return to Him. Interestingly, he falsely maintained that he would not be punished, but rather, would actually be rewarded if this were to really happen.
\par A similar line of thinking is also common in the arrogant people of t
oday. Although they do not openly deny the morality of religion, they are far from having fear of Allah in their hearts. Still, they falsely assume that they will somehow be saved, even if they are "sent back to their Lord." This example of the vineyard-o
wner, given in the Qur' an, clearly shows that such people lack wisdom. Such a person' s understanding is blurred by his arrogance, and he is hindered from grasping Allah' s infinite might.
\par The end met by the vineyard-owner, as Allah relates in the Qur' an, was also a note of caution. He lost all his wealth. He eventually said "if only...," but it was too late to be mindful:

One of the major reasons behind this mindset is their intolerance for the messengers because they were people chosen by Allah. They found it degrading to their status, reputation, wealth and
 honour to obey the messengers. This is why, throughout ages, ruling circles of disbelievers had always perceived the messengers as a threat to their established order, status and their image in the eyes of public. The divine message brought by the messen
gers caused them to reveal their pride and hatred towards them.
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\expnd1\expndtw5\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
In all ages, "the chiefs of the nations" have been referred to as the "elites" of societies. As is known, the "elite" is that group of people that enjoys superior social or economic status. As 
said earlier, such attributes cause pride and arrogance in disbelieving people who fail to employ their wisdom. Deriving power from this prosperity and social status, they exercise authority over the rest of the society. They have such a high opinion of t
h
emselves that they revolt against Allah and His messengers. Never do they accept the fact that superiority rests on one' s nearness to Allah rather than his power or prosperity. That is because, the acceptance of this truth would nullify their status. The
y
 are haughty, a quality which makes them deny the existence of Allah. Never do they consider that, all people, whether poor or wealthy, will ultimately be wrapped in a few metres of shroud, and that they will be reduced to a skeleton. Their possessions wi
ll bring no good to them in the hereafter. 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
In the Qur' an, Allah informs the believers about the main character traits of these chiefs of the nation that result from pride and arrogance-and thus, from disbelief. In this way, believers of all ages can come 
to know these people, who are apt to hinder them from their noble cause, and thus, they may take the necessary measures to protect themselves from them. Believers are also expected to draw lessons from their stories and to pay meticulous attention not to 
a
dopt a disposition similar to theirs. No one can absolve himself from the promises of the Qur' an, seeing himself as self-sufficient; believers must also reflect on the verses about disbelievers, and put forth effort to be purified of the errors peculiar 
to disbelievers. 
\par In the following section, we will consider the major character traits of the "elites" as told in the Qur' an.

being the case, they put forth a continuous effort to lead them astray. The people' s embracing of the faith means to them losing the grounds upon which they exercise their authority. Before all else, faith renders the worldly criteria maintained to presu
me superiority and false value judgments ineffective. Furthermore, in this manner the society can come to know the weaknesses of those to whom they had attached so much importance. Ultimately, no one will be left to exalt them, nor to submit to them. 

\par It is
 against the interests of the chiefs of the nation to lose the loyalty of their subordinates, those people they tend despise and consider as their inferiors. They want people to follow them, no matter what the consequences may be. Hence, they employ any m
ethod, threats, if necessary, to divert them from the morality and the way of living enjoined by the Qur' an. Some of the examples relating to such efforts of the chiefs of the nation are provided by the Qur' an:

 of showing sincere loyalty and obedience to Allah, they disobeyed their Lord' s commands, and wronged themselves by overstepping Allah' s limits:

Just like the nations of the past, the idolaters of Mecca also did not accept Muhammad (saas) as a prophet, out of their conceit and desire for fallacious superiority. They maintained that the Prophet was a poet, although t
hey did not themselves believe it. Furthermore, they alleged that he himself fabricated all the things he told, and thus, accused him of lies.
\par The similarity of these slanders to the words of the former nations, demonstrates that this is part of Allah' s i
mmutable law. Yet, there is another immutable law of Allah: according to which, both in this world and beyond, Allah humiliates and inflicts punishment upon those who deny His messengers, and become arrogant towards them...
\par The similarity of the words used
 by all nations to confront their messengers is quite striking. A time difference of hundreds of years, even cultural and geographical dissimilarities, does not matter. Disbelievers, of all ages, who failed to see or ignored the truth because of their arr
ogance, shared a common character trait. They all followed the same pattern and adopted the very same tactics. Surely, their ends corresponded to their behaviour, and ultimately, they were repaid with humiliating punishment.

 refused to prostrate himself to the Prophet Adam. Being aware of Allah' 
s infinite might, it was illogical for him to openly claim superiority over Allah. But, it was his pride that was hurt. It was the Prophet Adam to whom he showed arrogance, and thereby exposed his rebellious intent towards Allah. 
\par Consequently, arrogance, which is, in actuality, a sin against Allah, manifests itself during the relations of one person with another. 
\par Surely, modesty also manifests itself under the same conditions. Believers show their submission to Allah by behaving modestly towards His belie
ving servants. Aware of the fact that they are not responsible for the creation of their qualities, they are grateful to Allah, and never forget that Allah may reclaim any of these at any time. Fearing punishment from their Creator, Who is the Possessor o
f infinite power, they take refuge in no one but Him. This submissiveness of the believers, and their fear of Allah, is related in a verse as follows:

 outcome of their submissiveness to Allah. The fact that they have grasped the secret of this world, that is, understood the existence and might of Allah, accounts for their modesty. 
\par As a result, the true modesty we are discussing in this book can only be attained through faith. 
\par It is impossible to attain true modesty through another means than faith. Because, in a society composed of disbelievers, those who are seen as "modest" are, usually, those perceived as lacking "confidence." Because most attach to
o much importance to worldly things, those who are successful in attaining them become boastful, while those who cannot are deemed to be weak and insecure. Therefore, the wealthy tend to be arrogant, whereas the poor are considered insecure. However, we n
eed to underline that this lack of "self-confidence" is a disposition nothing near what is true modesty, a form of behaviour which is noble and dignified. 
\par The story of Qarun, as narrated in the Qur' an, sets a good example of what we discussed above. In ad
dition to Qarun, who was excessively proud about his wealth and possessions, the Qur' an also informs us about those who longed for that which he possessed. In addition to these, another group were the true believers who grasped the secret of faith:

un' s belongings were not as proud as he; or, they might have lacked "self-assurance." Yet, if they had been in his shoes, they would, most probably, also have been as arrogant as Qarun. That is because, just as Qarun had, they failed to grasp that the re
al owner of everything is Allah. They only grasped this fact when they witnessed the end of Qarun. 
\par The truly modest ones were the believers who "had been given knowledge," that is, those who had grasped the secret of life. Aware that what Qarun possessed w
as temporal, and thereby, unimportant, they did not yearn for his possessions. In any case, owning a wealth the likes of Qarun' s would not have hampered their dignity or humility. 
\par These "people of knowledge," as mentioned in the story of Qarun, are role-
models for all Muslims to emulate. They show that real modesty can only be attained by being a servant to Allah, and that Allah bestows His blessings only on His noble servants. That is because, they are those "who do not seek to exalt themselves on the e
arth or cause corruption in it." They do not become arrogant, but feel grateful for the blessings granted them. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid4539855

d, at the same time, perform that which is entailed by the morality commanded in the Qur' an. That is because, the most fundamental principle of Allah' s religion is to acknowledge Allah' s might and to take only Him as a god. An arrogant person, however,
 
considers himself as a being apart and independent of Allah, and seeks to satisfy his own whims and desires. Failing to grasp that he is a servant of Allah, he glorifies himself with what Allah has granted him and becomes arrogant. In other words, he deif
ies himself. 
\par That is why arrogance hinders one from living by the principles of the religion and leads him to commit a form of idolatry. 
\par Deifying himself, an arrogant person contradicts the very basic principle of the true religion; that there is no god b
ut Him. Consequently, such a mindset prevents the arrogant from living according to the morality of the religion. Not surprisingly, the arrogant commonly have no intention of living by the religion, except for a certain group of people, which will be desc
ribed in the following pages. Many verses in the Qur' an describe the resistance of the arrogant against the morality of the religion and their rejection of it:

\par The morality of religion calls for modesty and submission to Allah. An arrogant person, however, lacks the virtue of a believer, and thus, fails to attain any depth of faith.
\par An important sign of modesty is one' s obedience to Allah and His messenger. The fact that an arrogant person cannot show wholehearted obedience in that way, once again, reveals that religion and arrogance are incompatible. The arrogant do no

ho may know better.
\par As is known, the hidden arrogance of Satan finally made itself known when he was ordered to show obedience. Because of his arrogance, he desisted and thus became one of the disbelievers. In the Qur' an, Allah places particular emphasis o
n obedience and gives a detailed account of the sort of obedience a believer must adopt. As Allah defines in the Qur' an, obedience is a very important issue that calls for wholehearted submission and compliance. A person' s outward compliance with the me
ssenger' s decision should also be accompanied with wholehearted submission:

As said earlier, an important sign of the arrogant is their rejection of Allah' s messengers. They struggled against these messengers, since the thought of obeying a person who is virtuous only b
y his moral excellence, wisdom and faith, and who was sent as a leader to every member of that society, hurt their pride. However, disobedience of the messengers is disobedience of Allah. And, disobedience of Allah, ultimately, brings about a lapse in the
 practise of religion in a society. It has been revealed in many verses that obedience of the messenger is, in fact, obedience of Allah. A verse reads as follows:

As made explicit in this and similar verses, obedience is analogous to a fortress that shuts out the arrogant from the realm of religion. Only modesty, submission and humility can open the gates of this castle.
\par I
n addition, arrogance is a disease that dulls all moral qualities and hardens one' s heart. That is, apart from being a distasteful quality, the other character traits caused by arrogance wholly contradict the moral excellence commanded by the Qur' an. A 
b
eliever is generous, self-sacrificing, patient, compassionate, committed, loyal and tolerant. An arrogant person, however, can never master these superior moral qualities in their true sense. He is stingy, selfish, impatient, inconsiderate and unjust. Sur
ely, his character prevents him from properly fulfilling the commands of religion. Indeed, the primary purpose of the morality of religion is to help man to attain the moral excellence with which Allah is pleased.

Throughout this book, we have stressed that an arrogant person cannot be sincere about living by the principles of religion, and that the character of an arrogant person is entirely incompatible with the model
 of faith described in the Qur' an. Yet, there are some who claim otherwise; that is, there are certain "hypocrites" who harbour excessive arrogance in themselves, although they maintain that they live by the morality of Islam. 
\par This has not been an uncomm
on assertion in the history of Islam. In the Qur' an, Allah informs us that such people have existed throughout history, including the time of the Prophet Muhammad (saas). The Qur' an offers a detailed account of the basic character traits of hypocrites, 
to make known the true face of these people, and thereby, to protect believers from their ploys. 
\par In the Qur' an, Allah tells about a group of people among the believers who maintained that they believed, although, in actuality, they did not. These possesse
d all the character traits peculiar to the arrogant, like disobedience and disloyalty. These people were the hypocrites. For their personal reasons, hypocrites remain within the company of the believers, but hide their disbelief. However, they can be read
i
ly discerned by their manners and attitude that greatly differ from that of believers. The Qur' an outlines the attitude, behaviour, and language typical of hypocrites. In this way, it becomes quite easy for believers to distinguish who are the hypocrites
. 
\par The main reason why we should now consider the hypocrites is that this group, distinguished by their arrogance and conceit, provide an example of the fact that the arrogant are unable to even pretend to live by the principles of the religion. Indeed, the
 hypocrites fail to comply with many commands revealed in the Qur' an, obedience and respect to the messenger being the foremost of them. Outwardly, they fulfil many acts of worship, yet, they perform them reluctantly, thus revealing their inner motives. 

\par In the following pages, in light of the verses of the Qur' an, we will examine the reasons why the arrogant cannot live by the principles of the religion, and what sort of inconsistencies appear when they attempt to.

In the previous sections, we stressed that arrogance is a character trait peculiar to Satan. Satan, who is, in actuality, a being that is quite capable of appreciating the infinite might of Allah, has entirely abandoned his r
eason, and thus, has adopted a totally unfounded line of reasoning. For this reason, he dared to rebel against Allah. In the same manner, the arrogant suffer from a lack of understanding. The Prophet Muhammad (saas) describes this heedless situation of a

or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will be unjust to them? No, it is simply that they are wrongdoers. (Surat an-Nur: 48-50)

\par In this section, we explained that it is difficult, and even impossible, for arrogant people to live by the principles of religion. We said that those who are arrogant and f
eel proud cannot even imitate a devout person. Even those who are talented may be able to imitate the character traits of a believer for a certain period of time, but their true character will eventually show forth when they feel their interests are at st
ake. 
\par The sincere modesty and humility of a person is a sign of his devotion. Similarly, the arrogance of a person who claims he is a believer indicates his hypocrisy, or at least his inclination to hypocrisy. 
\par To conclude, an arrogant person can never live
 by the principles of the religion in its true sense. Even if he were to memorize the entire book of Allah, it would not matter. On the contrary, he is held even more responsible since he does not practise the commands of which he is aware. Ultimately, he
 
belittles himself to the point where he lives the religion as a hypocrite. To be a sincere Muslim, he must first quit idolizing his lower-self, and abandon pride and arrogance. That is, he must become conscious of his weaknesses and status as servant of A
llah. The pure religious outlook can only be grounded on such a foundation. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid16203673

While the arrogant are sent to Hell, those who admired them, and thus, followed these insolent people, will also be cast into Hellfire. These are the people who obeyed the arrogant people because they admired the
ir worldly qualities. Although not as arrogant as those who possessed "Pharaonic arrogance," those who followed in their footsteps lacked character and willpower. Another trait of theirs is their failure to put their trust in Allah, and their being driven

s we have stressed throughout this book, the fundamental character trait of an arrogant person is his failure to remember that he is a weak and mortal being before Allah. Whatever the conditions and circumstances may be, he finds justification to become v
ainly proud. This supposed justification may be a beautiful house, expensive furniture, a sports car, clothes, his hair style, the colour of his eyes, physical beauty, status, fame, a prestigious family name...
\par However, never does he ponder over the significance of the verse, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \b\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 "Every self will taste death"}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332  }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ab\af0

and remember that he will die and be reduced to dust. Everything he once valued will meet the same end; his body, to which he was fondly attached, will first decay, and then be reduc
ed to bones. His new car will become a heap of metal in only a few decades. Probably, in a few years time, no one will remember his enviable fame or status. Moreover, in a hundred years or more, not a soul will remain on earth that will have known him. Hi
s failure to grasp these facts, and, moreover, his refusal to contemplate them, is, in actuality, a clear sign of his being one of the people who does not use his intellect. 
\par However, failure to use one' s intellect is not a reason to exonerate a person. Th
at is because, Allah created every soul and shown him the two highways, two goals; a soul can either wholeheartedly submit to his Lord and spend his entire life to earn the rewards of Paradise, or follow his whims and desires and grow arrogant towards Him
. Allah increases one' s wisdom if he adheres to the first way; the second way, on the other hand, deprives him of wisdom. As was the case with }{\rtlch\fcs1 \ai\af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \i\f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Iblis}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0

s a basis to suppose their superiority over others. The modest are aware of their own shortcomings, weaknesses, their vulnerability even to a microbe otherwise invisible to the naked eye, and their mortality. They also recognise the fact that, like themse
lves, others are also subjects of Allah. They know that in Allah' s sight, only fear of Allah is the criteria for superiority, and accept no other criteria.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Every detail in this universe points to a superior creation. By contrast, materialism, which seeks to deny the fact of creation in the universe, is nothing but an unscientific fallacy. 

\par Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matter through coinc
idences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by Allah. American astrophysicist Hugh Ross explains this as follows: 
\par Atheism, Darwinism, and virtually all the "isms" emanating from the eighteenth to the twentieth century p
hilosophies are built upon the assumption, the incorrect assumption, that the universe is infinite. The singularity has brought us face to face with the cause \endash  or causer \endash 
 beyond/behind/before the universe and all that it contains, including life itself.1
\par It is Allah Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail. Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by Allah, but are products of coincidences, to be true.
\par Unsurprisingly, when we look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances
 
which atoms rest upon, and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with t
hem.
\par This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century. 
\par We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so. However, we think that, considering its importance, it will be helpful to make a short summary here as well.

t made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled The Origin of Species published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Da
rwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. 
\par Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the lon
g chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution.

 a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the fi
rst step of the alleged evolutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated c
oincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailab
le rules of biology.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontan
eous generation, the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were 
conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to 
the naked eye. 
\par Even in the period when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, L
ouis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said, "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous genera
tion recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment."2
\par Advocates of the theory of evolution resisted the findings of Pasteur for a long time. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being
, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian
 biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: 
"Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the evolution of organisms."3
\par Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve the problem of the origin of life. 
The best known of these experiments was carried out by American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesiz
ed several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins. 
\par Barely a few years had passed before it was revealed that this experiment, which was then presented as an important step in the name of evolution, was invalid, the atmosphere used in the experiment having been very different from real earth conditions.4

\par After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic.5
\par All the evolutionist efforts put forth throughout the twentieth century to explain the origin of life ended with failure. The geochemist Jeffrey Bada from San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth Magazine in 1998:

\par Today as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth?6

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a big impasse about the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed
 the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing 
inorganic materials together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for a
n average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is practically considered to be impossible.
\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incre
dible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volumes of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only repli
cate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings th
e scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine:
\par It is extremely improba
ble that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life 
could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. 7
\par No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was "created" in a supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in real
ity, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection". The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means Of Natural Selection\'85
\par Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can ru
n faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. 
\par Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book The Origin of Species:
\par Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur.8

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 
So, how could these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living cre
atures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as 
they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book The Origin of Species, for instance, said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.9
\par However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Mendel and verified by the science of genetics that flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent gener
ations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favour as an evolutionary mechanism.

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of t
he 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par Today, the m
odel that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, lungs, and wi
ngs, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:
\par First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they
 are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there wo
uld be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.10
\par Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All m
utations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human being
s
 is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since n
o evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken place.

the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. 
\par According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else in time and all s
pecies have come into being in this way. According to the theory, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. 
\par Had this been the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have exis
ted some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary 
creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as "transitional forms." 
\par If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In The Origin of Species, Darwin explained:

\par If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... Consequently, evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains.11

However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the 19th century all over the world, no transitional f
orms have yet been uncovered. All the fossils unearthed in excavations showed that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. 
\par A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist:
\par The point emerges that if we examine the fossil record in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find - over and over again - not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another.12
\par This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, it is very strong evidence that living beings are crea
ted. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor can be that this species was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma:

\par Crea
tion and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some proces
s of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence.13
\par Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the earth. That means that "the origin of species" is, contrary to Darwin's supposition, not evolution but creation.

The subject most often brought up by the advocates of the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. The Darwinist claim holds that 
the modern men of today evolved from some kind of ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, it is claimed that there existed some "transitional forms" between modern man and his 
ancestors. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic "categories" are listed: 
\par 1. Australopithecus 
\par 2. Homo habilis
\par 3. Homo erectus
\par 4. Homo sapiens
\par Evolutionists call the so-called first ape-like ancestors of men "Australopithecus" which m
eans "South African ape." These living beings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famous anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zu
ckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, has shown that these belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans.14
\par Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as "homo," that is "man." According to the evolution
ist claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular order. This scheme is imaginary because it has nev
e
r been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the most important proponents of the theory of evolution in the 20th century, contends in his book One Long Argument that "particularly historical [pu
zzles] such as the origin of life or of Homo sapiens, are extremely difficult and may even resist a final, satisfying explanation."15
\par By outlining the link chain as "Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens," evolutionists imply that ea
ch of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time.16
\par Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co-existed in the same region.17
\par This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another. A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution although he is an evolutionist himself:

\par What has become of our ladder if there are three coe
xisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? Moreover, none of the three display any evolutionary trends during their tenure on earth.18
\par Put briefly, the scenario of human ev
olution, which is sought to be upheld with the help of various drawings of some "half ape, half human" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific ground. 
\par Lord Solly
 Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years, and particularly studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that the
re is, in fact, no such family tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man. 
\par Zuckerman also made an interesting "spectrum of science." He formed a spectrum of sciences ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. Ac
cording to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most "scientific"-that is, depending on concrete data-fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part
 considered to be most "unscientific," are "extra-sensory perception"-concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense\endash and finally "human evolution." Zuckerman explains his reasoning:
\par We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of pre
sumed biological science, like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man's fossil history, where to the faithful [evolutionist] anything is possible - and where the ardent believer [in evolution] is sometimes able to believe several contradicto
ry things at the same time.19
\par The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory.

\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af0 \ltrch\fcs0 \f0\insrsid8723988\charrsid9076332 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of "how we see". Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the 
retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the brain as an image after a 
series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the c
entre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even th
e technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at an
y
 other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, coloured, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousan
d
s of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will 
see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective having depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have 
tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The
 background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim th
at the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that
 produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye co
uld not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sen
ds these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from so
und just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from
 sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. 

\par As is
 the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this 
t
echnology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by 
t
he biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of
 
the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of ma
n.
\par So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this.

\par The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, yo
u
 will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro-chemical nervous impulses as images, sounds, odours and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this w
i
thout feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? There is no doubt that this consciousness does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe
 that everything is comprised of matter, cannot give any answer to these questions. 
\par For this consciousness is the spirit created by Allah. The spirit needs neither the eye to watch the images, nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, nor does it need the brain to think. 
\par Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty Allah, should fear Him and seek refuge in Him, He Who squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimetres in a three-dimensional, c

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a claim evidently at variance with scientific findings. The theory's claim on the origin of life is inconsistent w
ith science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the intermediate forms required by the theory never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an u
nscientific idea. This is how many ideas such as the earth-centered universe model have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is pressingly kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against the theory as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that the theory of evolution is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism beca
use it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward for the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":
\par It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced b
y our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absol
ute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 20
\par These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it arg
ues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the interactions between mat
ter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, etc., out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at th
e origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed
 it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.

and logic, will clearly understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible.
\par As has been explained above, those who believe in the theory o
f evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors, university students, scientists such as Einstein and Galileo, artists such as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Pavarotti, as well as an
t
elopes, lemon trees and carnations. Moreover, the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people. That is why it is quite justifiable to speak of the theory of evolution as "the most potent spell in history." Never before has a
n
y other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from them as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians 
worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of the Prophet Ibrahim worshipping idols they had made with their own hands or the people of the Prophet Musa worshipping the Golden Calf.

\par In fact, this situation is a lack of reason pointed to by Allah in the Qur'an. He reveals in many verses that some peoples' minds will be closed and that they will be powerless to see the truth. Some of these verses are as follows:

g

iousness, the planet Earth with all its features so perfectly suited to life, and living things full of countless complex systems. 
\par In fact, Allah reveals in the Qur'an in the incident of the Prophet Musa and Pharaoh that some people who support atheistic p
hilosophies actually influence others by magic. When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told the Prophet Musa to meet with his own magicians. When the Prophet Musa did so, he told them to demonstrate their abilities first. The verses continue:

 seen, Pharaoh's magicians were able to deceive everyone, apart from the Prophet Musa and those who believed in him. However, the evidence put forward by the Prophet Musa broke that spell, or "swallowed up what they had forged" as the verse puts it.

\par We revealed to Musa, "Throw down your staff." And it immediately swallowed up what they had forged. So the Truth took place and what they did was shown to be false. (Surat al-A'raf: 117-119)

end their lives defending them abandon them, they too will be humiliated when the full truth emerges and the spell is broken. In fact, Malcolm Muggeridge, an atheist philosopher and supporter of evolution admitted he was worried by just that prospect:

\par I mys
elf am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it's been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books in the future. Posterity will marvel that so very flimsy and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with 
the incredible credulity that it has. 21
\par That future is not far off: On the contrary, people will soon see that "chance" is not a god, and will look back on the theory of evolution as the worst deceit and the most terrible spell in the world. That spell is 
already rapidly beginning to be lifted from the shoulders of people all over the world. Many people who see the true face of the theory of evolution are wondering with amazement how it was that they were ever taken in by it.
