\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ord," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one sin\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
gle goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wid\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bos

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
se who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 inds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chao\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ople from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifeste

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideol
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ogical defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service mu

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

r is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of God, during the last 140 years it has cause
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter

In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to other
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , one of the most effective methods is encouraging

n the previous section, we stated that the true good word is the one which calls to Allah's religion, and is a reminder of the Hereafter. This call is a very imp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Allah makes believers aware of this responsibility. However, the majority of people fail to recognize that summoning others to faith in Allah is an important responsibility and a form of worship. Essentially, they are unaware of this responsibility. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ost evident sign of this ignorance is people's failure to adopt moral excellence, and encouraging it among others. Those who have moral failings, who earn their living through illicit means, who strive to spread immorality and see compassion, mercy, chari
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y and respect as weakness, are in the majority. Even though there are those among them who are aware of what is good, they avoid the responsibility of enjoining it. Instead, they turn a blind eye to the facts, preferring to abstain from involvement. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
it should be noted here that what we have said above holds true for those who do not "believe with certainty," and fail to heed the word of Allah, for true believers are conscious of the importance of this important responsibility described in the followi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 (Surah Al `Imran, 114). For this reason, believers summon all around them to nurture consciousness of All\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On hearing the call, for instance, a person may immediately come to have faith in Allah, while an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
iever. No matter what the reaction, what is important for him is to retain the morality which is pleasing to Allah, to not swerve from moral excellence under any circumstance, and to put his trust in Allah. For, whether important or minor, each incident t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at takes place in this world is preordained by Allah, and it is Allah alone Who can guide a person to the truth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For this reason, the reactions and responses of disbelievers never demoralize the believers. In the Qur'an, Allah provides many examples of th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is. In the verse, }{
\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "But would you, perhaps, torment yourself to death with grief over them if they are not willing to believe in this message?"}{\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat al-Kahf, 6), Allah addressed our Prophet (saas), informing him that he should not grieve over the disbelie\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f of people. In another verse Allah says, }{\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697

As the verse maintains, those who fail to see the truth, and, thereby, cannot heed admonitions, are described as "the blind." Surely, no one would like to be blind when they could be of those who can see. Therefore, they would not wish to be blind either 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n the spiritual sense of the term. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For this reason, a person of conscience would regard a warning while still in this world as a great blessing, especially if the admonition issues from a believer, who warns him in the light of Allah's verses. A conscient
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ious person does not offer any excuses, or strives to exonerate himself. For as the verse }{\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "\'85\loch\f0  The self indeed commands to evil acts}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In everyday life, people are confronted with many such examples. For instance, a person may act in a way that is offensive towards someone else, and a believer witnessing his error may remind him that his behavior is inappropriate, and that he ought to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
maintain his composure under all circumstances, as this is a command from Allah. In such a situation, through the evil insinuations of the lower-self, the person in question might have actually thought that he was acting correctly. However, the faithful, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eing aware of this tendency of the lower-self, do not heed these evil suggestions. Relying always on their conscience, they recognize the truth and comply with it. Even if they are in the right, they do not try to exonerate themselves. Thinking that there
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is always a better and more perfect way of behaving, they aim to do better at the next opportunity. One who is faithful knows very well that the excuses issuing from his lower-self will be of no avail in the Hereafter, and that disregarding its insinuatio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s and instead obeying the good word, is what will bring him benefit. For, as the Qur'an refers to the Day of Judgment as }{\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"the Day when the excuses of the wrongdoers will not help them."}{\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surah Ghafir, 52)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this way, that is, through awareness of the Day \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of Judgment, thereby being willing to adhere to one another's counsel, believers address one another's shortcomings, and thus advance towards perfection in their morality. Something that goes unnoticed by one is recognized by another. Most importantly, no
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 believer shows the slightest adverse reaction to such warnings. Indeed, in the Qur'an, believers are described as those who }{\b\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"... do not knowingly persist in what they were doing." }{\f0\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 (Surah Al `Imran, 135) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Contrary to the reactions of those who are ignorant \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of the religion, the faithful never respond to an admonition with haughtiness, arrogance, or such deviant mindsets issuing from the lower-self. Both the one who enjoins it, and the one who complies with it, submit to the good word, without hesitation, for
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they fear Allah and seek His good pleasure. Such moral excellence is a blessing, granted by Allah only to His modest and obedient servants. As a result, believers benefit also from the blessings brought about by mutual friendship, brotherhood, modesty and
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sincerity.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
It is not only the weaknesses, shortcomings or mistakes which believers warn one another about. Their common goal is to earn Allah's good pleasure. They already possess admirable qualities like good morality, spiritual profundity, and sincerity.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 However, they are not self-satisfied with these; they still aim to better themselves, and encourage one another to this end. And, no matter what the issue, believers heed advice with submission every time they receive it, for they know that these words a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d solutions are from the Qur'an, and are means to help them attain Paradise. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another factor which makes these admonitions beneficial is the believers' aim of seeking Allah's good pleasure, rather than the approval of others, and their determination in tel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ling the truth. This is also the case with those matters which go against one's lower-self. What is important is the benefit their words will bring; they aim to be instrumental in the correction of the other person's mistakes, and allowing him to draw nea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er to Allah. To this end, believers state frankly what is good, without hesitation. Yet, behind this frankness, there is always respect, compassion and mercy. Before offering some advice with regard to some weakness or failure, stated in the light of the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Q\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ur'an, they first consider how they are to say such things so as to be most effective and beneficial. When speaking, they try to be easy on the believers, though through with the "best words," they reflect, and plan, striving always to be helpful to other
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 believers. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Surely, none except sincere believers, who seek Allah's good pleasure, show forth such sensitivity. As long as their personal well-being is not in detriment, those who do not live by the religion never aim to correct others' mistakes and weakne
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sses. The faults of others, despite the regret and shame they will entail on the Day of Judgment, do not concern them. For, they pursue nothing but the mundane things of this world. If they are required to admonish another for some reason, they are not ca

eful of the words they use, but say whatever comes to their minds, thereby causing anxiety for the other party. However, their normal course is to not interfere with anyone. For, to criticize someone, to admonish them, telling them that they need to refor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  a particular mode of behavior, are difficult tasks, since such attempts will often entail a negative reaction from the other.

the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's }{\i\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697

created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any desi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piec

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 1050 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias c

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA.

 the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserte
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generat

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\fs22\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions for\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact

\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid14702162\charrsid11304697 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains una\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's reti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
na. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this techni
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 al background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the da
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreov
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 aper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image ha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pplies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any so\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
und in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 owded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and repr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
oduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 deavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest}{
