\par }{\f0\fs22\cf1\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\emdash 
and therefore, Allah\rquote s Existence\emdash over the last 140 years it 
has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think 
it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par All the author\rquote s books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur\rquote anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah\rquote s words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah\rquote s verses are exp
lained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader\rquote s mind. The books\rquote 
 sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, the
y can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author\rquote 
s books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author\rquote s personal views,
 explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul\rquote 
s Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he ha
s published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody 
ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par His penname is a composite of the names }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 Harun}{\f0\fs22\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871  (Aaron) and }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 Yahya}{\f0\fs22\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 
 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people\rquote s lack of faith. The Prophet\rquote s seal on the his books\rquote  covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur\rquote 
an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur\rquote an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose
 to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the \'93
last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par All of Harun Yahya\rquote s works share one single goal: to convey the Qur\rquote  an\rquote s message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah\rquote s Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems
\rquote  feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German,
 Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books\rquote  wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that\rquote 
s easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any othe
r perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ide
ologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par This is no doubt a result of the Qur\rquote an\rquote s wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity\rquote s search for Allah\rquote s right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people\rquote s minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people\rquote 
s hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author\rquote s literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can r
eadily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya\rquote s books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur\rquote an\rquote s moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers\rquote  conviction. 
\par One point should be kept in mind: The main reason f
or the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur
\rquote anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 

\par In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur\rquote an.

\rquote s appointed angels are constantly monitoring and inscribing everything that you do. The moment you say a word they writ
e it down. Your every step, every thought, everything that you do, including obligations which have been postponed, are all recorded without omission.
\par These angels do not discriminate between minor or major actions. Even when you are
 asleep they are constantly with you. They fulfil their obligations without error. They are never forgetful or erroneous, they carry out their task faultlessly. By the same token, your appointed angels of death are also waiting. What are they waiting for?
 For your predestined time to be fulfilled. When your appointed time of death reaches you, it is they who will take delivery of your soul.
\par As well as these, there are other witnesses which we have not yet mentioned, the ones you do not think about, these are your secret witnesses; your hands and skin. On the Day of Judgment, all these witnesses will congregate, and with Allah\rquote 
s permission they will speak and give their testimony about you. If you happen to be one of those who did not fear Allah, or if you were not a cautious person they will, testify against you.
\par Humanity has been created to worship Allah and is constantly being tested. A person\rquote s temporal existence on average is about sixty years, it is not much time before one is eventually brought before Allah to give account for every second of one
\rquote s life. When everyone learns of what they have earned on Earth through the evidence provided by these witnesses, Allah will then decide on the kind of eternal life appropriate for them. If a person possesses goo
d deeds he will be given his Book in his right hand and that person will be eternally saved. However, if he is among those whose Books are given in their left hands, he will then say:

\par The reason behind this terrible end, is that people never imagined that their every action would be recorded and would one day be revealed and accounted for, hence they passed their lives carelessly without fearing All
ah or His warnings. A person such as this who does not possess a definite form of belief in the Hereafter, in the Day of Judgment or in a terrorizing place of punishment for wrong actions and careless behavior, like Hell, will not mind ignoring Allah
\rquote s boundaries.
\par This is why fear of Allah is a very strong indicator of faith in Allah and an important indicator of what to expect in the eternal Hereafter. The only way to safety is founded upon fearful awareness of Allah and scrupulous caution. 
\par The Day of Jud
gment is a fearsome reality to be reflected upon with awe so that it becomes impossible to remain unaffected by it. However, this fear is only applicable to people of faith and is a particular type of fear because Allah has described what will happen on t
he Day of Judgment in numerous Qur\rquote anic verses; the scribes, witnesses and the enormous congregation of people. This is an absolute certainty, which is unconditionally accepted by true believers who are fearful of facing such a terrifying ordeal.

\par Everything you do is immediately recorded, even as you are reading this book. You are fast approaching the day when you will be called by Allah to account for your actions. So we hope to be amongst those who have earned Allah\rquote 
s pleasure through fearful awareness of Him:

To avoid confusion with other earthly fears, Allah has also described in the Qur\rquote an the emotions and state of spirituality of a believer who fears Allah. A believer\rquote s fear of Allah is a fear that does not resemble any other fe

reness and the intellect. This fear enables a person to attain a very high level of upright conduct. 
\par This fear will increase a believer\rquote s ardent desire for the Hereafter and incite hope and eagerness. Fear of Allah also increases many times over a believer\rquote

at love or, worse still, arouse the displeasure or enmity of their Most Beloved, Allah. 
\par Fear of Allah is inextricably linked to love of Allah. Love of Allah can only be achieved with nearness to Allah, which becomes a reality when one develops an intimate 
and sincere attachment to Him. However, nearness to Allah is not possible without His love and approval, and this is gained by protecting His boundaries and fulfilling His commands. This however, is not a position that can be arrived at without first esta
b
lishing fear of Allah, because the soul of a person who does not fear Allah will constantly be drawn towards doing things which Allah does not approve of and being neglectful and indifferent towards those things which Allah desires of us. It is for this r
eason that the only way to gain Allah\rquote s approval is through fear of Him. 
\par This order of things is established by Allah. Hence, to imagine that one will earn His love and approval before one has acquired fear of Him is a sign of great self-deception. Before 
all else, Allah has ordered people to fear Him. To overlook this imperative and to say that one only needs to love Allah makes no sense. People who assert that they love Allah whilst they remain indifferent to what may be displeasing to Him are, in realit
y
, deceiving themselves in their attempts to ease their own consciences. The love of Allah they refer to is a figment of their imagination and is superficial in nature. People who truly love Allah are extremely meticulous and decisive when it comes to the 
matter of adhering to His commands and prohibitions. Arguing that fear of Allah is unnecessary is in fact no different from saying, \'93there is no need for fasting, prayer and worship.\'94
 Such people resort to a variety of excuses not only on the matter of fearing Allah but also in order avoid fulfilling many of Allah\rquote s other commands.

Death is a reality. On average, a person will remain on Earth for approximately sixty years following which the eternal life commences. This eternal life will be lived either in the Garden (Paradise) endowed with endless blessings, or in t
he Fire (Hell), which has been created especially to inflict pain on body and soul. Whenever Allah wills, He can end a person\rquote 
s life on Earth and move him to the Hereafter and there is no doubt that this decision can become a reality within a blink of an eye. 
\par A person can never know when he will die, the time his trial will end or the moment of his final judgment. As a result he should be quite fearful and cautious about being caught out unprepared when that moment arrives, being unable to account for his 
actions and being burdened with obligations that he has either neglected or postponed and not taken seriously. When the angels of death arrive there is no further possibility to complete unfinished obligations or to compensate for work that should have be
en completed. The deeds done up to that moment will either be to one\rquote s profit or loss and one will be called to account and held responsible for them or rewarded for them, as the case may be.

they can never truly appreciate these characteristics because the moment they meet with a conflict of interest they will inevitably sink to the level of their own immediate advantage, instead of rising to the best of conduct as described in the Qur

True believers who are fearfully aware of Allah are extremely sensitive when it comes to receiving a response from Him. When any negative incident happens to them or when they feel their work is going badly, or when they are experiencing distr

 Dawud realized that We had put him to the test. He begged forgiveness from his Lord and fell down prone, prostrating, and repented. So We forgave him for that and he has nearness to Us and a good Homecoming. (Surah Sad: 21-25)

Allah as He should be measured, who fear the loss of His approval because of their love and awe of Him.

ed infinite goodness will also begin to manifest. As a result of abundance and beauty being amongst the foremost features of the Garden, Allah will provide His beloved, fearful servants with a taste of these blessings during their lives on Earth in order 
to increase their longing and desires for the Garden. 
\par By the same token, Allah will protect the believers from every form of anxiety and distress during their lives because of their adherence to His commands and prohibitions, because of their living accord
ing to His religion and, most importantly, because of their constant reliance on Him, their patience, and their longing for the Hereafter. Instead of distress, Allah causes to descend upon their hearts a feeling of peace and security. In every act of wors
h
ip or good conduct, big or small, they are aware that Allah is watching them and, that the recording angels record it all in the book of their deeds, hence, they experience a tranquillity that is brought about by the knowledge that in the Hereafter they w
ill be rewarded for it all. 
\par On the other hand, however, there is another point that should not be forgotten: the world is a place of trial. Most certainly, a true believer could be confronted with various hardships and crises. However, whatever the situati
on, for a believer who fears Allah these difficulties turn out to be a mercy and a reward. A good example of this is the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) (as) who, having been accused of lying and in spite of being on the point of being thrown into the fire by h
is people, he did not make even the slightest compromise in his beliefs or waver in his submission or in his trust in Allah.
\par Without doubt being burnt alive is a terrible punishment but in the case of Prophet Ibrahim (as) Allah had ordered the fire to be \'93coolness and peace\'94
 for him and it did not cause him any pain or suffering. Distress, harm and misfortune are a punishment or warning which occur only as a result of a person\rquote s own incorrect manner and bad behavior: }{

\par Otherwise, for a sincere believer who fears Allah to the best of his ability and who is constantly mindful of Allah\rquote s approval in his conduct, punishment is not an issue. 
\par All the hardships which t
rue believers experience in this world are confronted as tests which only enhance the respect and fearful awareness they have towards Allah, as well as further increasing their desire for the Garden. A true believer is aware that these hardships are creat
ed for him as a trial and a learning experience, and as opportunities for displaying good conduct, exercising patience and as long as he relies on Allah, as an opportunity for reward in the Hereafter. The Qur\rquote

Generally amongst the populace an understanding of religion based on hearsay is widespread. The majority of people have not familiarized themselves with Allah\rquote 
s own descriptions of Himself and His attributes as they appear in the original source of religion, namely the Qur\rquote an. Yet Allah has introduced Himself to us in the Qur\rquote 
an in the clearest and most authentic manner possible. The knowledge of most people regarding Allah consists of what they have heard from their respective families, relatives and from here or there. As a result of this, people\rquote 
s understanding regarding Allah varies widely.
\par The interesting point about this is that it has never occurred to a great many people that the things they have heard and been taught in their immediate environments could be incomplete or even totally incorrect. Even if it has occurre
d to them, they would be most unlikely to go out of their way to do the research that would be required in order to ascertain the truth. This is a serious mistake which could result in going to the Fire as a consequence of not identifying Allah correctly 
or giving proper recognition to His many great attributes. 
\par This kind of people think of Allah in general terms with respect to His attributes of The Forgiver (Al Ghaffar), The Helper (An Nasr), The Provider (Ar Razzaq), the Subtle One (Al Latif), The Prese
rver (Al Hafiz), The Merciful (Ar Rahim) and The Protector (Al Muhaymin). Limiting their focus to attributes such as these simply results in an unbalanced sense of comfort and complacency, since Allah has other attributes such as The Avenger (Al Muntaqim)
,
 The Punisher (Al Muazzib) and The Subduer (Al Qahhar). However, the people mentioned above would not know what these attributes of Allah actually mean. They cannot think of our Lord in these terms. They do not realize that these attributes will be brough
t to bear upon their actions, their behavior and their conversations. 
\par Even though they may be aware of some of Allah\rquote s attributes by name, they remain unaware of their full import and the manner in which they are going to impinge upon their eternal lives. Either they have a one-sided view of Allah\rquote 
s many attributes, or they imagine that they do not apply to them in any way. 
\par For example, if an injustice has been perpetrated on them, they believe that in the Hereafter Allah, with His infinite justice will seek retribution for this injustice. However, they fail to realize that they too will be faced with Allah\rquote 
s punishment if they do not believe in the Qur\rquote an and act by it as they should. Mankind was created to worship Allah, but if they reject the purpose of 
their creation, they will without doubt face the consequences of this disbelief. The most severe of punishments is required for such an enormous transgression, hence the existence of Hell. Hell, being the most terrible place ever created is the arena for 
punishments whose severity lies far beyond man\rquote s powers of imagination. It subsumes and surpasses many times over the greatest agonies imaginable on Earth. 
\par These people we describe do not have fearful awareness of Allah and behave carelessly; they are heedless of their own consciences and are completely lacking in understanding. They have no proper perception of Allah\rquote 
s strength and His power, His majesty and His vastness, His exaltedness and His greatness. Hence, they fail to experience the kind of inner a
we and deep trepidation appropriate to the prospect of being exposed to His wrath. As a result of this, they do not strive to earn Allah\rquote 
s approval or to implement His commands to the best of their abilities. Neither do they abide by His prohibitions, pref
erring to lead carefree lives. They fail to show the gratitude and appreciation required for the blessings Allah has given them, therefore ungratefulness becomes a permanent feature of their beings. In the end however, the price for living a careless life
 on Earth will be paid with an eternal life of fear and torment.

In order that people might be properly tested, Allah has granted us all a fixed period of time in the temporal world. He sends us warnings and grants us every opportunity to repent and to correct the mistakes we may have made.
 However, for people who do not live by the religion, this very generosity is yet part of what lies behind their inability to fear Allah as they should. In order to avoid the consequences of their actions, people are in general extremely careful when it c
omes to behavior which brings an immediate comeback. Let us look at the following example. 
\par Let us suppose that a person is working for a company on a good salary, and has been given an important set of targets to meet, knowing that failure to achieve these
 targets would be likely to result in the termination of his employment with this company. It requires no great stretch of the imagination to guess how much sheer effort and determination would go into the task. The very thought of the loss he would face 
i
n the event of losing his job would ensure that any lesser approach to it would be entirely out of the question. He would do everything possible, even to the extent of sacrificing his comfort, his sleep and even abandoning other assignments in order to me
e
t his objectives and escape the enormous distress that would result from failure. This is all very well but the question is whether such people feel the same level of urgency with respect to the much greater reality of having to account to Allah? The trut
h is that the vast majority do not because they do not see death and the Hereafter as imminent realities, according to them the life they are leading is much more realistic.

Despite the majority of people knowing that following their death, Allah will call them to account for the lives they h
ave led, and that after this reckoning they will be sent to either the Garden or the Fire, they make no preparation for their life in the Hereafter. Although these people assert their belief in the existence of the Hereafter, the lifestyles they lead are 
hardly any different from those of the outright disbelievers. Furthermore, they display not the least hint of embarrassment about it.
\par The lifestyles of both groups are, to all intents and purposes, identical in appearance, attitudes, behavior, goals and amb
itions. The only difference between them is that the one claims to be Muslim, while the other makes no such claim. In spite of the former group\rquote s willingness to assert their belief in the Qur\rquote 
an, their failure to abide by the judgments of the book they claim to believe in causes them no sense of discomfort or awkwardness whatsoever. 
\par The reason for their apparent state of indifference to the openly contradictory nature of their position is their further assertion that their hearts are pure and that they cause no harm to anyone. 
\par Their attitude is based on the confident belief they will never be sent to the Fire, in other words they view themselves as certain candidates for admission to the Garden. What is also particularly interesting are the criteria they h
ave come up with in order to define the type of person who will enter the Fire, and the corresponding arrogance with which they declare everyone else as fit for the Garden.
\par According to them, the people deserving of the Fire are the criminals and delinquen
ts one generally sees on television or in the papers such as murderers, thieves, terrorists, and assorted deviants who are determined to cause harm to others. Those excluded from this list, the \'93average person,\'94
 who constitute the majority of humanity however, assume all their sins will be immediately forgiven.
\par It is the nature of the criteria they themselves have selected which has given rise to the assumption that they are of the people of the Garden, given that they have not committed murder or stolen an
ything and that they are not terrorists. Thus despite their claims to being Muslims, neither their willingness to commit all forms of transgression, nor their unwillingness to worship, nor their unwillingness to abide by the Qur\rquote 
an and to lead their lives 
safely within the limits established by Allah, arouses within them any sense of fear or nervousness. The simple reason for this is their mistaken assumption that none of these actions or omissions constitute sufficient cause to be sent to the Fire.
\par However, this is a terrible mistake, which may drag them to the pits of the Fire. These ignorant people conjure up values and priorities in the name of Islam, which are very different from those contained in the Qur\rquote 
an. In other words, matters on which Allah plac
es the greatest importance end up, according to their facile reasoning, being considered as marginal. Thus, their self-invented religious perspectives offer them a lifestyle which is completely at odds with a genuine fear of Allah. In the following Qur

those things that the beloved dislikes, but what is interesting is that when we examine the lifestyle of these people none of these signs can be found. A person who sincerely loves Allah will above all else be extremely sensitive towards Allah\rquote

, he will love the things He loves and will be extremely cautious of those things that Allah dislikes. In every detail of his life, he will seek to please Him by demonstrating his deep respect, trust, and submission with absolute devotion. However, someon

he quality of uprightness is only achievable by fearing Allah and adhering absolutely to His commands. For a person to possess and maintain an upright character, a strong lo
ve of Allah is needed together with a profound fear of Allah. With regard to fearing Allah as is due is to Him, this is only made possible by constantly bearing in mind and reflecting on Allah\rquote 
s greatness, glory and grandeur, His high rank, infinite knowledge and power, and His unrestricted and unconditional sovereignty over all His servants, as well as having an absolute belief in Allah\rquote 
s promises, threats, the Day of Judgment and the intensity of its ordeals and the fearful and eternal punishment of Hell. This belief will make way for a strengthened fear of Allah. This fear will also ensure that one\rquote 
s attitude, behavior, movements and conversations, are in accordance and harmony with the moral standards which Allah approves of. A person who fears Allah will be in a constant state of vigilance when it comes to protecting His boundaries. 
\par With regards to people who do not fear Allah, they are able to display any attitude, regardless of Allah\rquote s displeasure. Someone who has forgotten they will be accountable to
 Allah has no need or reason to be honest; to serve others, to be just and honorable, in short, to display good moral conduct. They are motivated exclusively by individual ambition and personal benefit. To consider benefiting others is irrelevant to them.

\par There is nothing people such as this would not do for their own advantage. Because of their inability to acknowledge Allah\rquote s power, the prospect of Allah\rquote 
s punishment does not serve as an incentive to amend their ways. Since they have no fear of Allah or His punishment, they do not adhere to any limits, they ignore Allah\rquote 
s prohibitions, displaying an oppressive attitude towards people, and going to excess in everything negative. Because they do not reflect on Allah\rquote s might and His ability to avenge, they transgress Allah\rquote 
s boundaries without a second thought. 
\par It is for these reasons that those people who do not fear Allah are open to committing every possible sin and moral degradation. They do not adhere to Allah\rquote s religion and through their oppressive beha
vior, they deter other people from religion; they cannot stand to see the implementation of religious standards of morality. Without a doubt, the oppression practiced by these people will be responded to in kind in the Hereafter. Allah informs us in the Q

ebelliousness arises out of an incomprehensible state of spiritual contradiction. He has personally witnessed Allah\rquote s existence. Indeed, he spoke directly with Allah. He had certain knowledge of Allah\rquote 
s attributes, His power and the eternal punishment of Hell.
\par The uncanny similarity between Satan and all those who shun fearful awareness of Allah originates within them. To have clear knowledge of the existence of Allah, and still manage to deny Him and rebel against His authority, represents a truly astoundi

s direct and certain knowledge, one would expect him to have attained the ultimate degree of faith and fear of Allah. By the same token, one would also expect him to have a level of constant awareness to match, giving rise to unparalle

The haughtiness of those people who are completely lacking in fear of Allah is nurtured and cherished to such an extent by them that they imagine that everything is theirs for the taking. For this reason, they are envious of other people\rquote

The brother who did not fear Allah succumbed to the unbridled passions of the self. As a result of the jealousy and anger over the fact that his sacrifice was not accepted, and the sense of rivalry he felt towards his brother, he ended up threatening to k
ill him and subsequently carried out the threat. This case serves as a warning of how dangerous it can be to turn away from fear of Allah, and to abandon oneself to the urges of the lower self. 
\par Someone who does not fear Allah will, when feeling personally 
affronted, not hesitate to cause both physical and spiritual harm to those who have offended him. At the same time jealousy is a fundamental characteristic of Satan. When Satan was expelled from the presence of Allah, he displayed all the hatred and jealo

\par Tho
se without fear of Allah do not even accept the inevitability of death. For these people, the death of a young person close to them, or even the unexpected death of important individuals or people in the public eye, is viewed as shocking and senseless. To
 have to see a previously healthy and able-bodied person become unrecognizable comes as a serious blow to people who would prefer to forget about death.
\par Likewise, for them to see a friend who they may have been with only a couple of days previously, found b
y the side of a road in an unrecognizable state, having been hit by a car, and then having to witness this body being put into a black body bag, zipped up from head to toe, will bring to mind many things they are trying to forget. To see someone of their 
o
wn age, lifestyle and mindset, lying on the road with a crowd gathered around the body, would fill their hearts with the dreaded realization that they are totally unprepared for their own death and the Hereafter. A couple of days before they would have be
en showing off their \'93designer\'94
 clothing together and pursuing their professional ambitions, while claiming not to have any time for religion and cracking jokes about the Hereafter. All of a sudden, confronted with the sight of their erstwhile friend, they 
find themselves in quite a different state of mind. The emergency personnel will gather up for disposal his broken glasses, which were thrown to the ground, his damaged shoes and the fashionable accessories he was wearing. His once proud body will be take
n immediately to a hospital mortuary to prevent decomposition and left there with other bodies. What was once a human being will, within a couple of days, be wrapped in a white cloth and placed into a hole in the ground.
\par However, for most of them this fear 
will be short lived. Within a short period they will revert to their previous mentality, seeing death as something that affects everyone but themselves. Despite seeing people around them dying, in spite of knowing that the Hereafter awaits them, in spite 
o
f the ageing of their own bodies and the step-by-step approach of the end, they do not fear Allah, and so refuse to think about death at all. For this reason, instead of using whatever little time they may have left to alter their ways and conform to Alla
h\rquote s guidance, they choose to pursue an ever-increasing level of heedlessness.

For people who do not believe in or fear Allah the entire world is made up of chaos and coincidences. They think that everything happens by cha

has endless anxieties and fears regarding the future. For example, he could fall sick with an unexpected illness, lose all his wealth, or perhaps an unexpected catastrophe could befall him or his loved ones. Because he imagines all events such as these ha

pen willy-nilly, he never feels free of anxiety and apprehension over the possibility of them happening to him. What is more, the situation is made all the worse by the knowledge that the whole affair is entirely beyond his control, leaving him with an in

\par Only someone who fears Allah will not succumb to these kinds of fear. Fear of Allah and belief in Him displaces all these other fears. To know that Allah is the Owner and Creator of everything, and that no eve

to educate them, but they did not arrive at true obedience to Allah and true belief. When they witnessed Allah\rquote

t their prophets were engaged in difficult struggles with the disbelievers, the hypocrites amongst the Children of Israel were more interested in securing their own advantages and personal gains, and were never really sincere in the fulfilment of their ob
ligations to Allah and His religion. 
\par In a gross display of ingratitude, they abandoned their prophet, Musa (as), leaving him alone at the most critical stage of his struggle, concentrating instead on their own wellbeing and livelihoods. Then, as if this wa

n from a distance, the screaming of someone in agony is enough to cause indescribable distress. This is because mankind has not been created to endure spiritual and physical pain, fear or tension. We cannot withstand for long being enclosed in tight space

\par Despite these obvious realities, people in ge
neral lead a life far removed from fear of Allah due to their state of heedlessness and thoughtlessness. However, the spiritual and physical pains which are experienced on Earth are but a small example of the punishment they will face in Hell and serve on
ly as an example and a warning. These people do not have any regard for Allah\rquote s infinite power and strength, however, when death reaches them, they will sense Allah\rquote 
s greatness with all its violence and severity and be gripped by a fear which is indescribable and incomparable to anything experienced on Earth.
\par Apart from individual punishments, the Qur\rquote an is full of examples of groups of people who have perished under the punishments sent by Allah. These people perished in an instant due to their rebelliousness and non-compliance with Allah\rquote 
s limitations. 
\par Allah has sent whirlwinds against some, which have ripped their homes apart, to others, he has sent a squall, which has levelled their cities to the ground. Concerning earthquakes, so many groups of people h
ave been buried with all their wealth, whilst others have been drowned, and others still have been turned to stone when encased in hot lava. (For further information, please see }{\i\f0\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 Perished Nations}{

 originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsiste

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. S
ince medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interest
ing experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, }{\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than 
all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10}{

\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library cons
isting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes 
can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of rep
ute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\i\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 Scientific American}{\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871  magazine:

So, how could these \'93favorable variations\'94 occur
? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acqu
i
red during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the
 leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 The Origin of Species,}{\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871

However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations.
 Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the struct
ure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the buildin
g which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.}{\i0\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 9}{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an \'93
evolutionary mechanism,\'94 is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an \'93evolutionary mechanism.
\'94 Natural selection, on the other hand, \'93can do nothing by itself,\'94 as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no \'93evolutionary mechanism\'94 in nature. Since no evo

The clearest evidence that the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. 
\par According to this theory, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else over time and all species have come into being in this way. In other words, this transformation proceeds gr
adually over millions of years. 
\par Had this been the case, numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some r
eptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they shou
ld be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as \'93transitional forms.\'94

This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin\rquote s assump

Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye\rquote 
s retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the \'93center of vision.\'94
 These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the \'93center of vision\'94 is never touched by light and may even be 
the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance
, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produce
d
 by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Facto
r
ies, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. 
Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality
 of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears l
ike a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct im
age has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can 
atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situa
tion applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translatin
g them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let 
any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises 
in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate an
d reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on 
t
his endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is 
recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body\rquote 
s technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound acc
ompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

 why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory\rquote s claim regarding the origin of life is inconsiste
nt with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscie
ntific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an \'93attack on science.\'94 Why?
\par The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist exp
lanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is \'93first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist\'94:

It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to
 material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a D
ivine Foot in the door.}{\i0\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871 19}{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid11995351\charrsid4393871

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter crea
ted life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and 
so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as \'93not to allow a Divine Foot in the door.\'94
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All-Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole univer
se from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings.
