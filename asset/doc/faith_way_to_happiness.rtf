ssigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 over the last 140 years it has caused many peopl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are exp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ey can be read at one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or dis\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the read\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 er will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
explanations based on dubious sources, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart.

under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  fascism and communism.

eir contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final Scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (saas), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental te
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
et of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the las

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur'an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urd
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materiali
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundation
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Alla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as al
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sol
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that peopl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During their lives, people have a variety of ta\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rgets and plans they would like to fulfill. Although apparently different at first glance, these targets coincide at a basic level. At the basic level people wish to lead their lives in happiness and tranquility by obtaining as many advantages as they can
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ;\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the happiness and comfort they enjoy being proportionate to the size of the advantages they obtain. In this sense, everyone aims to reach this common goal, following different paths and using different methods, and expending throughout their lives a grea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 deal of effort in pursuit of this purpose. However, achieving everything they want and reaching targets still do not change the end result: a melancholy life filled with unhappiness and the troubles it brings with it... except for the true believers, who
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 seek Allah's approval and are aware that their true abode is in the Hereafter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In present day life a large number of people complain because they have been totally unable to achieve true peace and because despite their efforts and their attempts at happine\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ss, they are not happy at all. The reason why people end up in such a predicament is because they try to find happiness in the wrong places and with the wrong people. For some, happiness is the material wealth they obtain, being able to spend their money 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s they like, buy whatever they want and consume more and more each day. For people like this, consumption, experiencing every beauty and pleasure, is the greatest source of happiness in their lives. Such desires are like a bottomless well\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 they never come \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 efforts only gain them a temporary happiness.

In this verse Allah tells us that false happiness such as this which has been gained in the life of this world with greed and ing\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ratitude, will become endless misery in the Hereafter.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For some, happiness is being known and admired, someone whose favor or company is sought by everyone. Such people want to be admired and imitated in everything they do. They are happy so long as they s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ucceed in this, and manage to ingratiate themselves with others and remain the center of attention.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For others, happiness is escape even for a short time from the troublesome and monotonous life they lead and its problems. In order to be happy, they have t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o make a string of changes to their lives. They have to be unusual, dress differently, lead a "fringe" existence and try everything that is different. Or they have to see and explore different places and get to know new people. People such as these derive
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
great pleasure from being regarded as different and enjoy the attention they attract as a result of this. They believe that by acting in this way they will make their lives more colorful and protect themselves against the unhappiness they feel. To sum up,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 for people of this kind happiness means "change" or "being different." 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the happiness achieved by all these people is false and fleeting. It only exists in the moment and when the moment is over the happiness they feel passes with it and the perso\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Allah has created the life of this world to test people to see whose actions are the best. With His manifold wisdom, Allah grants His mercy to those of His servants He chooses and withdraws it from those He chooses. People should 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
be aware of this truth and know that in either case they should lose none of their attachment and devotion to Allah. For example, Allah tests some people with wealth. When a person who has been poor acquires wealth by some means, this can radically change
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
his psychology and in connection with this his behavior towards others and his ideas about them. The first thing that changes in such people is that they push themselves forward at every opportunity and try to make others around them praise them because t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ey think that due to the wealth they have acquired, they possess a quality which most others do not have. They make the blessings which Allah has given them a matter of superiority and distinction when they compare themselves with other people. Beneath th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s misguided behavior lies the drive of the self to bring about its own desires.  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A person who does not use what he owns to earn the approval of Allah uses it solely to satisfy his own lower self. The lower self wants to be admired and praised all the time\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. People who do not have the aim of pleasing Allah seek only the approval of others and because of this they boast and take pride in everything they acquire or own. People such as this who do not consider the Hereafter have no other course but to use what
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 they have as best they can in the life of this world. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Boasting does not solely arise from the material wealth people possess. A person may make his appearance, his hair, his physique, his success, in short anything which makes him different to those aroun
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d him and better off, a matter for boasting. For instance, when her child earns the right to enter a much sought after faculty of a top class university, this becomes a subject for bragging by the mother. She refers to this subject in every conversation a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d speaks with praise of the difficulties her child suffered and the great support she herself provided. She tries to make use of her child's success and grab a share of it for herself. Of course, she may have supported the child and provided help, but her
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 reason for telling other people about it is usually to earn praise and admiration for herself. She derives great pleasure from this.  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the community of the ignorant, this behavior, which is very widespread, goes by the name of "feeling proud." In this w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ay people try to hide the unpleasantness of what they are doing for the real purpose of attracting praise. They try to present reasonable grounds for their incorrect behavior by sheltering behind phrases such as "I feel proud" or "I'm proud of him." In fa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t, all this behavior is driven by the motive of putting on a show for others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Houses are another subject of boasting widespread amongst the community of the ignorant. A person who buys a new house and furnishes it beautifully invites his friends around bec\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ause he has made his house suitable for display. By showing off the house to others, he creates a situation in which he will receive praise and attract admiration.

One of the most significant reasons for people's unhappiness is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 their ascribing partners to Allah. Some people are not fully aware of the meaning attached to ascribing partners to Allah in the Qur'anic sense. Ascribing partners to Allah means regarding other objects and creatures as having the same godlike qualities 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s Allah, giving them the respect which should be given to Allah and showing towards them the same behavior which should be shown to Allah. This is great disrespect and ingratitude to Allah, Who is the sole deity. Likewise, it is a big mistake to think tha
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the slandering of Allah and disrespect towards Him will go unanswered. Ascribing partners to Allah is the greatest heedlessness and error a person can commit. In the Qur'an, Allah describes it as "a terrible wrong" which will never be forgiven. For this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eason, it is a form of behavior which should be very carefully and strenuously avoided:

Allah does not forgive anything being associated with Him but He forgives whoever He wills for anything other than that. Anyone who associates something with Allah has \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 gone very far astray. (Surat an-Nisa': 116)

One of the returns people who ascribe partners to Allah receive for this behavior in this life is unhappiness. Then, how does ascribing partners to Allah make one unhappy, or what happens if one directs the emoti\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ons and thoughts which should be directed towards Allah towards other beings instead?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The answer is clear. In such a situation thousands of false gods intervene in a person's life. For instance, if a person is fearful of another, he has attributed to that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
other a power and a will independent of Allah. Since under such circumstances he believes that the other person can harm him, he obeys him and in turn tries to gain his approval and goodwill. As can be seen, feeling such emotions towards another individua
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 instead of towards Allah means attributing creative powers to that other individual. This in turn means that the person is making a god equivalent to Allah out of somebody no different from himself. The fact is, however, it is Allah alone Who deserves fe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r and obedience. In a verse of the Qur'an, our Lord advises us as follows:

So, a person should co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Another emotion which is wrongly directed in communities of the ignorant is love. Love is a splendid emotion which Allah has placed in people's hearts but if this emotion\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is not directed correctly it becomes nothing but a source of worry and pain. So much so that, because some people place their ambition for their own benefits above all moral values, they also make love a vehicle for their own advantage. They reach a poin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 where they cannot love if their love is not requited. In such an atmosphere people love one another for the advantages they can obtain but because of this they suffer continual harm. So long as love is shown in an ignorant manner in the wrong places and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o the wrong people, those who show it cannot be protected against disappointment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The One Who deserves love and is to be loved is Allah, Who possesses infinite might. It is Allah Who created people from nothing, Who gives them everything, Who feeds, clothe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s and protects them and gives them a variety of beautiful things. Real love is that which reflects Allah and His manifestations, the love of those who adhere to the path to which they have been summoned by Him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, for a person who ascribes partners t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o Allah, this is impossible. The unconsciousness in which he remains becomes a source of blind love for beings which do not deserve to be loved. The Qur'an tells us about this aspect of disbelievers as follows:

Another way of ascribing partners to Allah is a person's self love, his belief that he is the strongest, the most intelligent and the most handsome. Such a person claims that his own ideas are right and follows them. In short, he sees hi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 mself in a giant mirror. The deity of a person like this is his own self. He adopts himself as his own god. Allah informs us about the condition of such people in the following verse of the Qur'an:

Because people who ascribe partners to Allah adopt other people and beings as their gods they naturally shape their lives according to the wishes of these others because they believe that in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 this way they will be happy and at peace. In addition, it is very important for them to gain the admiration, approval and goodwill of these false gods. Since their happiness is bound up with the goodwill of these false gods they set aside a different par
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of themselves for each of them. They develop a different personality for each of them because they have adopted more than one false god. Just as this causes intolerable difficulties for a person, it also makes him do things he does not want to do. A pers

As Allah tells us in the verse, a person who accepts other gods is compelled to live in psychological turmoil and will be unable to ob\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tain the best result for anything he does or receive the attention and approval he expects. The reason for this is the desire of people to seek their own advantage and put themselves in first place in their relations with one another. People from whom a p

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  towards Allah's approval in the knowledge that there is no power other than His.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Nothing and nobody a person adopts as a false god has any power, beauty, ability or intelligence; it is Allah alone Who possesses all these qualities. Because of this, when t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he person is in trouble and when he wants help, Allah is the only One Who can help him. When he says, "I am thinking," Allah is the One Who inspires his thoughts. When he acts in any way, it is Allah Who really makes him perform the action. When he eats a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tasty meal, it is Allah Who creates the food and the flavor. Again it is Allah Who ensures that the meal is prepared for him. When he falls sick, it is not really the germ which makes him ill but Allah. It is Allah, not the doctor, Who cures him and makes
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
him well. When he sets fire to a piece of paper with a lighter, it is not the flame of the lighter which burns the paper but Allah. When one wears beautiful clothing, it is Allah Who makes one seem beautiful. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is possible to multiply these examples a hu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

rance examination, considered a turning point in the life of every young person. Let us assume that the two people referred to enter this examination. Because these two people differ greatly in their view of fate their psychological approach to the examin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion and its effect on them will also be very different.  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The person who submits to the fate created for him by Allah will not suffer the stress and tension an examination can cause because he knows that the mistakes he makes during it and their outcome a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re known in the sight of Allah before he enters the examination and have been created for him by Allah as a blessing because the examination has already taken place and ended within his fate. This person will simply wait to see the outcome of taking that 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
xamination. He is aware that there is no power other than Allah which can intervene in the result. The knowledge that his result has been created by Allah for his benefit, whether it is a pass or a failure, prevents him from succumbing to examination worr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 es and stress. Because of his devotion and submission to Allah, he accepts any result, good or bad, because the result is what Allah wishes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Because such a person does not become nervous or stressed, he avoids the damage and loss which this might cause him\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. A nervous, stressed person cannot be at ease, cannot collect his wits, cannot use what he knows and can easily make mistakes. It is obvious that being in such a mental state during an important examination will have a negative impact on a person's exami
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ation performance. Because of trust in fate, a person escapes from this negative burden which examination psychology imposes and increases his chance of success in the examination.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When we look at the other person, we see something very different. Because \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this person does not submit to fate and trust in it, he thinks everything he does is under his own control and has developed according to his own plan. The burden imposed by such thinking in an important examination is extremely heavy, and so the person i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 unable to escape from this pressure and is highly nervous and stressed. According to his belief, whether he passes the examination or not is entirely in his own hands. Since he spent months of his time working to pass the examination, the fear that if he
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fails all this effort will have been in vain is another source of worry for him.  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Having no belief in fate may cause stress and tension to have a negative effect on him. He may not be able to gather his thoughts and therefore fail to answer questions he u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nderstands very well or even if he can, he may accidentally select the wrong answer on the answer paper. He may fail an examination which has vital importance to him simply because of stress and tension. So long as a person who falls into this situation d

\par }{\b\f0\fs28\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 They Have Adopted Insincerity as a Principle
\par }{\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To put it briefly, sincerity can be defined as behaving in a determined way according to what a person believes and feels. A person who is sincere in the true s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ense behaves comfortably and naturally in all surroundings because he feels no need to prove himself to others or make them accept him. For a person who lives like this, sincerity becomes a source of comfort and tranquility.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, nowadays many people f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eel a lack of sincerity in their relations with others around them. Many people who live immoral and ignorant lives make a habit of lying, hypocrisy and cheating and base themselves wholly on these "principles." Everybody behaves insincerely towards every
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ody else because everybody is out for what they can get. No doubt, this is not a one-sided situation, it is mutual. One party uses the other and tries as far as possible to take advantage of them. In such an environment no concept of trust remains because
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
there is no telling what anyone will do, how they will behave or what they are thinking. In fact, this insincerity is the reason for people's unhappiness in their relationships with one another, their depressions and the short duration of their love and d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 votion towards one another. Allah warns us that people who depart  from the ways of belief will be unhappy in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"Let them laugh little and weep much, in repayment for what they have earned."}{\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat at-Tawba: 82)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Insincerity causes the development \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of other unpleasant forms of behavior in these people. One of these is behaving with ingratitude for help given them and kindnesses received. Because they live lives far removed from the guidance of the Qur'an, they invariably develop a character trait wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reby they easily forget help and kindnesses but never forget the bad that is done to them. Upon the slightest difference or misunderstanding they immediately go for one another's weak spots and begin criticizing each other as much as possible. They do not
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 see, or do not want to see, one another's good sides. In short, they cannot take as much notice as they should of the kindnesses, the help and the good turns which are done to them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 People who demonstrate such a confrontational attitude also approach Allah\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Another indication of the insincer\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ity of these people is that they put forward a number of reasons and excuses for making their doing just exactly what they want to do seem reasonable. When they are reminded of their responsibility to Allah, they have countless excuses for evading this re
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Someone who knows that Allah surrounds everything, including himself, that He sees \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

From the day man was created to the present, Satan has been the most\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

As we pointed out in the previous section, Satan tr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ies to use every opportunity as best he can to divert people from the way of Allah, to distance them from religion, to have them engage in worthless pursuits and prevent them from thinking about Allah and the Hereafter. One of the situations in which Sata
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  finds an opportunity is the moment when a person sinks into hopelessness or pessimism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 During his life a person \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact nothing a person encounters in life is accidental, empty or meaningles\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s. As Allah tells us in the verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"... And no fruit emerges from its husk, nor does any female get pregnant or give birth, without His knowledge..."}{\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surah Fussilat: 47) Everything that happens takes place with His knowledge, at His wish and under His con\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

When the Prophet Muhammed (saws) and his companions hid in a cave to conceal themselves from disbelievers who were pursuing them, our Prophet's (saws) behavior provided an outstanding example for everybody in this regard. In the Qur'an

In communities which are far from religion, it is very difficult for people to know what is true and what is false because all concepts are in conflict with one another. A person does whatever he regards as logical and correct and in th

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Emotionalism is at the head of the list of these confused concepts. Emotionalism may be defined generally as the evaluation of everything on the basis of one's emotions and the shaping of one's life accordingly. Someone who lives like this needs always to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
be directed by his emotions towards virtue and the truth in order to lead an intelligent, comfortable and tranquil life. However, this is nearly impossible because an emotional person usually has difficulty in evaluating events correctly. This is because 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e acts on the basis of his emotions rather than intelligence and logic. Because he acts with his emotions when making decisions he has difficulty in seeing the true face of events and people. Or, completely to the contrary, in a situation where it is nece
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sary to avoid anger he may be unable to control himself and may easily harm both himself and others. Just as he can suddenly change a minor difference of opinion into a major row, a song he is listening to can make him burst into tears while he appears to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 be cheerfully and happily enjoying himself with friends. In some people emotionalism also manifests itself in such different forms as introversion and irritability.

loss of a person's ability to use his intelligence and the suppression of that intelligence. This is just what Satan, who is determined to pervert people, wants and is waiting for. By using this secret weapon well, Satan prevents people from

using their intelligence and from seeing the truth without their realizing it. He drives people away from Allah's scriptures and their superior morality. It is as though he draws a veil across a person's intelligence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To protect himself from such a situati\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

In previous sections we examined the effects of Satan on people who are distanced from religion and consequently distanced thro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s the degree to which Satan can have a formative effect on people. In the first place, Satan is not a power independent of Allah. Satan is also created by Allah and he is the enemy of humanity only because Allah wills it so. He can have no independent pow

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition to this, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he effect of Satan on people is closely connected with their closeness to Allah and their devotion to Him, in }{\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
short, with the sincerity of their faith. Satan can have no effect on Allah's sincere servants. His effect is only on people who resist Allah and \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ascribe partners to Him. In order to understand this better, we need to know why Allah created Satan. As we are told in the verse, }{\b\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 (Surat an-Nisa': 76), the scheming of Satan over believers is very weak, but the same is not true of those who set their faces against the Qur'an and live in heedlessness of Allah. Allah tells u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s in Surat ash-Shu\hich\f0

to live in happiness and peace as a result. At all times, in all places and under all circumstances they think only of themselves and try to protect their own privileges. There is a point here which must not be misunderstood. Of course, everybody wants to

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason these people are so devoted to their own gain is that they do not adhere to the standards of the Qur'an which Allah sent down as a guid\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The most important factor which pushes these people into behaving in this heedless and unintelligent way is that they regard themselves as a long way from the Hereafter. They think they have plenty of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
life still ahead of them and they do not want to sacrifice their whole lives, their profits and the plans they have made, for something they never think about or whose likelihood they do not regard as very great even if they do think about it. They regard
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
such thinking as a great loss. They regard the life of this world and worldly advantages as a lot closer and a lot easier than what they will gain in the Hereafter. They try to cram all their enjoyment into the life of this world. They pass their entire l

Believers put their trust in Allah in all matters and because they accept everything He creates for them they ne\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

eflected in a negative way in their lives, their actions and their behavior. As they cannot find within themselves the strength and willpower to go anywhere or do anything, they develop a lazy and impotent nature. They avoid making any effort and always s

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can compare the state of these people to that \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we can see, these people live without the spiritual strength which Allah would give them because they\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 have no faith in Him. In return for the immorality which such people display Allah removes the strength from their hearts. As a result, their spiritual state reduces them to a kind of living death. This unpleasant state of theirs is easily discernible in

In contrast to disbelievers, the powerful faith of believers increases their happiness and spiritual strength. Those who always take Allah as their guardian and friend and accept His decree are always cheerful and strong because of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he spiritual strength which Allah gives them in return. They never sink into a lazy or lethargic state, because they know it will bring them harm and loss. The spiritual strength they feel inspires them to strive even harder for Allah's approval, making e

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In difficult situations they encounter on the path of Allah, this spiritual strength is also the source of their patience. Therefore, there is no challenge or circumstance which could ever cause them to behave in a way which Al

lah would not approve. They always opt to be vigorous and active in order to be always at the forefront, setting the best example. Their efforts ensure that they come a little closer to the prospect of the Garden each day. The strength brought by their ho
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e of Allah's approval grows all the time so that they achieve the superior mode of conduct which Allah describes in the Qur'an.  
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The satisfaction they derive from doing good deeds creates in them a desire to look for further good actions to do. No matter \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Zeal is the intense desire to accomplish a task or reach a goal. The zeal people feel towards any task is in proportion to their sincer\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

There are great differences in every area b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

ior. People who have removed themselves from the guidance of the Qur'an reflect the resignation they feel towards their troubles with a weary and hopeless expression on their faces. Even at times when there is nothing to sadden or trouble their hearts, th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s troubled expression remains fixed. They complain about everything that happens to them and can never be easily satisfied with anything. They usually exhibit irritable and contrary behavior. Needless to say, it is out of the question for a person in such

In order to know Allah Who created all living creatures and the universe and to compr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, for a person to be able to see and understand all these things\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 (Surah Qaf: 8) A person can look at the proofs of the creation on the face of the earth as much as he wants to, he can investigate these for days, weeks or years and by doing so he can discover that they have astonishing characteristics but so long

Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was ad\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
vanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's}{\i\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid2781262

es on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Mo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these diff\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
iculties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Earth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2) No scientific finding shows that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all.

The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell coul\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 this "first cell" originate?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non-living materials came together to form living organisms,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed tha

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by fl

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a gr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eat impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eveloped laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 10}{\f0\up4\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 50}{\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is considered to be impossible in practical terms.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The DNA molecule, whic\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 5
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 0\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 0 pages each.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nswer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their l
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high tre
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid2781262 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time.8
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural sel

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism adde\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in addition to natural mutation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Today, the model that stands for evolution in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 an only harm it. The American geneticist B. G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any ra\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ndom change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all prob

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself," as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutionary mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called "ev

The clearest evidence that the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 According to this theory, every living species has spru\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else over time and all species have come into being in this way. In other words, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Had this been the case, numerous int\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
here should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refe

However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the nineteenth century all over th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, this is very strong evidence that all living things are 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor is that it was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma:

Creation and e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Besides all the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by child\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ren:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bri

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal

as they like. Let them \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels f

r billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ructure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, phea

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example.

Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays comi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 mage after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of visio\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ig difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The backgro
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
echanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that prod
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ot have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear send
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you list
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of ef\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of en
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ustry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's cl\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an "attack on science." Why?

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0
