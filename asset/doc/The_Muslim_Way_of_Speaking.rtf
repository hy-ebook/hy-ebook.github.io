rimary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-know

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Mu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to com
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 letely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in man\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Mala
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ted, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hese works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other boo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ks that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
phasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Q\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a do
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late.

A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 over the last 140 years it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. 
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are ex\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
plained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the reader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ey can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and rea\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ding of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to read these books.
\par

 many years have we possessed a faculty as important as speech. How many years have you been able easily to say a word without effort, or to form any sentence you wanted to? Without a doubt, you will answer, "It has been many years." However, it probably 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ill not have occurred to most people to ask themselves such a question, because speech is a faculty most of us are born with, and therefore, often merely taken for granted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Most are able to speak as much or as little as they want, thanks to this God-given \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ability, and, it would seem, in general, people have become so accustomed to it that they fail to take into account the importance of speech.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Rather, it is of an importance that everyone should recognize; that is, that being able to speak is a blessing, an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d that Allah granted such an ability for a specific purpose. On the Day of Judgment everyone will be held responsible for every word they have uttered.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Allah created humanity to serve Him. He gifted human beings with intelligence in order that they might g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rasp and believe in His greatness; as also eyes for them to see and appreciate the sublimity of that which He created; ears that they would listen to His verses being recited, and tongues for them to exalt His glory and communicate His message. As stated 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n the following verse of the Qur'an, }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"No indeed! We will write down what he says and prolong the punishment for him. We will inherit from him the things he is talking about and he will come to Us all alone,"}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surah Maryam: 79-80) every word a person utters\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 is kept in a record in Allah's sight. Therefore, just as all are responsible for that which they choose to believe, and for every act they do, so, too, will they be held responsible for every word they speak, and receive their due recompense on the Day o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Judgment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
However, most never venture to consider that they will be called to account for everything they have done on the Day of Judgment: for every word, and every phrase they uttered. As a result, they are careless in their speech, speaking without thi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nking and without recognizing the responsibility under which they have been placed. Nevertheless, Allah's promise, as He has related in the Qur'an, will definitely be kept; and, while people may indeed have forgotten much of what they once said, their wor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s will be brought before them on the Day of Judgment. With this verse of the Qur'an: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"Standing over you are guardians, noble, recording, who know what you do,"}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat al-Infitar: 10-12) Allah points out that the angel scribes write every word that spills f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rom a person's mouth. In another verse, Allah advises us that, just as He has given everything the ability to speak for itself, on the Day of Judgment, He will give people's skins the ability to speak and permit them to bear witness to what they had done:

Thus, no matter the extent to which some people would want to conceal what they were responsible for saying, or how much they hope to avoid confessing to them, their ploy will not be of any use. Though they do not want to give account of what they had don
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l be unable to account for, and only fill us with remorse.

with a clear conscience (Surat al-Haqqa: 19). That is be\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cause believers are those who, being always mindful of Allah, live as Muslims in this world, and therefore, also speak as Muslims.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "The Muslim way of speaking" is speaking in all instances with the use of one's conscience, in the knowledge that Allah is pr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Muslim way of speaking is possible only by submitting oneself to Allah and the message of the Qur'an. After fully experienc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ing faith in one's heart, as well as sincerity and a sense of submission, one will come to recognize that it is Allah Who grants speech. Allah will inspire a person to speak in the way of the Muslims, and lead him or her to speak in the sincerest, most wi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this book, we will seek to encourage all to use the power of their speech in such a way as to be pleasing to Allah, by exploring the i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

With regard to people in general, one of the most important issues in life is speech. Through it they express their views, their beliefs, their ideas and thoughts. Ultimately, much of that which they feel in their hearts, the thoughts they aim to hide, th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ir desires, their ideals or fears, are also reflected in their speech. Therefore, whether or not someone's spiritual state is sound, or whatever level of intelligence or conscientiousness they possess, it will make itself evident through the words they us
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . From their language may be understood whether they are honest, sincere, and trustworthy, or dishonest, ill-willed and potentially a liar.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is a well-recognized truth that one of the defining characteristics of a person is his or her way of speaking. Wh\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
en someone is being judged, for whatever matter, generally, it is what they say which is most often taken into account to determine their level of innocence or culpability. The job interview is a good example of this. Because employers often do not find t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e written material provided by the applicant sufficient, they opt to talk to them people face to face, to obtain information on them about various subjects in person. Such discussions help the employer form a better impression of the applicants' true char
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cter and personality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The Qur'an, the Book that provides us with the most apt information on all matters, informs us that speech is one of the most important characteristics to bring to light a person's character. In a verse, Allah informs us that one's ma
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nner of speaking is an important factor in discerning those who are insincere: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"If We wished, We would show them to you and you would know them by their mark and know them by their ambivalent speech. Allah knows your actions."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surah Muhammad: 30)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Just as \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the manner of their speech reveals mean-spirited, ill-intentioned or hypocritical people for who they are, so, too, does the rule apply in reverse for people of faith, morality and who are good at heart. Consequently, a person who has sincere faith in his
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
heart speaks in a way that is particular to the faithful, that is, in the way of the Muslims. The Muslim way of speaking is one of the most telling attributes of believers that evinces their love of Allah, their attachment to Him, and their respect and aw
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 reness of Him. Because of this difference, manner of speech is one of the primary characteristics that demark the faithful from unbelievers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As recompense for their sincere belief, Allah assists believers to speak in the noblest, most appropriate and sensi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ble manner. A believer, through knowledge of this truth, is more easily submissive to and trusting of Allah. People who do not live fully by faith are more concerned of the evil they hide in their hearts being revealed through their speech. But, no matter
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
what care they take, they cannot prevent their speech from exposing them for who they really are. The Muslim way of speaking is a trait acquired not from a technical study of language or of especial attention to one's word use, but from sincere faith. Thi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  is a law of Allah, and an ability granted by Him to believers.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important aspect of the Muslim way of speaking is the following; Allah has imposed on believers the duty of communicating to others His religion and the moral values which it prescribe\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s. When believers, who live by the values of religion, and who are cognizant of Allah's greatness, sincerely relate their feelings and thoughts to those who are ignorant of religion, and who lead a life far removed from it, this may help many to turn to I
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lam and their hearts to be filled with awareness of Allah. It is also an important act of worship for believers. Because of this, true believers always ask of Allah the ability to speak intelligently, wisely and appropriately. When they talk with others, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hey make reference to Allah through the best of words, and tell them about the morality expounded in Islam, enjoining what is the right and forbidding what is wrong. Hence, for believers, speech becomes a form of worship, which can earn them reward throug
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 out their lives.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we are told by the following verse, }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"Who speaks anything better than the one who summons to Allah, acts righteously, and says, 'I am among those who submit to Allah'?"}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surah Fussilat: 33), those who speak most nobly are those who call \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
on others to obey the morality prescribed in the Qur'an, in other words, those who speak in the way of the Muslims. By employing this manner of speaking, believers hope to earn the pleasure of Allah, His mercy and Paradise. For this reason, all believers 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hose sincerely turn to our Lord must fulfill all that is required in speaking in the way of the Muslims, and show determination in that endeavor until the end of their days.

 by them, or on some success which they might have achieved. However, those of pure faith know that all are under Allah's control, and they thus behave accordingly. With regards to this matter we may offer the following example:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A businessman who has inves\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ted all his money in a new venture enters into various advertising and promotional campaigns to secure a good market share for his products. In order to compete with other firms in the same sector, he needs to produce better quality products. In addition,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he expects good performances from all those who work for the company, from the advertising executive to the marketing or sales personnel. He gives these employees the necessary instructions. He makes speeches to encourage them or to inspire them because i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  is clearly necessary for him to stay ahead of other companies and to achieve greater success than they have.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now let us consider the difference between this person and someone else, in a similar situation, but who knows there is no god but Allah. That per\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
son follows all the appropriate practical steps. However, he is aware that the authority to make him rich lies not with the advertising, promotion or marketing campaigns, nor in expert personnel. On the contrary, he knows that they are human beings, who c
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n only make decisions through the will of Allah, and achieve success only with Allah's permission. He knows that if he were to regard any of these as possessing a power independent of Allah, that would be to deify others besides Allah. For this reason, wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n communicating his demands, managing his employees, and monitoring all operations, he speaks with the knowledge that all such factors are at Allah's disposition. When something occurs which appears to him to be a setback, at no time does he plunge into d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pression, nor does he lash out angrily. No matter who was responsible for the problem, or for what reason, he takes the wisest decisions and adopts the most appropriate measures. However, at no time does he employ a manner of speaking that reflects the de
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fication of others beside Allah, by regarding the person who caused the error as an independent power, or believing that events transpired by and of themselves. That is because, he knows that, if a mistake was made, it was made because it was in that pers
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n's fate and that Allah had willed it. The whole scenario is a part of his trial in the life of the world; of whether he will fall into the error of believing that events arise out of the disposition of others, or that he will act in the knowledge that th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
re is no god but Allah. In this situation which we have described, one who is of committed faith knows that everything is part of the destiny decreed by Allah, according to His divine wisdom. For this reason, when a person comes up against an unexpected o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tcome, they remain calm, and speak in a way that is grateful to Allah, thus exemplifying humility towards Him and submission to Him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such knowledge, when reflected in speech, is an important manifestation of faith. One who knows that there is no god but Al\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lah, and in whom that knowledge is reflected in his speech, habitually brings attention to Allah's greatness and glory to those around him, or, otherwise, brings these things to their attention.

Allah has determined a specific destiny for every living thing. Everything people experience during their lives, or every task they undertake, or every word they utter, was predetermined by Allah before they were even b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
orn. Moreover, because Allah transcends time, the life of all things is lived out and concluded in His sight. However, a person who is bound by time can only experience life within it (in the order of a calendar). Just as one who is 40 today has lived 40 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ears\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 assuming the human lifespan is 80 years\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
his remaining 40 years have been encompassed in the sight of Allah. However, a human can only witness and experience these developments through time, or within the 40-year period ahead of him.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, what we \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
describe as the future, or the sequence of events which are yet to happen, has already begun and ended within Allah's eternal knowledge. All that has already happened in Allah's sight constitutes a person's destiny. Everyone is accorded a fate from which 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hey will not be able to escape. Just as one cannot change one's past, neither can one change one's future, because both have already been experienced, seen and perceived in the sight of Allah. However, some, because they do not have any such foreknowledge
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 believe their futures are in their own hands. Therefore, not believing in destiny they fall into the error of presuming that they can shape it. However, a person's whole life is like a film which has already been shot. As if being made to see what happen
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 when watching the film, a person is in no position to change the film's script or intervene; so, in a similar way, is it impossible for that person to interfere in the events that play out according to his destiny. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the Qur'an, we are told that Allah h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as pre-ordained a specific destiny for each and every individual, and that all will never experience that which has not already been prescribed:

\par }{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As these verses explain, a specific destiny has been created, not only for each human being, but for all inanimate and living things, that is, all things. From the wooden table in 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
your house to the shoes on your feet; from the rose seedling in your garden to the clothes in your wardrobe; from your friends to your cat, everything in existence is subject to a destiny determined by Allah. It is already foreordained what phases yoursel
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 and the things that belong to you, such as the table, the rose seedling, and your friends, will experience in the future. For example, it had already been known, far into eternity in Allah's sight, who would plant the seed of the tree from which the tabl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 was made, for how long and under what conditions the tree would grow, when, how and by whom it would be cut down, to which sawmill it would be taken, in what dimensions it would be cut, what quality and shape of table would be made of it, how you would d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cide to buy the table, where you would find it, when you will put it in your house, in which part of your house you would put it, and what meals you will eat, who you would talk to and what letters you would write at it, because Allah determined all such 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hings before you were born, and knew, as in a single transcendent moment, how to bring them about. To you, however, you would learn of them only as they occurred, in sequence through time.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a person is not informed of the reality of destiny, or has not f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ully understood its reality, he may act without considering that he is fulfilling the destiny prescribed for him, and be led astray by the sequence of events he experiences. For example, when he goes out to buy a dining table for his house, he looks throu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h dozens of shops, changes his mind time after time in each case, thinks carefully, exchanges ideas and discusses his options with those with him. In the end, he believes he has taken a decision of his own deliberation. In fact, however, before he had set
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
out to buy the table, the one he was ultimately to choose was already written in his destiny; therefore, he merely searched for, found and purchased that table which was already prescribed for him according to his destiny. The exchange of ideas, the discu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sions and his difficulty in reaching a decision, were all likewise determined according to a destiny prescribed by Allah.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Hence, for a person to feel pain, regret, sorrow or fear in response to a particular event, and to waste words such as "If only I had \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
done such and such," or "If only I hadn't gone here or there," or to worry about the future is pointless in the extreme, because the person is fulfilling a life which has already begun and ended, and the events over which she feels regret or sorrow are pa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t of that destiny. For example, when a person carries too many plates in her hands and drops and smashes them, she may feel regret, saying, "If only I hadn't tried to carry so many, then it wouldn't have happened." But the truth which she does not know, o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 has forgotten, is that it was determined, for that very moment, where and how every one of those plates would be broken. Indeed, it was fated who would break them, even before they were manufactured or before the person who would break those plates was b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rn. A person should simply try to consider all the events which take place and take a lesson, that she may understand the wisdom behind them. However, feeling sorrowful over such things is futile, because she has no power to prevent what happens to her. W

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dom in these events Allah has brought about and is grateful. If they cannot at first understand them, they put their faith in Allah and pray for Allah to reveal their purposes and their wisdom. If still they cannot recognize them, those who know that they
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 will be brought forth on the Day of Judgment live in the tranquility and comfort of believing with certainty that Allah is the lord of eternal justice, and is compassionate and merciful.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such people's submission and devotion can be clearly discerned in the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ir speech. In no instance do they use words such as, "Why did that happen?" with reference to events. They speak in the knowledge that Allah has created everything in the best form, and that some happening which might at first appear negative will in the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd bring some blessing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the Qur'an, Allah reminds us of this truth with the following verse: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"It may be that you hate something when it is good for you and it may be that you love something when it is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Sura\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t al-Baqara: 216) Therefore, when confronted by an experience which appears as a setback, sincere Muslims' words ought to be, "My Lord brings about everything for a purpose, there must certainly be a good in this too," or "Allah ordained this to happen fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  our benefit." They never complain, as would the ignorant, such as, "Oh dear, what a pity, how could I do such a thing?" grumbling in a way which suggests a lack of submission and hope in Allah.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This manner of speaking, in the knowledge that everything and\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 everyone was created for a specific good, is important for Muslims throughout their lives. They exclude nothing, no-one and no event from this understanding. They know that, when they face a setback, it is a reflection of ignorance to speak in a manner i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 opposition to their fate, and instead consider that occurrence to be a positive aspect of his fate. No matter whether they, or some else, committed a mistake, they would not say such things as "why did you do it," "this wouldn't have happened if you hadn
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 '\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t gone there." Rather, they speak as people who have grasped the truth in the verse: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "\'85\loch\f0 \hich\f0 
 What assailed you on the day the two armies met was by Allah's permission\'85\loch\f0 "}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surah Al \hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 
Imran: 166) They also know that unwanted outcomes through the lack of proper adva\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nce precaution is also part of their fate. Like someone watching a film many times over, seeing the same thing scene after scene. For that reason, immersing oneself in sorrow or regret, and forming illogical excuses, such as, "if this had happened, such e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
se would have happened" is pointless. Whatever happened was for the best. Thus, in the Muslim way of speech, never is there any anger, rage, tension, complaint, disappointment, panic, fear or worry. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even through events that are the most difficult and trou\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
blesome, believers try to discover their hidden good as well as the possible outcomes that would provide blessings, and speaks of these with sincerity. Those who behave as Muslims help to dispel panic and worry by influencing positively those around them.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the Qur'an, Allah indicates to the faithful the manner of speaking which is required in times of difficulty, in this verse : }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"Say: 'Nothing can happen to us except what Allah has ordained for us. He is Our Master. It is in Allah that the believers shoul\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d put their trust."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surat at-Tawba: 51) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In another verse, our attention is drawn to the humble speech of the faithful, that is, those who know that fate or everything that occurs has been ordained ultimately for their benefit: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "Those who, when disaster s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 trikes them, say, 'We belong to Allah and to Him we will return' "}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surat al-Baqara: 156). The reward which Allah will give to those who understand this truth is described in this verse: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"Those are the people who will have blessings and mercy from their Lo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rd; they are the ones who are guided."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat al-Baqara: 157) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The manner of speaking of a believer, when saying, with reference to fate, that there is good in everything is very different from the "consoling," "calming" or "parroted" speech of one who is \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
far from the morality expounded in the Qur'an. When confronted with similar events, some of those who have not adopted the morality set forth in the Qur'an may also use expressions as "every cloud has a silver lining." However, there is a certain differen
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e in the way they employ it. Muslims say this from the heart, sincerely, from deep in their soul and with definitiveness. No matter how many times those with a corrupt morality may pass this phrase to their lips, the fact that they cannot express it as a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 eartfelt belief is revealed by the lack of trust in Allah reflected in their behavior.

s the heart and conscience of the listener directly. It is in a human beings' nature to be prone to the effects of sincerity. Sincere speech aids people to see the truth of an idea which they had till then not believed in, which they would not have tolera
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed, and which, therefore, they would have opposed and refused to evaluate objectively. It encourages the listener to also think sincerely, as well as to judge and speak sincerely. Compared to one who speaks sincerely, the insincerity of one who makes flow
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ry speeches with much affectation is immediately recognizable. Indeed, often, people see that speaking insincerely only works against the person.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the more important characteristics of those who speak sincerely is that they take refuge in Allah, with\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 no attempt to elaborate their speech in some peculiar way. Sincere speech reflects the honest feelings of a person. If there is a defect or some corruption in that person, then admitting to it honestly is also a sign of sincere speech. Those who speak si
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cerely present themselves as they are; they do not attempt to present themselves as good if they are bad, or if they are good to conceal the fact, or to give a different impression of what they are to those around them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even if they have not been introduce\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Speaking sincerely is a great comfort, both to the speakers, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and to the listeners; the speakers experience the peace of saying what comes from their heart, without worry, because they are devoted to Allah, while the listeners experience the confidence of trusting sincere, well-intentioned and honest people, and act

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Lying is frequent where the morality of the Qur'an is not followed. Some believe that lying is not harmful. Some say that, while certain lies are wrong, others \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
are permissible. They consider that small lies, in order to avoid suffering some greater loss, whether in the moral or material sense, are a necessity of life. They try to ease their consciences by putting forward suggestions such as, "I tell lies but I d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nobody any harm," or "By lying I'm actually doing good." By reason of these excuses, they tell dozens of lies throughout the day, though they claim that they are not lies. For example, they may tell someone who calls them on the phone, "I'm very busy. I 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an't talk to you at the moment," while, in fact, at the time they weren't busy doing anything at all. Or, they lose a file at the office but, when asked, say they know nothing about it, or try to put the blame on someone else. When they meet their bosses,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
though they think exactly the opposite, they say things like, "You think very correctly," or "You conducted business very well," being truly two-faced. They tell a friend who asks for a loan, "I'm in trouble at the moment, I have no money myself," when in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
truth they have quite enough. When one of their relatives asks for help, they find an excuse saying, "I'm very ill, I can't come at the moment," when in actuality they are not ill at all. It is possible to offer a great number of such examples, because pe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ple who have descended into this sort of morality have practically made lying a way of life. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As for Muslims, they speak in the knowledge that Allah sees them, in all instances and all times, and hears every word they say, and that they will be called upon\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 to account for themselves on the Day of Judgment. Because they fear Allah, they avoid telling lies, or using even the slightest evasion, as well as concealing information, and slander, gossip and bad language of all types. They take refuge in Allah from 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In those communities in which they carried out their missions, the Prophets were known for their true word, as can be understood from the ways in which \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
they were addressed by the people around them. The Qur'an tells us of one who had been unjustly thrown into prison, because of a false accusation, and who had come to the Prophet Yusuf (as) saying: }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 \hich\f0 "O truthful Yusuf \'85\loch\f0 "}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surah Yusuf: 46) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The true words of \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Muslims are noticeable in a number of ways; they never perjure themselves. Allah warns believers to avoid such transgressions in the following verse of the Qur'an: }{
\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "They have made their oaths into a cloak and barred the Way of Allah. What they have done is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  truly evil."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surat al-Munafiqun: 2) In fact, false oaths are one of the most frequently used methods to deceive one another by those who are removed from the morality expounded in the Qur'an. Even when they clearly know that each other has no fear of All
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ah, and that their oaths are used as a means of deception, they still believe each other's words. This behavior, however, is strongly condemned by our Prophet (saas), who said, }{\i\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 "Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah's Covenant and their oath\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter." (Bukhari and Muslim)}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In other verses, also pertaining to speaking the truth, Allah points out that making a promise one cannot keep is unacceptable; }{\b\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"You who believe! Why do you say what you do not do? It is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  deeply abhorrent to Allah that you should say what you do not do."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  (Surat as-Saff: 2-3) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For that reason, the faithful do not make promises they cannot keep. They \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
know these may burden them with great responsibility in the presence of Allah. Among those distant from the morality of the Qur'an, however, these acts are quite common. This sort of people may resort to such ploys to gain an unfair advantage, to lead tho
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e around them in the direction they wish, or to cover up their own shortcomings. As for the faithful, when they give their word they do not break it. They know that if they do not keep their word they will have committed an error, not only against others,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 but against Allah. Because they fear Allah, they try to remain true to their word, no matter how difficult it may be to do so. Our attention is drawn to this feature of believers in the Qur'an:

 thinking, or they can make the effort to speak in the finest way. Of the two approaches, the one which would be expected to be acceptable in Allah's sight, and which will earn the approval of Allah, is the second; that is, to do one's utmost and speak in
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the most conscientious manner.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can explain this with an example. One may turn a blind eye to the superior behavior of another, and not mention it, or he may admit that it was indeed excellent behavior, but reluctantly and half-heartedly. Or, he may do e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
xactly the opposite and tell the person just how superior was his morality and how exemplary was his behavior, sincerely and from the heart. At first glance, the difference between these two manners may not mean much. However, upon closer inspection, with

the regards to the rewards they garner in Allah's sight, there is a great difference. Therefore, in order to speak in the way of the Muslims, Muslims should highlight the good qualities of the other, without in any way giving in to their pride and allowin
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 themselves to be taken over by envy. Trying to ignore the matter, even in part, and growing arrogant, is behavior which reflects the type morality of those who are far removed from the lessons of the Qur'an. The faithful are those who notice such devianc

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before uttering a word, Muslims consult their conscience and try to say only what is best. They take care not to say a single word which w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ill discomfort the other person, or cause doubt or concern in their heart. On the contrary, they will try to speak in such a way as to put their heart at ease, to console, and thus enthuse them. They speak for the purpose of encouraging others, and ensuri

Another way of speaking which Muslims must avoid is that peculiar to hypocrites, which is full of doubt and causes doubt. Because hypocrites are in serious doubt about the existence of Allah, about the afterlife and about Allah's promises, their speech re
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lects these doubts and insecurities. They are never able to explain the morality of the Qur'an as openly, clearly and definitely as the faithful can. This deep-seated doubt, which reflects itself in their speech, aims also to cast doubt in the hearts of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ose who listen to them. However, the faithful, who believe sincerely and with certainty, are not affected by their speech, because they are convinced that the Word of Allah is true. If there is one who speaks in a way to reflect these doubts, they know it
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is the result of the person's insincerity and corrupted way of thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Such errors are never found in the speech of Muslims; because there is no doubt in their hearts, their words are definite and unambiguous. Nevertheless, they take care not to speak in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a way such as to give rise to any misunderstandings among their listeners, because sometimes, even with the best of intentions, several sentences set together or two subjects mentioned successively may be open to different interpretations.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Even if it is n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
what types of connotations may arise, and the context of the situation. A contrary approach would reflect a disposition peculiar to the "secretly doubting character" of hypocrites. For this reason, taking great care to not make speeches that are particula

he Muslim way of speaking is a significant characteristic of faith, and is the most influential way of speaking on the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
face of this earth. The power of its influence springs from the faith and sincerity of the believers. Muslims reflect to one another the way they live with their words; they reveal what they really believe and feel in their speech. Generally, those who sp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ak in the way of the Muslims impress those they meet. Because, for much of their lives, they have been exposed only to conversations which do not reflect the morality of the Qur'an, the sincerity of Muslims offers a stark contrast and therefore profoundly
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
affects them. Though some they had formerly met with and spoken to may have explained to them the need for moral perfection and sincere religious devotion, perhaps these people's failure to practice what they preached prevented what they said from having 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  sincere effect on the listener. Because these cases are so widespread, when meeting those who are sincere, that is, who practice what they preach, they listen to what they have to say\hich\f0 
\emdash \loch\f0 Allah willing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 with great interest and sincerity, that which they had p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eviously heard, but had often dismissed , and put what they hear into practice. This is one of the most important effects that the Muslim way of speaking can have; being able to reform the hearts of people, through Allah's will, and make them love the fai

One who speaks in the way of the Muslims is able to explain the morality of the Qur'an to others in the best and most effective way. For example, when they are explaining the meaning of awareness of Allah, this awareness of Allah is also reflected in th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eir speech, and with Allah's permission, thus allows those they are speaking with to understand this subject more easily. If the speaker tries to explain the same subject without this awareness in his or her heart, repeating the same sentences, in the sam
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 way, with the same arguments, even if he were to do so over and over, because he was not able to convince them of his sincerity, the listeners will likely be unmoved by what they were told. However, one who speaks in the way of the Muslims will explain s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ncerity by being sincere, submission by feeling submission, optimism with optimism, and compassion with compassion, etc, Allah willing, will exercise an effect on the conscience of the listener.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important effect that the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Muslim way of speaking has is that it puts people's hearts at peace, contentment and ease, because, as Allah tells us, }{

 (Surat ar-Ra\hich\f0 \lquote \loch\f0 d: 28). Every word spoken mindful of Allah and in conformity \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
with His will, brings peace and joy to people's hearts. Those who speak in this way may not directly refer to Allah by name, or be speaking on a religious subject, but just their manner of speech, which reflects their faith and the morality of the Qur'an,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
effectively reminds people of Allah. Muslims affect people around them; because of their way of speaking, others begin to think about the temporary nature of this worldly life, the nearness of death, the truth of the afterlife, and the importance of earni
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g Allah's approval. Thus, one of the effects on those who benefit from witnessing the Muslim way of speaking is that it leads them towards examining their consciences and thinking sincerely.

\par }{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As these verses explain, the faithful ought to make Allah, His Messenger, and those who believe, their friends. When they meet other believers, w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ho speak in the way of the Muslims, their words being a reflection of their sincere faith, they develop trust and a deep bond among themselves. This is Allah forging their hearts into agreement. The foundations of this friendship are so sound that we are 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 old in the Qur'an that this closeness cannot be acquired in any other way: }{\b\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
"And [He] unified their hearts. Even if you had spent everything on the earth, you could not have unified their hearts. But Allah has unified them. He is Almighty, All-Wise."}{\f0\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 (Surat al-Anfal: 63) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Another effect caused by the Muslim way of speaking is an increase in hope and enthusiasm. Those who speak in accordance with the morality of the Qur'an, throughout their lives, consistently inspire others to what is good, and in con
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
formity with the Qur'an. Because they remind one another that trust in Allah is a source of hope for the faithful, even in their most difficult moments, that fate unfolds in the best possible way, and of other such matters, naturally, they strengthen one 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nother's morales.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Moreover, the effect of this faith-boosting manner of speaking also takes place in hypocrites and unbelievers as much as on Muslims. The Muslim way of speaking, at all times and in all places, of those who are devoted to Allah with profou
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd faith and sincerity, causes serious discomfort in hypocrites. Like idolaters and unbelievers, hypocrites feel ill at ease in the presence of those who speak in the way of the Muslims.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the same way, Satan cannot be assuaged where people speak in the M\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uslim way, because, in such instances, hypocrites cannot foment their havoc and Satan cannot pursue his Satanic aims. Every word of the hypocrite, and every whisper of Satan, loses its effect through the Muslim way of speaking. For this reason, where peop
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e speak in the way of the Muslims, one with the character of a hypocrite either reforms his ways by deriving lessons from their speech, or reaches a point where he cannot stand it any longer, and removes himself from the presence of the faithful. In this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ay, the Muslims purge themselves of hypocrites who otherwise try to find a place amongst them by concealing their true faces.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In short, the Muslim way of speaking is a continual source of blessing and abundance for those around them; it is a form of worshi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
p which is, not only important from with regards to the afterlives of the faithful, but is at the same time directed towards everyone. As a matter of fact, in the Qur'an Allah explains that the best of words are a permanent source of blessing for people:

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

serted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from g

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory," or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortion\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. }{\b\f0\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid9900742\charrsid6190065

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, o

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a seri
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touch\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been ab\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
le to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most develo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
chieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blur
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism produci\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ng this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been fo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rmed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity syste
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ms, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear.

 the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and
