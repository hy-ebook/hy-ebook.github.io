 anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, during the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a decep
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ion is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the religion. It is imperative that this important service be rendered to everyone. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spa
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e a chapter for a summary of this subject. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 In all the books by the author, faith-related issues are explained in the light of Qur'anic verses, and people are invited to learn Allah\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s words and to live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah
\hich\f0 \rquote \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 s verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s mind. The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This ef\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ective and lucid narrative makes it possible to read them in a single sitting. Even those who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 This book and all the o\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ther works by Harun Yahya can be read individually or discussed in a group. Those readers who are willing to profit from the books will find discussion very useful in that they will be able to relate their own reflections and experiences to one another. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 I\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
n addition, it is a great service to the religion to contribute to the presentation and circulation of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the books of the author are extremely convincing, so, for those who want to co
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 municate the religion to other people, one of the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 It is hoped that the reader will take time to look through the review of other books on the final pages of the book, and appreciate the rich \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
source of material on faith-related issues, which are very useful and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 In them, one will not find, as in some other books, the personal views of the author, explanations based on dubious sources, styles unobservant of the respect and re\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
verence due to sacred subjects, or hopeless, doubt-creating, and pessimistic accounts that create deviations in the heart.

\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 9\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
80s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark 
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 iaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies such as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s seal on the cove
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 r of the books is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (saas), the last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur
\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an and sunnah, the author makes it his purpose to dispr\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ve each one of the fundamental tenets of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the final Prophet (saas), who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used a
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 All author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s works center around one goal: to convey the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s message to people, encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues (such as the existence of Allah, His unity and the Hereafter),\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  and to expose the feeble foundations and perverted ideologies of godless systems. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian, and they are enjoyed by readers worldwide. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these work\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
s have been instrumental in many people recovering their faith in Allah and in many others gaining a deeper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style gives these books a distinct touch which directly effects any on
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
 who reads or studies them. Immune to objections, these works are characterized by their features of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give serious thought to them can any longer s
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ncerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism or any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence since these books refuted such ideologies from their very foundations. All conte
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 porary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an. The author modestly intends to serve as a means i\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 n humanity\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s search for Allah\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to pr\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 opagate other books which create confusion in peoples\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
 minds, lead man into ideological chaos, and which, clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is apparent that \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 i
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 t is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s books is to ove\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 r
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 come disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an. The success and impact of this service are manifest in readers\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0  conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and all the ordeals the m\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ajority of people undergo is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This state can only be ended with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
of the world today, which leads people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 It is no exaggeration to say that the coll\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ection of books by Harun Yahya have assumed this leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the 21st century will attain the peace, justice and happiness promised in the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an.

In order to experience true sincerity, one should first and foremost comprehend why sincerity is important. He should have a heartfelt desire to attain such a level of faith. Because, any person who fails to comprehend the importance of sincerity may then

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 For instance, let us assume that a task deemed favorable by\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0

Every human who succeeds giving due honor to Allah, knows that there are no forces but Allah, and never fears any one but Him. He also knows that nothing could ever happen without His consent. This understanding enables him to continuously worship Alla
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 h in a pure, sincere and untainted fashion. If he is to do a good deed, he does it not because he is afraid of others people\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s reactions, but because he will fail to fulfill Allah\hich\f0 \rquote 
\loch\f0 s commands if he does not do it. Similarly, he gives up any deed or form of\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 behavior, not because he thinks he will be exposed to the anger of others, but because he desires to win Allah

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 For instance, when people who work in an office are asked to donate to a charitable foundation, some wil\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 l see the opportunity as a requirement of the morality of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0

ate, "He is the only one who didn\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
t donate," or "He probably has no money." Thus, they act reluctantly, not sincerely wanting to give any money. However, they feel forced to do so, since they do not want to be perceived negatively by others. It is certain\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 that the recompense for these alms in Allah\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s presence will be very far from the recompense for alms donated by sincere believers. Such people have tainted their sincerity and have strayed from the morality of the Qur\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 an. However, those who act out of fea
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  of Allah may hope to be rewarded by Him. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 The difference between those who fear others and those who fear Allah could also be observed under adverse circumstances. For instance, let us take the example of a man who made a habit of making use of unfair adv
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
antages in his office. If this man remains unaffected when reminded that his acts will not be accepted by Allah, though stops as soon as he is told that his immoral actions will be revealed in detail to his colleagues, then it will be impossible to assert
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
that he is sincere. Although it might have appeared outwardly that he had stopped acting immorally, he is, nevertheless, insincere. He has corrected his actions not out of his fear of Allah, but out of his desire to protect himself from the wrath of his c
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
lleagues. However, he will always be able to make amends for what he did. If he sincerely repents and corrects his way of thinking, he may then act sincerely. It is very important for anyone who wishes to act sincerely to heed the right approach as in the
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 In general, these reactions stem from attaching too much importance to what people say, and think. Sometimes people feel the pangs of their conscience, not because they have committed \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
a wrong, but because others have come to know about it. However, if a wrong is committed, the fact that Allah knows about it is truly what matters. And, once again, one should turn only to Allah to seek repentance. When one feels no responsibility whatsoe

However, it should always be kept in mind that, not only those who devote themselves to this worldly life, but also those who expend effort to acquire benefits both in this world and the hereafter, are deluded. The life of this world was create

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 However, true good is in offering one\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s favorite possessions immediately when he sees that another is in need. If his possession had been so dear to him, then the other person will enjoy and be

\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 y to thank him. As indicated in the verse "}{\b\f0\insrsid10763464\charrsid7084197 \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 race each other to the good,}{\f0\insrsid10763464\charrsid7084197 
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 " what is truly representative of sincerity is to immediately embark upon a task and to complete it in the best possible manner. Such an act is also a sign that the said person prefers \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
his brothers to himself. He chooses difficulty over comfort and ease, with thoughts of self-sacrifice such as, "Let me be tired instead of my Muslim brother," "Let me be burdened with the difficulty of this work while he rests," or "Let myself and not he

 published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by Allah. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they di\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
versified over time through small changes. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Darwin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 
s theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled "Difficulties of the Theory\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
," the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
 the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the "evolution\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 ary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution.

The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
 species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the alleged evolutionary process it has to b

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any des
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 ign, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biology.

\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 In his book\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, the theory asserting that non-living m
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
terials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was it understood that worms did not appea\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
r on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Even in the period when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\insrsid10763464\charrsid7084197 \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 The Origin of Species}{\f0\insrsid10763464\charrsid7084197 \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 However, five years after the publication of Darwin\hich\f0 \rquote \loch\f0 s book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, which disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin

\par }{\f0\insrsid10763464\charrsid7084197 \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the quest\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ion of "how we see." Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of vision. These el
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 ctric signals are perceived in this centre of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dark, and light do\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
es not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pit
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 h darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and look arou
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
nd you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimen
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
ional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpos
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional pe
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 spective having depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch it without 
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, tha
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 t all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by c\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
hance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear; the middl
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
 ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 The situation \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpe
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
t sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorde\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
rs, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound p
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
rceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound before the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 
usic starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound exactly as 
\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 t is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 However, as far as seeing an\hich\af0\dbch\af36\loch\f0 d hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this.
