\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, thei
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nal Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and S\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian.

Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
irectly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
refutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage ot\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hers to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary pow
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbeli\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ef. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corrupt
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 on and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfir\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A special chapter is assigned to the collapse of the theory of evolution because this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwinism rejects the fact of creation
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and therefore, Allah's Existence\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very important duty to show everyone that this th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par

ed with beauty, goodness, justice, equality, plenty, comfort and tranquillity, and an immortal life in the next world in such grandeur the like of which the human mind cannot even imagine. The prophets of Allah, and the holy books which He sent down as a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uide to humanity, have brought this invitation to all people without exception throughout history.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One such offer, made to all of humanity through the Qur'an is a great opportunity, a great blessing and a great benefaction of Allah for those who choose to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
take advantage of it. People of conscience should thus examine the Qur'an carefully, lest they heedlessly pass up an opportunity they will later regret. On the Day of Judgment, those who ignored the truths of the Qur'an will be remorseful, but unlike the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 xample we gave above, there will be no second chances. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When that difficult day comes, those who today refuse to accept the invitation of Allah will say, "}{\b\f0\fs22\insrsid3226146\charrsid3226146 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If only you could see when they are standing before the Fire and saying, 'Oh! If only we could be sen\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t back again, we would not deny the Signs of our Lord and we would be among the believers.' " (Surat al-An'am: 27)}{

corresponding reward or punishment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What requires most attention these days is the fact that a great many people are resistant even to reading the Qur'an, though they do not know what it contains. Because of ingrained prejudices, and without knowing what k

ind of life to which Allah invites them, a majority of people shy away from the Qur'an. They do not evaluate it in an impartial and unprejudiced manner and, so, reject the invitation of the messengers. Being in a state of heedlessness, with fixed ideas, t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ose who reject this invitation are unwittingly heading towards devastation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The purpose of writing this book is to alert people about this prejudiced viewpoint which will ultimately cause them to suffer great losses in this world and in the next. It is to \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
invite everybody, whether or not they are believers, to read the Qur'an and consider the verses of Allah with an open heart and mind, as all pious believers have done before them, cleansed of all prejudices, rote "knowledge" and fixed ideas. This reminder
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is also of benefit to Muslims who say they believe in the Qur'an but who are not guided by its instructions. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is worth remembering that all the prophets who were simply messengers from Allah inviting people to have faith in Allah and His religion, were \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
met with resistance, denial and rejection from their communities. So when we talk about "people who do not heed the Qur'an," or "people who avoid the Qur'an," in this book, we should remember that this is not unique or special to the Qur'an: all the proph
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ts have been faced with similar rejections. There have always been people who do not heed the prophets and their message, and who have thus ignored the reality of the message from Allah.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Our purpose is to invite people to think about what is contained in t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he Qur'an and to submit themselves to Allah while there is still time. Recall Allah's statement:

trive to avoid falling into such a position. In fact the call to the Qur'an is an opportunity for people to cleanse themselves of their superstitious, mistaken and incorrect ideas. In such circumstances the intelligent way to behave is to listen to the pe

 the same way year after year; and their laughing at the same jokes, are just a few examples of these fixations. Because of this for years they cling on to the same ideas, even though they are incorrect, and they retain the same black and white ideas of r

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There do not need to be a large number of such people. It is enough for them to be people who are materially and morally influential in the community, who have economic power in their hands, and who possess the

means to direct society's thinking. In this way they can easily communicate their ideas to the masses, thus directing them. Because of their means, they succeed in making the majority of people think, speak and organise their lives in the godless way they

In general, many people follow unquestioningly community leaders like those described above. Such followers are those who have surrendered themselves to the race of life; they tag along on the leader's path without really being aware of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 heir ultimate aims, and without realising what kind of life they have embarked upon. They agree to the leaders' every word, obey it scrupulously, and so are caught up living their lives according to this misguided direction.

s commandments for a religious way of life. He resorts to pat answers such as, "Everybody does it that way, they reject the faith too, I have seen them behave this way also!" Because of this mindset, independent, free thinking becomes impossible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Because t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

king?" Without feeling any need to consult their minds and consciences, they accept both what is right and what is wrong from their community and live their lives accordingly. The sole excuse they can produce for their beliefs is that they are generally a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cepted by the communities in which they live.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Rejecting Allah's verses and adopting their own flawed logic and thinking deceives them into belief in "the power of the masses." A natural result of this deception is that the bigger the community in which the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 individual lives, the higher the power of sanction the masses over him. Acting in unison with a mass community makes independent thinking and decision making difficult. Because of the "conform to the majority" philosophy, even if they know what is right 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nd true, they hold back from expressing it, and conceal their sincere opinions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the most prominent examples of this is materialist scientists who promote the theory of evolution on a worldwide scale. Believers in evolution think that it is true beca\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
use it has been expounded for many years. They proceed from the idea that if everybody believes in it, they must believe in it too and arrive at the conclusion that if everybody ignores scientific facts, then so should they. Thus collectively they take on
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the duty of defending the theory of evolution blindly and in spite of everything. To carry out a scientific struggle against this worldwide organized lie is to grapple with millions of people.

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 herwise a person cannot reasonably reject it. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We find this is frequently the situation for those who turn away from the Qur'an: though they have not studied it, they assume they know what it contains, based on their own prejudices, conjectures, or "receiv
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed wisdom" from their societies. Discarding the Qur'an without having the slightest knowledge of it is a clear indication that these people are insincere.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In fact dismissing ideas without first studying them is a common practice amongst people. Many people\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, though they cannot understand the ideas of those who differ from them, do not want to read their books because of their own fixed ideas. Communists read only books that support their own ideas, fascists read books with fascist ideas, atheists read the w
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rks of other atheists, and so on.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, for a person who is not willing to study a subject, and basing their discussion only on their own presumptions, it is difficult to explain the correct and incorrect aspects of their thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But for those who wan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t correct and accurate information, it is important to be informed on every subject, otherwise it is easy to be influenced and misled. A knowledgeable, cultured person, who thinks independently and has a wide horizon, is capable of deeper and more detaile
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  analysis and his ideas are based, not on rote learning, but on concrete evidence. Thus most of the time it is easier for such people to indicate what is right and explain what is wrong.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For people with faith, being knowledgeable in a wide spectrum of topi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
cs is important for a different reason. A faithful person who has a deep knowledge of the Qur'an and is at the same time cultured and possesses a wide range of knowledge has a clear point of view and is more accurate in decision-making than those around h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
m. For example, a believer who knows the dangers of atheist ideologies, their logic and the systems which they promote can appreciate the superiority of the morality laid down by the Qur'an in much greater depth. A person with a deep knowledge of such ide
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
logies as fascism or anarchism which are opposed to the Qur'an, discovers how the Qur'an discredits these ideologies, and realizes the harm they do to humanity, and in this way can explain that harm and the failings of these ideologies to others.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 From this\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 point of view, during a period when people are competing in their resistance to the faith, what is required of every Muslim is to be informed about ideas, to develop himself for a scholarly struggle against ideas that oppose the Qur'an, and to widen his 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
eneral cultural knowledge and understanding of the world. To remain silent in the face of opponents through lack of knowledge, to be incapable of thinking, and to be unable to produce accurate responses to challenges from the other side is inappropriate f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r a Muslim. What is required is, on the one hand, to live wholeheartedly and with great desire, determination and faith, the truths contained in the Qur'an, and on the other, to comprehend the harm, evil and corrupt aspects of ideas opposed to the Qur'an.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Muslims will be unable to counter those who oppose religion if they cannot engage skilfully with their ideas.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition, recognising the idolatrous religions, of which Allah speaks in a number of verses of the Qur'an, is important to realise the extent t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
o which true religions have suffered degeneration through perversions. In this way it is possible to see how those pagan religions that existed in the past have also emerged in our time. In fact when the Qur'an speaks of other religions, Magians, polythei
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ts and societies which worshipped al-Lat, al-'Uzza and Manat, it is drawing the attention of the faithful to the need to be informed on these matters. Hence a Muslim needs to know about other faiths and ideologies, to read their books and to be informed a

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
In fact the Qur'an indicates a wide array of subjects on which a Muslim needs to be informed, such as biology, astronomy, botany, geography, history, chemistry, psychology and the arts. There are verses that show that a knowledgeable 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both dep

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one gener
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tion to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3226146\charrsid3226146 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before passing o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is comple\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the "center of vision" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The imag\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look aroun
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nal, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose.
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional pers
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without pu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have bee\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brai
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Neverthele
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ss, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, comp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high-fidelity s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ystems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the e
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. How
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ver, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concer\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0
