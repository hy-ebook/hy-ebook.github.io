 he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientif
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
c, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism.

 (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represen\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ts the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godle
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
s ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 All \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted id
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ologies. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Al
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 banian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His boo\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ks' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ,\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contempo
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. N\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
o material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Meanwhile, it would only be a \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous expe
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books i
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeal\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

Even if it is assumed that these did emerge, it is impossible for them to have given rise to proteins, RNA or DNA by means of chemical reactions or chance. That is because proteins, RNA or DNA contain the most concentrated amounts of

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Careful attention reveals that the NAS authors ignore both facts, and attempt to gloss over the second in particular by employing a style that gives them away: many pe\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

ind evidence for the theory of evolution will suffer a grave disappointment. The chapter contains subjects which evolutionists never cease repeating, like a mantra, even though their invalidity has been proved time and time again. Naturally enough, "natur
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 l selection," regarded as one of the fundamental mechanisms of evolution, heads the list of these mantras. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The correct definition of natural selection, which was known well before Darwin, is this: Those living things whose features are best suited to the \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
conditions in their surroundings naturally have a better chance of survival. For instance, in a place where winters are long and the ground remains covered with snow for extended periods, white-furred rabbits will be better camouflaged and fall prey to pr
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
dators less often than darker ones, giving them a greater chance of surviving, and thus of reproducing. This being the case, the proportion of white-furred rabbits in the population will keep rising, while the relative number of dark-furred rabbits will d
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
cline. To give another example, in a herd of zebras which constantly have to flee from leopards, those which run fastest will survive while the others die. Since fast runners will survive in every generation, the herd will come to consist of nothing but f
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 st runners in a few generations' time. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 That is the definition of natural selection: the best-adapted survive, while the others are eliminated. That is why the species in question continues to become ever better adapted. This may not always apply, of cours
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e. For example, in an area where the climate is changing and the snow covering is disappearing\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 say, due to global warming\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
the white rabbits would suddenly be at a disadvantage compared to dark rabbits, and so, having now become poorly adapted, they would \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 b\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
e doomed to disappear. Therefore, natural selection cannot always be expected always to select the same features for a given species.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Evolutionists, however, believe that natural selection selects and gradually accumulates the same features in a species ov\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
er millions of years, acting on variation within a species and then somehow giving rise to entirely different species. The fact is, however, that even if natural selection did always select the same characteristics, this would only lead to the improvement
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
of certain features in living species by spreading advantageous characteristics throughout the whole population. It could not lead to these beings' acquiring totally new characteristics. Much less, then, could it afford them the opportunity to turn into o
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 her species. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Rabbits always remain rabbits, and zebras remain zebras. That is because the genetic pool (genome) of a species prevents it from turning into another one. A species can only change to the extent permitted by its genes. 

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Darwin, however, loade\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
d an extra meaning onto natural selection over and above this scientific definition, and suggested that it was the basic mechanism of evolution. According to Darwin and contemporary evolutionists, natural selection, devoid of any reason or consciousness,

egan with a single-celled bacterium and gradually, over billions of years, created such marvels as trees, birds, flowers, ants, deer, parrots, strawberries, oranges, horses, peacocks, and human beings. It is clear that this claim is inconsistent and unsci

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Stephen Jay Gould, one of the theory of evolution's most prominent supporters, says that evolutionis\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ts are seeking from natural selection a power it does not possess:

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
cannot be tested, for which reason they are not scientific. A simple example of a tautology is "All hats are hats." This is a true sentence, but one which provides no information and explains nothing. Tautologies are often employed in jokes and poetry, bu
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  they should not be employed in scientific accounts. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Science explains effects in terms of causes. Since causes and effects are different things, they cannot have the same causal explanation. In a tautology, however, the cause and effect are the same, so n
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
o explanation is actually given, only the impression of one. When a doctor says, "Your father's hearing impairment has caused his deafness," that is a tautology. The doctor is offering no explanation at all of your father's deafness. The sentence contains
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 two parts that appear to be cause and effect, but actually mean the same thing. One does not explain the other. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In addition to failing to explain anything, tautologies cannot be regarded as scientific because they cannot be tested and can never be refuted\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 . 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
Natural selection is also formulated as a tautology by evolutionists. Natural selection is the survival of the fittest, and the tautology appears in the expression "of the fittest." "The fittest" are defined as those which survive. When we ask "Who are 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 the fittest?," we are told "Those which survive." The answer to the question "Who survives?" is "The fittest." This means that natural selection is "the survival of the survivors." This is circular reasoning. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Some evolutionists maintain that natural selec\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
tion is not a tautology, and that this is a misinterpretation by the proponents of Creation. The fact is, however, that prominent evolutionists also accept that natural selection is a tautology. That is why we feel the need to devote some space to stateme

The word species gene\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
rally brings to mind kinds such as dogs, horses, spiders, dolphins, and apples. The theory of evolution's claims regarding the "origin of species" bring to mind the origin of these life forms. Biologists, however, define "species" in a different way. Acco
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ding to modern biology, a living species is a population consisting of individuals which can mate and reproduce amongst themselves. This definition separates groups of living things that we think of as single species in daily life, into many more species.
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 For instance, some 34,000 species of spider have been described.3
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In order to understand the deception in evolutionary theory with regard to speciation, "geographic isolation" first needs to be clarified. In every living species there are differences stemm\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ing from genetic variation. If a natural obstacle such as a mountain range, a river, or the sea comes between two populations belonging to a given species, and the populations thus become "isolated" from one another, then in all probability different vari
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
nts will begin to dominate the two separated groups.4 For instance, variant A, a dark-colored and long-haired variation, might come to dominate one group, while variant B, a shorter-haired and lighter-colored variation, might become predominant in the oth
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
r. The more the two populations are separated from one another, the more the two variants become distinct. Cases of variation like these, with distinguishing morphological differences among subgroups of the same species, are known as "subspecies." 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Here th\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
e speciation claim enters the picture. Sometimes it happens that when variants A and B, after having split away from each other due to geographical isolation, are brought back together in some way but are unable to reproduce with each other. Since they ar
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  unable to reproduce, they cease being subspecies, according to the modern biological definition of "species," and become separate species. This is known as "speciation."
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Evolutionists, however, make the following unwarranted inference: "There are some cas\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
es of speciation in nature by natural means; therefore, all species emerged in this way." However, there is a major deception concealed within this argument.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Two important elements of this deception are:
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 1)\tab Variants A and B, geographically isolated from on\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
e another, may not be able to reproduce when they come together. Yet this generally stems from "mating behavior" differences. In other words, individuals belonging to variants A and B do not mate because they regard the other variant as foreign to themsel
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 v\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
es. However, there is no genetic impediment to their reproducing. For that reason, they are still members of the same species from the point of view of genetic information. (In fact, for this reason the concept of "species" continues to be the subject of 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 d\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ebate in biology.) 
\par }{\f42\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 2)\tab 
The really important point is that the "speciation" in question is not an increase in genetic information, but on the contrary stems from a loss of such information. The reason for the differentiation is not that new genetic informat
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ion has been added to one or other of the variants. There is no such addition. For instance, neither of the variants acquires a new protein, enzyme, or organ. There is no "development" here. On the contrary, instead of a population which had previously ha
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
bored different sets of genetic information (in our example, a population possessing both long and short hair, as well as both light and dark colors), now there are two populations that are both impoverished from the point of view of genetic information. 

\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
For this reason, nothing about speciation supports the theory of evolution. The theory of evolution claims that living species evolved from one another, from the simpler to the more complex, completely by chance. For the theory to be taken seriously, ther
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
fore, it needs to posit a mechanism for increasing genetic information. It needs to be able to explain how living things without eyes, ears, hearts, lungs, wings, feet, and other organs and systems came to acquire them, and where the genetic information d
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
scribing such systems and organs came from. A mechanism that divides an already-existing species into two groups, each of which undergoes a loss of genetic information, clearly has nothing to do with this. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 This is in fact accepted by evolutionists. For th\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
is reason, they define variations within a species and instances of speciation by division of a population into two parts as "microevolution." Microevolution is used in the sense of variations occurring within an already existing species. Yet the inclusio
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 of the term "evolution" in this description is a deliberate deception. There is no evolutionary process here at all, not even a "micro" one. This process merely distributes genetic information that already exists within the genetic pool among a different
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 combination of individuals.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
The questions that need to be answered are these: How did the living categories first come into being? How did the kingdoms of the Monera (bacteria), Protista (amoebas), Fungi (mushrooms), Plantae, and Animalia come into being? 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
How did the higher taxonomical categories of families (cats and dogs), orders (carnivores and primates), classes (birds and mammals), and phyla (chordates, arthropods, and molluscs) first come into being? These are the issues that evolutionists need to be
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 able to explain. 
\par }{\f42\expnd-1\expndtw-5\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
Evolutionists describe their theories concerning the origin of these basic categories as "macroevolution." It is actually macroevolution which is intended when the theory of evolution is referred to. That is because the genetic variations
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 known as microevolution are an observed biological phenomenon accepted by everyone, but one which has nothing to do with evolution itself (in spite of the name), as we have seen above. As far as the claim of macroevolution is concerned, there is no evide
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ce for it at all, either in observational biology or in the fossil record.
\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 There is an absolutely essential point to be made here. Those with insufficient knowledge in this area may be deceived into thinking that "Since microevolution takes place in a very
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 short space of time, macroevolution could also occur given tens of millions of years." Some evolutionists do indeed make this mistake, or else attempt to use this error to make others believe in the theory of evolution. This is the form that all of Charl
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s Darwin's "proofs of evolution" in }{\i\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The Origin of Species }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
take. The examples put forward by subsequent evolutionists are all along the same lines, as well. In all of these examples, the genetic variation known to evolutionists as microevolution is used as \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
proof of the theory they describe as macroevolution. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Let us give an example to illustrate the error in this reasoning. What would you say if someone proposed to you the following argument? "A bullet fired into the air from a pistol travels at 400 km (250 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 miles) an hour. It will therefore shortly leave the Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon, and in the weeks that follow will eventually arrive at the planet Mars."
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 If someone made such a claim to you, you would immediately realize that it was a simple dece\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ption. The person making the claim is expressing only a very narrow observation (about the speed of the bullet leaving the pistol) and is concealing two basic facts, gravity and friction, which restrict the progress of the bullet. All evolutionists' attem
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 p\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ts to derive macroevolution from microevolution employ exactly the same method. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The upshot of this micro/macro evolution debate and evolutionists' "speciation" fairytales is this: Living things emerged on the Earth as "kinds" possessing structures that di\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ffered from one another. (The fossil record demonstrates this.) Within these kinds, variants and subspecies may appear thanks to the richness of their genetic pools. For instance, the "rabbit" type contains white-haired and grey-haired, and long-eared and
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
short-eared, variants within itself, and these have spread according to the prevailing natural conditions. However, kinds can never turn into each other. There is no natural mechanism that can design new kinds, or that can form new organs, systems, or bod
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 y\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 plans within a type. Each kind was created with its own peculiar structure, and since God has created them all with a rich variation potential, every kind produces a rich, but restricted, range of variation.

It is actually no surprise that "very little" shou\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

In the face of these facts, some evolutionists offer an explanation along the lin\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

ch into the large ground finch; if it is assumed that there is a drought every 10 years, then such a change could happen in as little as 200 years. He maintained that, with the addition of a margin of error, it might take 2,000 years, but that bearing, in

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 These statements were regarded as a salvation in evolutionist circles: the theory of evolution by natural selection, which had always f\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ailed in experiments and observations, was portrayed as having been proved. Grant's research was the theme of Jonathan Weiner's Pulitzer Prize\hich\f42 \endash \loch\f42 winning book }{\i\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

to be made clear that living species in the Earth's strata do not follow a progression from the simple to the complex. For instance, the trilobites, which lived in the Cambrian Period when the first animal phyla appear, possessed a rather complex eye stru
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 c\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ture. A trilobite eye consists of hundreds of tiny facets, each of which contains two lens layers. This eye structure is a marvel of design. David Raup, a professor of geology at Harvard, Rochester, and Chicago universities, says that, "the trilobites 450
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 million years ago used an optimal design which would require a well trained and imaginative optical engineer to develop today." 14
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Another point which needs to be made clear about trilobites is that the 530-million-year-old compound eye system has come dow\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

The fossils found in Cambrian strata belong to very different species, such as snails, trilobites, sponges, worms, star fishes, sea urchins, and sea lilies. A new discovery in 1999 even revealed the existence of two separate fish species, }{

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 1. Evolutionists both portray homology as proof of descent from a common ancestor and describe it as descent from a common ancestor. This is a tautology\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 in other words, circular reasoning\hich\f42 
\emdash \loch\f42 and scientifically s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 peaking proves nothing at all.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 2. There are also common structures among living things for which evolutionists do not claim an evolutionary relationship\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
like those between marsupial and placental mammals, for example. This means that the reason for common \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 structures is not a common ancestor.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 3. Contrary to what the NAS would have one believe, the similar structures in many living things are not caused by similar genes. This shows that they do not have a common evolutionary origin. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 4. In living things with \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 homologous organs, the developmental stages of these organs are very different. This again shows that these organs do not come from a common ancestor.

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ;then it turns around and says that the only explanation for common structures is a common ancestor.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Another error which Darwinists make with regard to homologous organs is hidden in the circular reasoning they employ. According to Darwin and his loyal fol\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
lowers in the NAS, common structures are both the result and proof of the theory of evolution. This deficient logic basically says that the theory of descent from a common ancestor proves homology, which in turn proves descent from a common ancestor.

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 This \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
is like saying first: "All red convertibles resemble each other; this is proof of the existence of a factory that produces all red convertibles," and then going on to say, "The best explanation of the fact that all red convertibles resemble each other is 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 hat they were all made in the same factory." There is no proof of anything here, merely an unproven hypothesis and phenomena interpreted in the light of that hypothesis.

species between which no evolutionary relationship can be constructed also possess very similar organs. The wing is one example of this. Bats (which are mammals), birds, and flying insects all have wings. Furthermore, in the past there were also winged, f

The incompatibility between the developmental pathway of homologous organs\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

Let us examine the NAS's account. According to the NAS, living things on islands such as Hawaii or Gal\loch\af42\dbch\af13\hich\f42 \'e1\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 pagos, which are surrounded by vast reaches of ocean, either e
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
volved from other living things in the region or else in some way evolved from "migrant predecessors" that came to the islands. There is a geographical obstacle between these islands and other land masses. For that reason, these living things adapt to the
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 features of a particular region and acquire specific features. As we have already seen, this is what biologists call "microevolution"\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
that is, variation, in which an organ does not acquire new genetic information and which is therefore not an example of e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 v\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
olution. As we saw in the chapter "The NAS's Errors Regarding Speciation," no species can evolve into another, no matter what that species may be nor how long it may remain geographically isolated. We examined in some detail in that chapter why it is wron
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 g\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  to portray variation as evolution.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In fact, that example is important because it introduces us to a deceptive method frequently employed by evolutionists. That is the way they refer to any change in nature, or even in society, as "evolution" and portray i
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
t as evidence for the theory. Sometimes, evolutionists employ an even more deceptive variety of this method and say, "Evolution is gradual change." According to this misleading definition, all kinds of changes could be portrayed as "living examples of evo
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 l\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ution." In fact, as we saw at the beginning, human cultural and technological change is even described an "evolution" and immediately linked to Darwinism. All these distortions are deceptions which can only mislead those who lack sufficient information on
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 the subject or fail to consider it properly. They show just how despairing the proponents of the theory of evolution are when it comes to finding evidence. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 On the other hand, the verbiage employed in the NAS book is also of interest. For instance, the NAS\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 authors suggest that some snail and fruit fly species found on Hawaii evolved from a few common ancestors that reached the area in the past. Yet, for some reason, there is no fossil evidence to back this up. The NAS is employing the familiar old evolutio
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ist logic, saying, "All living things came into being by evolution; that means they all descended from a common ancestor."
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Biogeography, the geographical distribution of living things, offers no evidence of evolution. This branch of science concerns such s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

The most important aspect of the matter is that the "biogenetic law" was actually based on a scientific fraud. In order to prove his theory, Haeckel drew distorted pictures of the embryos of different living things. These embryos were depicted as being ve

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 There were various aspects to the fraudulent nature of Haeckel's drawings:
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 1.\tab Haeckel selected only those embryos that he regarded as fitting his theory. Despite there being seven classes of vertebrate \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
(jawless fish, cartilaginous fish, bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), he removed the first two classes and only included drawings of the last five. Moreover, half of the embryos he selected belonged to mammals, and all belonged to the sa
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 m\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
e subclass (placentals); he did not include any examples from the other two subclasses of mammals (monotremes and marsupials). As a result, Haeckel selected the specimens for his drawings in a biased manner and did not behave scientifically.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 2.\tab Despite Hae\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ckel's biased selection of embryos, even the examples he picked did not fit his claims. He therefore resorted to counterfeiting. In 1995, the British embryologist Michael Richardson produced a detailed study revealing that Haeckel's drawings were not corr

Let us examine the first stages of the vertebrate embryos and the forms they take in order to see this deception. When an animal egg is fertilized, it first undergoes a process known as "cell division." At the end of division, 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 the cells begin to move and organize themselves in a second process known as "gastrulation," which is more important than division with regard to the general emergence of body plan, tissue type, and organ systems.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 After division and gastrulation, a vertebr\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ate embryo enters the stage referred to by Haeckel as the "first phase." If, as Haeckel claimed, vertebrates possessed the greatest similarity during the earliest phase of their development, then different classes would resemble each other most closely du
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ing division and gastrulation. However, research into the five vertebrate classes given as examples by Haeckel (bony fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) shows that this is not the case. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The differences between the five classes are clear, even \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
in the fertilized egg. Zebrafish and frog eggs are about 1 mm in diameter; the turtle and chick begin as discs 3 or 4 mm in diameter above the yolk; while the human egg is only one-tenth of a millimeter in diameter. The earliest cell divisions in zebrafis
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 h\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
, turtle, and chick embryos resemble each other somewhat. However, in many frogs the embryos penetrate the yolk. Mammals are very different. Cell movements at the end of division and during gastrulation are very different in the five different classes. In
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
the zebrafish, cells move slowly outside the yolk, which brings about the development of the embryo. In frogs, cells move as interconnected thin layers, through a pore into the inner cavity. In turtles, chicks, and humans they flow along a channel into th
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 internal cavity of the embryonic disc. If the theory regarding the early development of vertebrates were correct, we would expect these five classes to resemble each other most closely as fertilized eggs, to show more differences during division, and sti

y relationship between the two. The claim takes this form in the NAS book: "each chain [that make up hemoglobin] has a heme [group] exactly like that of myoglobin, and each of the four chains in the hemoglobin molecule is folded exactly like myoglobin. It
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 was immediately obvious in 1959 that the two molecules are very closely related."
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 It is true that the molecules hemoglobin and myoglobin possess similar features. What is not true is the suggestion by the NAS and other evolutionists that this similarity co\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
nstitutes proof that hemoglobin evolved from myoglobin. These claims rest on no scientific foundation and are simply the work of evolutionist prejudice. Let us consider the reasons for this:
\par \bullet \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  It first needs to be made clear that myoglobin and hemoglobin a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
re two molecules with similar functions; hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood, myoglobin takes the oxygen from hemoglobin and stores it in the tissues, providing oxygen to the working muscles. It is therefore very natural that two protein molecules with
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
similar functions should have been designed to have similar properties. To draw an analogy, all transport vehicles possess similar features; they almost all have an engine, a steering wheel, wheels, and special sections to hold cargo or people. It is evid
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
nt that, because of these similarities, every one of these vehicles was designed for a specific purpose and possesses common features in line with that purpose. Hemoglobin and myoglobin are molecules designed for a similar purpose, for which reason they h
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ve similar features.
\par \bullet \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 When we look at the NAS claim in a little more detail, its impossible nature can be seen more clearly. According to the claim, myoglobin gradually evolved as a result of mutations, differences formed in the amino-acid sequence, and t
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
hus the hemoglobin molecule emerged. However, we know that both myoglobin and hemoglobin possess exceedingly complex structures. If either of these molecules is subjected to random factors like mutation, the molecule's function will be corrupted, as we sa
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 w\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 in the chapter on mutations, and it will become useless. The disease known as sickle-cell anemia is one example of this. Therefore, to expect a mutation which randomly changes a protein's amino-acid sequence to turn that protein into a more complex one w
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
th more features is to believe in the impossible. In order to prove the evolutionist claims, every transitional stage between myoglobin and hemoglobin needs to be functional (and more advantageous than the preceding stage), and that is impossible.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The A\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 merican chemist Dr. Robert Kofahl, a critic of the theory of evolution, makes the following comment on the impossibility of the claim that hemoglobin evolved from myoglobin:

It is claimed in the NAS booklet that the family trees obtained from comparing molecules such as cytochrome c and hemoglobin provide proof of the theory of evolution. According to this claim, the similarities between\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 the amino-acid sequences of these molecules in living things show that they evolved from one another. This claim is totally false. The fact that there are some similarities between molecules like cytochrome c or hemoglobin in some species is no proof tha

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 First and foremost, it needs to be made clear that, as we have just seen, comparisons performed on other molecules give very different and conflicting results, incompatible with any evolutionist picture
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 . 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
What biochemists have found with their comparisons of certain proteins like cytochrome c and hemoglobin is this: It is possible to classify species into groups according to their molecular structure. These groups are compatible with the groups produced 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 by comparative anatomy. However, the interesting thing in such a protein "atlas" is that these groups or subclasses are totally isolated from one another. No intermediate forms are to be found between groups\hich\f42 \emdash

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The Australian biochemist Michael Denton draws attention to the fact that tables such as the }{\i\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Dayhoff Atlas of Protein Structure\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Here is another noteworthy point in this connection: According to evolutionists, the most primitive organisms\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 those l\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 acking a cell nucleus

able to carry their weight on their feet as they walk because their upper leg bones and lower leg bones meet at an approximate 9 degree angle at the knee joint. In the chimpanzees and gorillas, however, the thigh and shin bones form a straight line, with

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
cations are based on comparisons of a limited number of proteins or genes. For this reason, when a comparison is carried out on another protein or molecule, it may give rise to very different or even conflicting results.

What is the significance of the fact that human DNA bears a 95% resemblance to that of chimpanzees? To answer this que\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 stion, we need to look at some comparisons between human beings and other living things. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 One of these comparisons provided the interesting result that there was a 75% similarity between man and worms of the nematode phylum.}{\f42\cf1\up6\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 18}{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313

ased on certain proteins have portrayed man as close to very different creatures. In one study carried out by researchers at Cambridge University, certain proteins in some vertebrates were compared. Astonishingly, man and the chicken were paired off as cl

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The picture revealed by these studies is this: there are genetic similarities between man and other living things. Yet, these similarities do not reveal any kind of "evoluti\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 onary scheme."
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
The existence of these genetic similarities is very normal, even inevitable. That is because the human body is made of the same materials, the same elements, as those of other living things. Man breathes the same air, eats the same food, and
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 lives in the same climate as animals. All life on Earth is "carbon-based"; in other words, it is constructed from organic molecules (carbon compounds). Therefore, a human being naturally has proteins and genetic codes that are similar to those of other l
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ving things. This, however, does not mean that man and other organisms share a common origin or that man evolved from other creatures.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In fact, genetic comparisons among living things have struck at the very heart of the 150-year-old evolutionary tree. Wha\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
t, in that case, could be the scientific explanation of the similar structures in living things? The answer to that question was given before Darwin's theory of evolution came to dominate the world of science. Scientists like Carl Linnaeus, who first syst
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 matized living things according to their similar structures, and Richard Owen regarded these structures as examples of "}{\b\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 common design}{
\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ." According to this idea, similar organs (or, nowadays, similar genes) are held to be so because they were intelligently d\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
esigned to serve a particular purpose, not because they evolved by chance from a common ancestor.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Modern scientific findings show that the claim of a "common ancestor" made with regard to similar organs is incorrect, and that the only possible explanation \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
is common design. In other words, living things were created according to a common plan.

Since the NAS authors are blindly devoted to the theory of evolution, they are even capable of interpreting evidence that works against the theory as evidence in favor of it. One example of this is t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
heir interpretation of the fossil record: according to the NAS, fossils are found in an orderly sequence in the Earth, and similar species are set out in consecutive layers. Evolutionists then portray this as evidence of evolution. However, this claim is 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 xceedingly deceptive and totally ignores the real message of the fossil record.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 It first needs to be made clear that even if living things were set out in order in the Earth's geological strata, this would still not be proof of evolution. In order for such\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 an arrangement to be considered evidence of evolution, fossils of those creatures that provided transitions between species alleged to have evolved from one another should also be found in the strata. As we have seen in earlier chapters, however, these t
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ansitional forms are nowhere to be found. Furthermore, beyond the fossil record, branches of sciences such as morphology, genetics, and biochemistry have all proven that such transitional forms are impossible. These branches of science have demonstrated t
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 h\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
at living species cannot descend from one another by evolution. In conclusion, even if there were a fossil sequence in the Earth, as evolutionists claim, this would not constitute proof of evolution.
\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The most important aspect of this is, without a doubt, t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
he fact that the evolutionary history referred to by the NAS does not exist. The Cambrian explosion, which is known to have taken place some 550 million years ago, is a clear indication that life on Earth did not come about through evolutionary developmen

The impossibility of the mechanisms favored by the NAS as gradually giving rise to evolution is evident. Moreover, the NAS authors, who claim that the blood clotting process may have gradually evolved by means of these mechanisms, need to prove these cl

iniest detail.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In the event of bleeding, clotting needs to take place at once if the creature is not to die from loss of blood. It is also essential that the clotting take place all over the wound and, m\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ost important of all, that it should only take place at the site of the injury. Otherwise, all the creature's blood will clot and solidify, which will kill it. Blood clotting, therefore, has to be kept under careful control, and has to occur at the right 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ime and place. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
The blood platelets or thrombocytes, particles produced by the bone marrow, possess an indispensable property. These particles are the main components of clotting. A protein known as von Willebrand factor ensures that the thrombocytes which
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 keep moving around in the blood do not go past the wound. The thrombocytes become caught at the injury site, and release a substance that brings others to the same location. Working together, these cells eventually close up the wound. Then, the thrombocy
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 es die, after having served their purpose. The way they sacrifice themselves is just one part of the blood clotting system.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Another protein that brings about blood clotting is thrombin. This substance is only produced where there is an open wound. There mu\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 f\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ibrin, soon form a network. This network covers the area where the blood is flowing out. The thrombocytes in the blood also attach themselves to this network. As this accumulation grows thicker, it stops the flow of blood by acting as a plug. What we know
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 as a blood clot is the plug formed by this accumulation. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 When the wound is completely healed, the clot falls apart.

irreducible complexity. The clotting of the blood emerges from a chain of events in which one component spurs another into action. A diagram setting out the process appears on page 240. It can be seen at a glance just what a complex process is involved. T

of a separate plan and calculation, reveals the perfection of creation. Our Lord Who creates us has created our bodies with this system, which protects us throughout the course of our lives from injuries great and small. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Blood clotting is important not ju\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
st for visible cuts, but also for the repair of ruptured blood vessels, something which happens in our bodies every day. Although you are not aware of it, you constantly experience tiny hemorrhages throughout the course of the day. When you knock your arm
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
against the door frame or sit down hard on a chair, hundreds of tiny blood vessels rupture. The hemorrhaging that occurs as a result of these blows is immediately halted thanks to the coagulation system, and the body later goes on to repair the ruptured b
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 l\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ood vessels. If the blow is quite violent, the hemorrhaging that occurs before clotting sets in is rather more violent\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
which is the reason "bruising" occurs. An individual who lacks this clotting system in the blood will need to be protected from the slig\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 h\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 which is linked to 11-cis-retinal. In this way, rhodopsin becomes able to bind to another protein called "transducin."

ion, let us have a look at the final stage of this interesting chemical reaction. The drop in the density of cGMP within the cell affects the "ion channels" in the cell. These are proteins that regulate the number of sodium ions in the cell. Normally, the

ion channel allows sodium ions to flow into the cell from outside, while another molecule expels the unnecessary ions, thus creating a balance. When the number of cGMP molecules falls, so does the number of sodium ions. This quantitative change gives rise
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
to an electrical imbalance in the cell. This electrical imbalance affects the nerves connected to the cell, and what we call an "electrical impulse" forms. The nerves forward these signals to the brain, where what we refer to as "sight" is experienced.}{

nitely supported by scientific findings, especially at the present time.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In order to see whether a theory is scientific, its claims must be tested by observation and experiment, and the results must be shown to be compatible with those claims. The explanat\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ion that living things are created with an intelligent design can be tested in precisely this scientific manner. What emerges from these tests is the fact that living things and the whole universe were created. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 We should also make clear that any unprejudi\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ced person who is capable of thinking freely, and who is not fanatically devoted to a particular ideology, can easily see that the entire universe and all living things were created with a flawless design. They are clearly the work of a Creator Who posses
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
es infinite power and intelligence. To see this, it is sufficient for anyone to consider his own body, or a single flower in his home, or the air he breathes. However, we feel the need here to set out some of the proofs that living things were created in 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ccordance with an intelligent design, in the hope that it will assist those people who are fanatically devoted to the theory of evolution to think and use their powers of reason.

 processes, but were created at a single moment, together with their particular body plans.
\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The most certain way of testing the truth set out here is by means of the fossil record, which definitively confirms the creation account. The life \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
forms in the layers of the Earth emerge fully formed, suddenly, and with all their individual features. The Cambrian explosion, which took place some 550 million years ago, is one of the clearest proofs that living things are created. The 100 or so phyla 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
n these strata emerge all of a sudden, with no evolutionary ancestors below them in the fossil record. The sudden appearance of life forms belonging to 100 different phyla, on an Earth in which there had only been single-celled and a few simple multi-cell
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
d creatures, and the fact that they possessed very different and exceedingly complex organs and systems, is of course evidence of an intelligent design, and thus of creation. The reason why the NAS authors neglect to refer to the Cambrian explosion even o
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ce throughout their book is their desire to conceal these facts.
\par }{\b\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 2.\tab The complex structures and systems in living things cannot have come about by random natural mechanisms.
\par }{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Another proof that living things are created is the complex structures and systems \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 that can only be explained by intelligent design. Many organs and structures\hich\f42 
\emdash \loch\f42 such as the cell, the bacterial flagellum, the blood clotting system, proteins, the brain, and the eye\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 all possess an extraordinary design and irreducible complexity. To claim th\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
t these systems came into being from unconscious, inanimate matter and as the result of chance natural events is even less logical than claiming that the video or television in your home came into being from a pile of scrap caused by an earthquake. If the
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 r\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
e is a complex, meaningful design somewhere, which cannot be accounted for by unconscious effects, then that means there is an intelligent power which brought that design into being. This much is self-evident.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 One of the irrational objections which evoluti\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
onists put forward in order to deny this obvious truth is the question of how design is to be identified. The answer to this is very clear. First and foremost, common sense shows us the way here. For instance, imagine you were shipwrecked on an unspoiled,
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
forested island, and believed yourself to be the first person who had ever set foot there. Then, if you came across an automobile upon the shore, you would not conclude that the car had come into being all by itself, as the result of chance. Despite the f
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 a\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ct that you had not seen anyone else on the island, you would surely conclude that that car had been designed and manufactured by other human beings, and placed on the island by them. That is to say, the evidence (the car) would lead you to understand tha
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 t\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  you were not the first rational being to visit the island. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Regarding the question of how design can be identified in biological structures, the scientific criteria put forward by the mathematician William Dembski may serve as a guide. In his book }{\i\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The Des\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ign Inference: Eliminating Chance Through Small Probabilities}{\f42\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
, Dembski mathematically shows at which stage it is impossible for a structure to be explained by chance and when the existence of an intelligent design is beyond dispute. Evolutionists are hopel\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
ess in the face of these criteria of Dembski's. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The way out of this dilemma sought by evolutionists is the same one we have examined elsewhere: they claim that structures referred to as complex could actually evolve by means of natural selection. Yet, thi
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
s is a very easy claim to test. For example, it can be observed in a laboratory whether, over thousands of generations, a bacterium lacking flagella comes to develop these irreducibly complex structures when exposed to mutations. If, as the result of this
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
experiment, flagella appear, the claim that chance and natural selection can lead to irreducibly complex structures will be meaningful. Even the appearance of a single new protein in that bacterium would be chalked up as a success for evolutionists. Yet, 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 n\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
o experiment has ever produced such a result. In fact, to conduct such an experiment would be as futile as observing a pile of scrap for a million years to see whether a jet airplane will emerge.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 In fact, we are witnessing the collapse of this strange logi\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
c, which is unable to see the most obvious facts due to a fanatical devotion to materialist philosophy. If a person sees a note reading "I SHALL BE HOME AT 10" on the table when he enters a room, he will not imagine that the note was written by chance
\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 say\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ,\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 by the wind blowing through the window and knocking over a bottle of ink. He will be sure that it was written by his wife or children. There is no need for an investigation using scientific methods here. The things that can come into being of their own a
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 c\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 cord and the things that cannot\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 that is, the things that are and are not the work of intelligent design\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
are in fact quite obvious. For instance, if you are walking in a forest and notice that a tree has fallen over, you will think that it fell over by its\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
lf or else was pushed over by the wind or some other force. However, if only the trees to the right of the footpath have been knocked over, you will realize that there has been intelligent design here, and that intelligent beings have come here and felled
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 the trees one by one, according to a plan. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Therefore, let us consider living things and creation. If we learn that, at a time when there was not even one living thing on the Earth\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
when the Earth consisted only of inanimate soil, rocks, minerals, and sand\hich\f42 \emdash \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
if under these conditions a cell no less complex than a city suddenly sprang into existence, this will prove that it was created by a force possessed of consciousness and intelligence. The same mind which knows that a camera cannot come into being by chan
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 c\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e can also see that the eye\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 which was the model for the camera and which possesses a far more flawless design\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
cannot have come into being by chance, either. A mind which knows that a dialysis machine cannot be the work of chance\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 that such a machine is des\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 i\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

capacity than the machine despite their much smaller size\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 
cannot be the work of chance, either. A mind which knows that thousands of intelligent, educated, experienced, and talented engineers, technicians, programmers, and designers joined forces to produ\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 c
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e a computer can also see that the human brain\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 with a complexity and abilities thousands of times greater than a computer's\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 could not be the work of chance, either. 

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Those who are blind to\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 these evident truths have slavishly devoted themselves to materialism and Darwinism, as if to a pagan religion. In order not to lose their materialist worldviews, evolutionists reject out of hand the ideas of all those who seek to offer a non-material ex
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 p\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
lanation of the world, life, and the laws of nature, without even listening to what they have to say. It is clear that the NAS authors and other evolutionists who criticize the truth of creation have never thought about creation or examined their own clai
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 m\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s. Their only aim is to hold onto their ideology, which the words they speak and write out of their anxiety to do so make abundantly clear.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Returning to the above example, we can draw an analogy to illustrate the peculiar position in which evolutionists fi\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
nds themselves. As you may recall, we earlier described how if you believed you were the first human being to set foot on a deserted island, you would naturally understand that other people had been there before you as soon as you came across an automobil
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 e\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
. But what if you were a person who was extraordinarily and doggedly convinced that he was indeed the first person on that island? In that case, you would have to account for the presence of the car, although none of the explanations you came up with woul
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 d\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
 be anything more than nonsense. You might persist in your illogicality, even to the extent of claiming that the car had been carried to the island from the nearest piece of dry land by a storm, or else that over millions of years storms had brought toget
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 h\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
er sticks and twigs, animal skins and bones, out of which the car had emerged. You might spend your entire life in coming up with theories in an attempt to prove that you were the first person on the island, and that the car had not been brought there by 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 s\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
omeone else. However, close attention would reveal that your true aim was not to discover the truth, but rather to defend the "fixation" under which you were laboring. In other words, you would be ignoring what the evidence plainly showed you, in order to
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 be able to continue believing as you chose. 
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Evolutionists are no less nonsensically and illogically stubborn and bigoted. Their aim is not to discover the true origin of life, but to keep the only ideology in their lives\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42 materialism\hich\f42 
\emdash \loch\f42 alive. That is why the\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 y fail to see the most obvious truths, or, if they do see them, why they hide and distort them. The NAS booklet is the clearest example of this.

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 Until recently, criticizing Darwinism meant risking a severe backlash. Teachers who criticized Darwinism were removed from their posts, scientists' papers were not published in scientific journals, and a fierce 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
negative propaganda campaign was waged against such people in the media. Yet, as the scientific evidence against Darwinism began to increase in quantity at a great speed, criticisms of Darwinism started to attract more support and have more influence. One
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
outcome of this was the effect on the education system. Many scientists, politicians, teachers, and parents who realized that the theory of evolution was not a scientific fact initiated an intensive campaign against the one-sided teaching of the theory of

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 First, there has been growing publ\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 ic recognition of the shoddy way evolution is actually taught in many schools. Thanks to the book }{\i\f42\fs22\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
Icons of Evolution}{\f42\fs22\cf1\insrsid3876313 \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42  by biologist Jonathan Wells, more people know about how biology textbooks perpetuate discredited "icons" of evolution that many biologists \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
no longer accept as good science. Embryo drawings purporting to prove Darwin's theory of common ancestry continue to appear in many textbooks despite the embarrassing fact that they have been exposed as fakes originally concocted by 19th-century German Da

winist Ernst Haeckel. Textbooks, likewise, continue to showcase microevolution in peppered moths as evidence for Darwin's mechanism of natural selection, even though the underlying research is now questioned by many biologists.
\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 When not offering students b\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

 The new critics of evolution hold doctorates in biology, biochemistry, mathematics, and related disciplines from secular universities, and many\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42

\par \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 The ranks of \hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 these academic critics of Darwin are growing. During the past year, more than 150 scientists\hich\f42 \emdash \loch\f42

As can be seen from the NAS booklet, evolutionists do not really consider the meaning of what they say and claim. For them, what is important is not the evidence and the real working of nature, but the defense of their ideology at whatever cost. 
\hich\af42\dbch\af13\loch\f42 
This is why they defend their irrational claims, which violate all known experiments and observations, under a "scientific" mask. As Columbia University professor Erwin Chargaff has stated, "Our time is probably the first in which mythology has penetrated
