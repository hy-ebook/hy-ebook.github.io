The author, who writes under the pen-name HARUN YAHYA, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on politic
al, faith-related and scientific issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as an author who has written very important works disclosing the forgery of evolutionists, the invalidity of their claims and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and bloody ideologies. 

\par 
\par His pen-name is made up of the names "Harun" (Aaron) and "Yahya" (John), in memory of the two esteemed prophets who fought against lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the cover of the author\rquote 
s books has a symbolic meaning linked to their contents. This seal
 represents the Qur'an as the last Book by God and the last word of Him and our Prophet, the last of all the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and Sunnah, the author makes it his main goal to disprove each one of the fundamental tenets of disbeli
eving ideologies and to say the "last word", so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. The seal of the Prophet, who attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, is used as a sign of his intention of saying this last word. 

\par 
\par All t
hese works by the author centre around one goal: to convey the message of the Qur'an to people and thus to encourage them to think about basic faith-related issues, such as the existence of God, His unity and the hereafter, and to remind them of some impo
rtant issues. 
\par 
\par Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries such as India, America, England, Indonesia, Poland, Bosnia, Spain and Brazil. His books have been translated into many languages, and English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, 
Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian versions are available. 
\par 
\par Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people putting their faith in God and in many others gaining a de
eper insight into their faith. The wisdom, and the sincere and easy-to-understand style employed give these books a distinct touch which directly strikes any one who reads or examines them. Immune to objections, these works are characterised by their feat
u
res of rapid effectiveness, definite results and irrefutability. The explanations provided in the books are undeniable, explicit and sincere, and enrich the reader with definitive answers. It is unlikely that those who read these books and give a serious 
t
hought to them can any longer sincerely advocate the materialistic philosophy, atheism and any other perverted ideology or philosophy. Even if they continue to advocate, this proves to be only a sentimental insistence since these books refute these ideolo
gies from their very basis. All contemporary movements of denial are ideologically defeated today, thanks to the collection of books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par 
\par There is no doubt that these features result from the wisdom and lucidity endowed them by God. The
 author certainly does not feel proud of himself; he merely intends to serve as a means in one's search for God's right path. Furthermore, the author makes no material gains from his books. Neither the writer, nor those who are instrumental in publishing 
and making these books accessible to the reader, make any material gains. They merely serve to earn the good pleasure of God. 
\par 
\par Considering these facts, those who encourage people to read these books, which open the "eyes" of the heart and guide them in becoming more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par Meanwhile, it would just be a waste of time and energy to propagate books which create confusion in people's minds, lead people into ideological chaos, and which clearly have no strong and 
precise effects in removing the doubts in peoples' hearts. It is apparent that it is impossible for books devised to put the stress on author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Tho
se who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the moral values of the Qur'an. The success, impact and sincerity this service has rendered are manifest in the reader's conviction. 

\par 
\par One
 point needs to be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty and conflict, and all the ordeals Muslims undergo is the ideological prevalence of lack of religion. These things can only come to an end with the ideological defeat of lack of fa
i
th and by ensuring that everybody knows about the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality, so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, which forces people into the downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, it is 
clear that this service has to be provided more speedily and effectively. Otherwise, it may be too late. 
\par 
\par It is no exaggeration to say that the Harun Yahya series have assumed this leading role. By the Will of God, these books will be the means through whi
ch people in the 21st century will attain the peace and bliss, justice and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

The reason why a special chapter is assigned to collapse of the theory of evolution is that this theory constitutes the basis of all anti-spiritual philosophies. Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation, and therefore the existence of Allah, during th
e
 last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. Therefore, showing that this theory is a deception is a very important duty, which is strongly related to the deen. It is imperative that this important service is render
ed to all people. Some of our readers may find the chance to read only one of our books. Therefore, we think it appropriate to spare a chapter for a summary of this subject.
\par Another point to be stressed is related to the content of the book. In all the books of the author, faith-related issues are told in the light of the Qur\rquote anic verses and people are invited to learn Allah\rquote 
s verses and live by them. All the subjects that concern Allah\rquote s verses are explained in such a way as to leave no room for doubt or question marks in the reader\rquote s mind.
\par The sincere, plain and fluent style employed ensures that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand the books. This effective and lucid way of recounting makes the books read quickly. Even th
ose people who rigorously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts recounted in these books and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents.
\par This book and all the other works of the author can be read by individuals or studied in a group at a t
ime of conversation. The reading of the books by a group of readers willing to profit from them will be useful in the sense that readers can relate their own reflections and experiences to one another.
\par In addition, it will be a great service to the deen to
 contribute to the presentation and reading of these books, which are written solely for the good pleasure of Allah. All the books of the author are extremely convincing. For this reason, for those who want to communicate the deen to other people, one of 
the most effective methods is to encourage them to read these books.

As you watch television, read the newspaper, or pass by somewhere, you run into many issues which you woul
d rather not hear about or see. People abandoned to hunger, murders, massacres, the oppressed unable to stand up for their rights, discord, curses, insulting and demeaning language, and general unrest, for which the blame can be attributed to conflicts of
 interests, and tyrannies and so on...
\par There is no doubt that you, like everyone else, would like to live in a society where people are committed to peace and security, where people hesitate to oppress or harm one another, and always hear good, loving, cari
ng, and honoring words from one another. Such an environment, ensuring a structure of relationships shaped by respect and love, is everyone's dream. As you flip through channels on television, turn the pages of a newspaper, at home or at your workplace, y
ou would love to see happy, joyful, friendly, sincere, honest, respectful people of good nature displaying moral perfection. Surely, you would like to hear nothing but good news. 
\par However, hoping that one day things will spontaneously change for the better 
would only be wishful thinking. Therefore, those who are sincerely willing to live in a society where peace, security and freedom prevail, should waste no time in taking action and be willing to make certain sacrifices.
\par Once you carefully evaluate events u
nfolding around with intelligence, conscience and common sense, you will recognize the existence of people who are whole-heartedly committed to establishing all the values of goodness mentioned above, and who devote all their time, resources and energy to
 
this cause. While these people, wholly devoted to an all-out effort to make righteousness and good prevail, are exposed to unfair treatment from time to time, or intimidated by those parties against goodness, you must never let it discourage you. That is 
because, by the Will of God, the people who strive for goodness will certainly triumph over those who are wicked.}{\b\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576

\par When you look around, as well as the good, you can also identify the evil ones and the type of society they intend to establish. In our day, the "evil ones" have established an apparently p
owerful alliance, and most likely, through their various methods, have silenced and intimidated many people advocating good morals. Behind all the evil you are not willing to acknowledge around, but which you can nonetheless not avoid, namely tyranny, cor
ruption, disaffection, hatred, mercilessness, injustice, poverty, gossip, everything that upsets, annoys and distresses people, lies this concerted alliance of the evil.
\par The good and conscientious should never remain indifferent to this ever-present menace.
 If this evil moves you at all and you hope for a trouble-free world, then you are evidently a person of conscience. Thus, before vice takes hold of you and blunts your conscience, you should ally yourself with the good, and for the rest of your life, dev
ote all your efforts to this cause. }{\b\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 Never forget that turning a blind eye to oppression and watching from the sidelines is oppression. }{

\par }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 In all corners of the world, there is evil, injustice, tyranny and wrongdoing. There are a number of reasons why people 
are witness to these negative realities which have become part of our daily lives. From the time a person acquires consciousness, he is exposed to an outpouring of news about such terrible happenings. Hardly a day goes by without encountering stories in t
h
e papers or on the TV, of swindlers, cruel serial killers, unprotected women, children and the elderly abandoned mercilessly to hunger and cold, all harrowing reminders that immorality, corruption, conflicts of interests and degeneracy are firmly rooted i
n society. 
\par The majority of people who witness such events consider them as events which befall others, and thus, as things that have no relevance to them. For this reason, they never assume responsibility for the unrest, corruption and mercilessness that a
ffects society. For instance, it may be that an innocent and defenceless person is exploited by a wealthier one, who insults and slanders him. In such an instance, everyone would recognise that the wealthy person is guilty of unjustly mistreating the inno
cent person. However, often, most people prefer to remain silent. They simply say "What difference would my words make?" or "This is none of my business", and turn a blind eye to this unfairness.
\par Undoubtedly, such situations arouse strong feelings and move 
a person whose heart is not so hardened. However merely getting angry, and disapproving, or feeling distressed, will in no way prove to be a hindrance to the recurrence of these harms. For this end, those who are conscientious and wish for the good of hum
anity should put forth a sincere effort and in every circumstance, lend their support to others who also strive for the good. 
\par However, in order to do so, one needs to be able to distinguish between the good and the evil. Today "goodness and evil" have beco
me relative concepts, varying according to the society, the type of social lifestyle and interests. For example in our day, caring for stray dogs and protecting their rights is regarded as an important mark of goodness. Similarly, making a few phone calls
 
to collect aid for a disaster-stricken territory is sufficient to be regarded as a charitable person. A person busying himself in his spare times with renovation of a school building, or meeting a few school children's needs, deems himself worthy of life-
l
ong honour and earns the respect and appreciation of the rest of society. Surely these can be considered acts of goodwill, yet, it is obvious that such feeble attempts are an insignificant contribution to the total eradication of all the wickedness that e
x
ists. As a matter of fact, these people also know that their efforts do not require great sacrifices. Some of them may even be aware that with such charity work, they can ingratiate themselves to people surrounding them, wanting to be admired for their ef
forts. Ultimately, another motivation for their interest in such charity work may be to ease their conscience.
\par However, the purpose of the "good", who are the subject of this book, is loftier and more noble. The "alliance of the good", formed by people comm
itted unconditionally to remain among the good and offer complete support to this end, acquires immense strength and brings forth unprecedented results in the shortest possible time. Grudge, hatred, mercilessness, insincerity, lying, injustice, penetratin
g into the societies of the world today, can only be removed by the "alliance of the good". Only people with high morals can stop the harm such corruption brings to the world. 
\par None of these goals should seem remote, imaginary or unattainable to the reader.
 As you read, you will also acknowledge that joining with the "alliance of the good" is amenable to anyone. Be they a housewife, a high school student, a tradesman, or a professor, every conscientious person living by moral principles and committed to the
 
dissemination of such values in society is capable of associating with the good. For this end, you must set aside your prejudices, presuppositions, and the ideas of right and wrong you have acquired earlier in life. The next step will be to look around yo
u
 to identify the true good and the true evil. In the process, you will have to adopt a single criterion: the Qur'an, the only guide sent to mankind by God. That is because, only God knows who are the truly good or the truly evil, and it is in the Qur'an t
hat He provides us a detailed account of the attributes of the good and the evil.

The only reason why a man conducts himself immorally is a lack of faith in God and the Day of Judgement and a lack of fear for God. Thin

 eternal punishment in the hereafter. For this reason, it is unlikely that a God-fearing person exhibits "devilish" characteristic. One of the verses of God forbids evil as follows:

You may hear people saying
 that they avoid those forms of mischief commonly practised in society though they do not believe in God and the Day of Judgement. However, it is a definite and evident fact that a person, who has never been involved in any wicked deed in his lifetime, ma
y
 possibly suddenly change this attitude once changing conditions seriously challenge his interests. When his career, for which he has worked day and night, or his wealth or life are at stake, for instance, he does not hesitate to cause harm to another per
s
on. We often encounter such people in our every day lives. In business life, in fear of being fired from his job for a mistake he has made, a person may well put the blame on someone else. Alternatively, a person who as a principle never accepts bribes or
 does anything unlawful, may find it reasonable to take a bribe for something urgent, for instance, when he has to pay his son's hospital bills.
\par If a non-God fearing person claims to be the most reliable and virtuous person in the world, it would definitely
 not prove to be convincing. Such a person may truly avoid committing theft or lying but he may lack good morals. You may not find an amicable, sincere and compassionate attitude in him, for instance. He may humiliate people in words or with his jokes, an
d
 the way he talks to people may have a disturbing tone. Similarly, a non-gambling person may indulge in a game when he is in an environment where gambling is popular. It would be unreasonable to consider a non-God-fearing man a truly righteous person, sin
ce he has an inherently weak-will that is prone to temptation because of a lack of fear of God. 
\par There are also those who relentlessly commit acts of immorality, disturb, degrade or defraud people, use abusive language, do not value people, think only of th
emselves, act aggressively and maliciously, and yet help the poor now and then. In such cases, we certainly cannot consider these people to be "good". The essential attributes of a good person are righteousness, honesty, justice, and sincerity. However we
 should also keep in mind that a good person who is sincere can also make mistakes and have certain failings, but what makes him different is his endeavour to purify himself of these flaws, and to exhibit moral perfection as best as he can. 
\par A person with f
ear of God shows good character, not only at particular times, but under all circumstances. His moral perfection is not dependent on the changing attitudes of people or of events and conditions around him, but the consideration of the heavy judgement awai
t
ing in the hereafter, and facing an outcome from which there is no return. With these factors in mind, he cannot dare to say a word or commit anything for which he would fail to give account in the hereafter. On the contrary, he pursues the bounties he ho
pes to attain in the hereafter. In the Qur'an, God calls man to ponder over the Day of Judgement:

Consequently, fear of God in one's heart is a sign of being among the good. A non-God fearing person who does not observe God's limits inevitably identifies himself w
ith the alliance of the evil. Possibly, he does not always actively participate in this wicked alliance, but, considering that conditions may develop at any time to in such a way as to prepare the appropriate ground for becoming involved in acts of wicked
nesss, he may, deliberately or not, side with the evil ones against the good.

In one's efforts to distinguish the good from the evil, an important point
 needs also to be considered: despite the fact that a great number of people say they believe in God and the Qur'an, in the way they live their lives and their attitudes, they are at variance with Qur'anic principles. In Surat al-Baqara, God reveals the r

Among the people there are some who say, 'We believe in God and the Last Day,' when they are not believers. They think they deceive God and those who
 believe. They deceive no one but themselves but they are not aware of it. There is a sickness in their hearts and God has increased their sickness. They will have a painful punishment on account of their denial. When they are told, 'Do not cause corrupti

As these verses also inform, such people mainta

For instance, one would naturally raise doubts about the sincerity of a person who claims to be a Muslim if he were to wage a covert struggle against Muslims. If a person, for insta
nce, who claims that he attaches much importance to moral values, and looks for honesty and sincerity in people, advocates indecent people known for their immorality, and presents them as respectable people who have unimpeachable attributes, then this wou
l
d cast doubts on such a person's sincerity. Rather, the actual purpose of those who associate the concept of immorality with "courage", "modernism", "elitism" and "freedom" is evident. They tempt people with such terms to make them see immorality as a vir
tue and to indulge in degeneracy.

The majority of people believe Satan to be an "imaginary" being with no real existence, and merely a concept symbolising evil. However, God also created the jinn, angels and Satan, as He created man and all the other 
living beings on earth, though in another dimension. 
\par The most obvious characteristics of Satan are his disobedience to God and his arrogance. These aside, from the time God created the first human being, namely Prophet Adam (as), on earth, Satan set himse
lf to lead people astray and hinder them from the right path. This is revealed in the Qur'an as follows:

Satan has various methods he uses to prevent people from following their conscience and from the righteous way of God. He may instil in them apprehensions or direct people to what is wrong by way of his friends. Take, for instance, a person who recently s
t
arted performing his regular prayers or complying with the commandments of God. Some of his friends, who are under the influence of Satan, may ridicule this person or draw his attention to some other temptation at prayer times. If this person fails to hav
e
 a strong will and commitment to his conscience, then Satan may, within a short time, make this person stop practising his prayers by way of his friends. Alternately, a person helping the poor may be called a "fool" by his immediate circle and be convince
d
 into spending his money instead on a new car or a holiday. Satan, using the people around him, may make this person see righteous deeds as somewhat difficult to follow or even wicked, and thus prevent him from engaging in acts of goodness. At times, Sata
n makes one abandon one's best friends in their most difficult times, so that his own interests are not }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid6891576\charrsid6891576 affected}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 
. In such a case, a person faces a dilemma from which he has difficulty finding a way out. Attempting to be conscientious, he feels he has to hel
p his friend through a difficult time. On the other hand, he cannot free himself from the grip of personal financial concerns or other difficulties he would face if he decided to offer his help. When considering a course of action, a person usually assume
s
 he is merely in the process of making certain decisions and evaluating certain options. However, the dilemma he experiences does not result merely from conflicting ideas, but rather, it is a struggle between the voice of his conscience and that of Satan.
 
\par In brief, either by directly whispering to the mind or by way of certain people, Satan infuses man with negative inspirations, hinders him from conforming to God's way and following his own conscience, from engaging in good deeds, and talking graciously o
r making sacrifices. Those following in the footsteps of Satan, either deliberately or unintentionally, naturally take sides with him and throughout their lives remain among the evil. In the Qur'an, God explains the influence of Satan on man as follows:

Satan carries on a similar struggle against all people, but people who have fear of God, who guard against evil, conform to their conscience, and have a strong will, are not led astray by him. Weak-willed people having no deep-rooted

For the evil ones to unite and carry out activities against believers, they first have to find each other. Th
ey do not require any effort for this purpose. The alliance emerges spontaneously, and in the normal course of daily life. The appropriate ground has already been laid by Satan through various methods and tactics. 
\par Everything, from the people who would all
y against the good to the timing or the type of plots hatched are all predetermined. Never is a call made for this unification. The call is already inspired by Satan in the hearts of those "who carry discord in their hearts". Thus, without effort, they co
m
e together, hatch plots and plan their evil actions. In daily life, they hear the call of disbelievers and identify themselves with the evil. The grudge they feel towards the believers and the vehement hatred overflowing their heart are the source of this
 unification. God gives an account of the grudge disbelievers nurse in their hearts against the believers and warns them thus:}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10027491\charrsid6891576

While establishing their unification, they look for certai
n traits in a person; he has to turn away from God's religion, turn a blind eye to wickedness, readily commit evil acts, all the while, not feeling any pangs of conscience. The presence of a person who lives by the moral values of the Qur'an upsets the ev
i
l ones greatly. Hearing a single word reminding them of good character, righteousness, or honesty, is intolerable since such words would evoke the voice of their conscience which they never wish to hear. That is the reason why the wicked only enjoy the co
m
pany of the wicked. They are made happy by the presence of the wicked. They greatly wish for the strengthening of their evil union since they know a strong alliance of the good would harm them. For instance, a thief enjoys the company of thieves. Alternat
i
vely, homosexuals all speak the same language. No matter where they are, they find each other and are rarely apart from one another. That is because they are never despised for their wickedness among their own, but rather, are encouraged by people sharing
 
the same values. A person who slanders innocent people only feels at ease when he is surrounded with slanderers like himself. He listens to their views, boasts about his "accomplishments" and asks for their advice. In return, his companions tell him about
 their own immorality, the cruelty they have committed and the slandering they have done. 
\par So, what is meant by the alliance of the evil is this attraction of the wicked to one another. If there is anyone around who questions their wicked deeds, it terribly
 annoys them. That is why they never want to see such person around, and why the evil ones only enjoy the company of one another.

At a closer look, we also see that the essential characteristics of evil people today is also an insistence on avoiding the good, an obnoxious attitude towards them, arrogance, disobedience and rebellion. On top of all that, 
Satan is firmly committed to averting people from goodness and what is beautiful, and to leading them astray. 
\par All of these indicate that those who strive together against goodness and try to eradicate the faith people have in God and the Hereafter, and mo
ral values like sacrifice and loyalty, share the same common traits. However, it is impossible for these people to attain success; both in this world and beyond. God will pay them back what they deserve. That is because God is the friend and protector of 
His true servants:

Out of inherent jealousy and rivalry, selfish, ambitious, unscrupulous and malicious people can never take a joint action or co-operate. As a result, f

Nevertheless, despite the existence of these factions among them, some factors bring the evil together and make them act in unison. Before anything else, what makes them
 come together and unite for a common goal is, as mentioned in earlier sections, the influence of Satan has on the wicked ones. Their unification is not dependant on a call, a declaration or a written agreement. Indeed, in most cases, not a word is spoken
 
or a meeting held to establish a strong unity. Even those among whom there is constant competition, or who have problems with each other due to conflict of interests, forget all about their differences when a common goal is in question, and decide to unit
e
. This goal is the one commanded by Satan: to form a joint force against the good, against Muslims who believe in God and the hereafter, sincere, conscientious and honest people who are on the side of justice. In this way, they want to coerce the good to 
their side\'85 God gives an account of this secret call of Satan in the verse; }{\b\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 "\'85The Satans inspire their friends to dispute with you\'85"}{
\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 (Surat al-An'am: 121)
\par The ultimate aim of this alliance, shaped by the efforts and inspiration of Satan, does not differ from the goals of the evil of the past. 
\par Both in the past and today, the main goal of the alliance of the evil is to hinder the diffusion of moral values, like self-sacrifice, sincerity, honesty, conscientiousness and justice among people. No matter how such p
eople strive to present themselves as the advocates of goodness, and living by the principles of the Qur'an, these values will always remain an impediment to their attainment of their personal ambitions, that is, they do not suit their purposes. This is t
h
e underlying reason why they exert such an all-out effort to obstruct the spread of the Qur'anic principles and desire to have fewer good people around. Meanwhile, they wish the good to become diverted from the right path, and to join them. They always wi
s
h them to disregard the truth and pursue trivial aims and desires, as do the wicked, and become people who live only to eat, drink and enjoy themselves. Once the good start talking, thinking and writing like them, and conduct themselves towards the young,
 children and elderly in a like manner, they will be satisfied and stop opposing them. In several verses, God informs us that disbelievers are deeply committed to the idea of making the good side with themselves:

\par In the Qur'an, God states that the doers of mischief on earth, who are struggling to hinder believers from their noble cause, are guided by certain people who are, in Qur'anic terms, called the "the chiefs of the nation". A clos
e read of the Qur'an reveals that such leaders existed in every society and throughout history. These people attempted to provoke the masses against believers and, deriving power from their prosperity and social status, remained arrogant, aggressive and u
n
yielding. In the face of these leaders' apparent grandeur, based on wealth and temporal power, people generally feared them, and out of this fear, followed their way. As the Qur'an informs, however, complying with these people, and putting one's trust in 
them without listening to the voice of one's conscience, will be a reason to be dragged into hellfire. God explains this fact in His verses as follows:

The masterminds of this evil alliance and those directing it are actually those leaders who have influence over the masses. Coming together, these leaders ally against the good; and scheme to defeat them or to render them ineffective. In their endeav

As these verses also state, the leaders of the evil ones gather and take decisions against the good, and enhance their al
liance by bringing together those whom they hope to use against the good. Throughout history, those following the evil alliance, either out of fear, timidity or by being impressed by its power, followed the leaders of the evil. For instance, those who wer
e
 ruthless enough to massacre millions of innocent people under the command of leaders like the Pharaoh, Mao, Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot, or those who joined terrorist groups and killed people, would also maintain that they committed such acts because they
 
feared the cruelty of their leaders or were impressed by their power. In this world, there may be some people who may be fooled by their insincere explanations. In the hereafter, however, these explanations will be rendered useless. Such is the ultimate e

However, the power held by the leaders of the disbelievers would then bring neither benefit nor harm to them or the people following them. The possessor of all might and property is our Lord, G
od. No one can do any good or any harm to another person unless by the Will of God. Throughout history, believers having faith in this truth remained neither under the influence of Pharaoh, nor Nimrod, nor any other evil leader. Fearing God alone, they al
w

l
y a few young people took sides with Moses. Similarly, the magicians assigned by Pharaoh to hatch a plot against the prophet Moses (as) saw the truth and immediately followed him. Pharaoh's threats did not alter the belief of these brave and faithful foll
owers. The good conduct of the magicians is told in the Qur'an:

The magicians threw themselves down in prostration. They said, 'We believe in the Lord of all the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron.' Pharaoh said, 'Have you believed in him before I authori

\par }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 As stressed throughout the book, that the evil ally themselves against the good to render them ineffective, and t
hat they will strive to do harm to them, is a fact proclaimed in the Qur'an. God has made clear in several verses that people complying with the call of Satan will expend great effort to hinder people from living by the principles of the Qur'an. That is t
he reason why the good must always be alert and cautious of evil, and interpret all that happens around them in the light of the Qur'an. 
\par However, we must not forget that everything occurs within the destiny ordained by God, and that nothing happens by coin
cidence. There is a good and a divine purpose in such an alliance formed against sincere and conscientious people. God will reveal the good and purpose in such evil plans when He wills; either in this world or the hereafter. Accordingly, believers must re

The most a
pparent trait of an insincere and devious person is his presenting of himself as a totally different person. He seems to oppose immorality, rebellion, disloyalty, prostitution, and similar forms of wickedness, while he himself lives a despicable life. Typ
i
cally, such a person, would one day act as a fervent advocator of religious values, and another as a guardian of chastity, who sternly condemns others for their immoral conduct. As if he were the most honest or sincere person on earth, he would criticise 
t
he deceitful conduct of others, even as far as saying he is astounded by such immoral conduct and condemn it. Those who are unable to consider such things carefully and who readily accept anything they hear and see, are likely to be deceived by the type o
f person who feigns "innocence and goodness".

Another tactic employed by the evil to present themselves as good, virtuous, honest and sympathetic, is to sp
eak ill of the truly good. While they chastise them, they also claim especially that they merely want to protect the public from the "evil" of such people. The Pharaoh is the most glaring example, and one who went down in history for this very aspect. The
 
Pharaoh was a cruel, aggressive, vulgar, merciless, arrogant person who subjected his people to unbearable punishment and denied the existence of God. He strove to provoke his people against Moses, by showing him to be evil, and portraying himself as a pe

As stated in the above verses, Pharaoh attempted to make the prophet Moses (as) appear guilty in the eyes of the public, while assuming the role of a saviour and a self sacrificing person who cares for his subjects. Most likely, tho
se people who did not act wisely, and who were not guided by their conscience, were deceived by the lies of the Pharaoh and sided with him. However, the truth is evident today; both who were the evil and who were the good of that time are now known to us.

he Qur'an informs, throughout history, good and sincere people were blamed of sorcery, lying, opportunism, perversion, and subjected to various other forms of slander. That is why, in no period of history, believers who became the object of such slanderou

\par In the case of the Prophet Joseph (as), for instance, both his brothers and the wife of
 the master who adopted him plotted against him. However, there is a time, in absolutely certainty, when this plotting and slandering against believers will be punished. The slander made against Joseph by his brothers was the following:

Those who raised false charges 
of adultery against Mary, and the honourable wife of our Prophet, and the ones who blamed other prophets with perversion and sorcery, all shared the same attitude. They knew without a doubt that the blessed people, who exhibited moral perfection throughou
t
 their lives, were far too virtuous and noble to commit any of these supposed misdeeds. However, only to degrade these noble people in the eyes of the public, and to shatter the trust and commitment people placed in these true believers, they resorted to 
such lowly forms of slander. Some of the words disbelievers uttered according to this rationale are mentioned in the Qur'an as follows:

They are surprised that a warner should come to them from among themselves. The disbelievers say, 'This is a lying magi
cian. Has he turned all the gods into One God? That is truly astonishing!' Their leaders went off saying, 'Carry on as you are! Hold fast to your gods. This is clearly something planned. We have not heard of this in the old religion. This is merely someth

owever, these plots failed and ultimately back-fired. Believers, on the contrary, were publicly cleared of every accusation, and, as always, bore themselves with dignity. Prophet Joseph (as), who was charged with theft, for instance, was so evidently trus
t
worthy that the King entrusted Egypt's entire stores to him. People spoke against Mary, accusing her of being unchaste, although she has been preferred over all women. Prophet Joseph (as) also became the subject of a similar slander, despite the fact that
 he was a noble person, who meticulously observed God's limits. God informs us in the Qur'an that in the afterlife the accusers will be punished for what they have done to the believers:

Among the most recognised characteristics of disbelievers are greed and selfishness. Particularly, they avoid spending their money for a good cause. They are often reluctant to give away e
ven a portion of their money and property to earn the good pleasure of God. However, when they are called to evil, they never avoid spending of what they have. Furthermore, each group within the alliance of evil competes with the others in inflicting the 
most harm on the good. They motivate those who may be slow or perhaps hesitant in hatching plots against the good, and make sure they spend as much energy as possible towards this cause. 
\par These people, who never attempt to engage in anything good, strive to their utmost when it comes to something bad. God informs us in the following verse that they do not hesitate to spend their wealth for evil:}{

Disbelievers sometimes employ covert forms of threat. The tone of their speech sounds as if they are concerned with the good, safety and well-being of the good. They strongly advi
se the good not to collaborate with believers, and stress that that they say so to ensure their safety and well-being, and that otherwise, they will have to suffer the dire consequences. With this approach, they hope to imply that everyone who sides with

, they will never neglect to give promises to them to provide all forms of support and protection, on the condition of breaking with the good. The leaders of the Prophet Shu'ayb's (as) people also covertly threatened the followers of Shu'ayb:

Mocking believers and
 speaking ill of them are some of the methods adopted by the wicked against the righteous, in an attempt to humiliate believers and make them seem insignificant and worthless in the eyes of others. Their purpose in this case is to eradicate the good, to h
inder the spread of moral values based on the teachings of the Qur'an, and prevent people from following their way. 
\par The truly good, conscientious and sincere, also invite their fellow men to live by the same conscientiousness and sincerity. They are highly
 committed to communicating to them the blessings of Qur'anic morals, the reality of the Day of Judgement and the hereafter, and the importance of having fear for God. Their sincerity usually makes a positive impression on the majority of people, fosterin
g faith in God, good morals, righteousness, blessings, conscientiousness, loyalty, support, respect and love. Those harbouring enmity towards one another or otherwise dissidenting people unite, thanks to the positive influence effected by the good. 

\par No doub
t, such improvements to society are not in accordance with the plan of the evil, the envious and those indulging in immorality. In order to reverse these positive effects, the evil mock the good, accuse them of insanity, shallow-mindedness, bigotry, decei
t
, imposture, the intention being to bring them into disrepute. They think the views and efforts of a person who is portrayed as insane or as a forger could no longer win people's respect. This is a tactic which has been employed for thousands of years by 
deceitful and devious people, all disbelievers and hypocrites, but which has never attained success. 
\par History abounds with the stories of prophets, the followers of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), Islamic scholars and true Muslims, who struggled for the good of hu
manity and the improvement of morality, and who constantly met insults and mockery. The insults and mockery only revealed the true hatred and jealousy the wicked felt for the good. God informs us that what they hide in their hearts is far worse than what

As mentioned earlier, the underlying reason for the aggressive attitude and hatred felt by the wicked towards the good, is their not adhering to the wishes of the immoral and unscrupulous peopl
e who do not observe God's limits, and their considering God's commands and prohibitions over and above their own desires. Meeting a conscientious Muslim, who guards against evil and does not follow his ego (an-nafs), such people adopt an aggressive attit
ude and attempt to hurt him both physically and verbally. 
\par One of the terms most frequently used by the evil in their attack on the good is that of "insanity". As 
is stated in the Qur'an, many true servants of God were accused of being insane. No doubt, the accusers were very well aware that these people were by no means lacking in reason. On the contrary, they knew very well that everyone of them was a highly inte
l
ligent person with high morals. Yet, as mentioned earlier, the intention of the accusers is to shatter the credibility of the good in the eyes of society. The Qur'an also informs us that throughout history, the prophets and the righteous have been accused
 of insanity:

Wicked people are innately prone to using derision and sarcasm against the good. In this regard, both the good and sincere themselves, and the values they advocate, become the target of their derision. From the Qur'an, we learn that derision was something

One of the hopes of the leaders of evil is to lead a carefree and indulgent life, for which they will not have to give account, and so not have to observe any limits. As we have discu
ssed earlier, in doing so, they do not confess their real intentions, but instead employ deceitful methods to cover their aims. 
\par Firstly, they associate themselves with a group that consists of people who respect no principles, who do not feel any shame, w
ho openly perpetrate immoral acts and use vulgar language. These are the types of people who indulge in all forms of depravity, like homosexuality, prostitution, drugs or gambling. Nevertheless, regardless of their characteristics, some of them have earne
d
 positions of respect in society. They are often famous, or known as intellectuals or recognised for other talents. This being the case, their indulgence in immorality is regarded by the rest of society as acceptable. While otherwise socially inadmissible
,
 contemptible and despicable manners and behaviour somehow become tolerated in society when they are associated with such people. The immoral behaviour exemplified by them becomes a defining feature of what is considered "bravery, modernity, freedom and i
n
tellectualism." This not being sufficient, these people are also presented as role models, especially to the young, as if they are living a good life. Ultimately, society abounds with those who imitate these people. Their clothing styles, make-up, their m
a
nner of speaking, the way they deal with people, and even their preferences in home decoration or social relations, are adopted by their followers. In this way, within a very short period of time the majority of the society is lured into this form of dege
neracy. 
\par This process develops so rapidly that manners and conduct one would not dare to consider or even to utter, in just a few years suddenly become socially acceptable. For instance, attitudes towards homosexuality, once a highly scorned and denounced p
ractice, have changed dramatically in some social circles. It is no longer regarded as unusual to make close friends with homosexuals. Surely there exists an alliance somewhere that promotes this gradual transformation of social norms, by way of taking pe
ople within its sphere influence, through its concealed methods and organisations. It is the alliance of the evil.
\par Each and every member of this alliance, intentionally or otherwise, contributes to this degenerate propaganda, and supports its spread until t
he ultimate goal is finally attained. Considering the modern society of today, it would not be an exaggeration to say that certain fashion designers, film producers, song-writers, journalists, authors, movie directors, night club owners, etc. are involved
 in this alliance. (No need to say that there are always exceptions, with those who do not serve the purposes of this insidious alliance, and who remain conscientious and ally themselves with the good.) 
\par Committed to spread wickedness in all domains of life
, and to attract greater numbers of adherents to their alliance, the evil ones endeavour to keep the number of the good to the bare minimum. Yet, the fact remains that such efforts merely elevate the status of the good and increase the torment of the evil
. God reveals this fact in His verses:

Ultimately, it is a fallacy and misconception when some put forward various excuses to the good saying, "but these are the beliefs, moral values and the life-style maintained by the majority". Therefore, we
 must keep in mind that adhering to the path the majority follow is not necessarily the safest way, since, as also stressed in the verses above, it is nothing but a grand delusion.

As these verses suggest, at the time when Pharaoh almost allowed Moses and his adherents to leave, the leaders tried to change his mind by making up lies and unfounded slanders about Moses to provoke t
he Pharaoh into oppressing the prophet and his followers. As is evident in this example, the alliance of the evil always focuses its efforts on inciting the evil against the good. 
\par God, in the Qur'an, relates the following about such people who spread rumours about the good:

Another method t
he evil have employed for thousands of years to such an end has been to coax the good into a conflict against their brothers and friends. All civil wars, conflicts and senseless enmities that have come about in history, originated from the all-out efforts
 of the evil. As a result of the enmity stirred up by the provocation of the evil, fellow citizens, even close friends and brothers, struggled against each other, and tortured and killed one another. 
\par Also, in our day, through publications, speeches, lobbyi
ng and diplomacy, such people stealthily manage to bring two countries into a war, or stir up enmity among a people by dividing a nation into factions. This is an evil scheme that turns brother against brother. The purpose is to weaken these countries by 
civil wars and internal conflict so as to reconcile the structure of the target countries to their own goals and ideologies.
\par Another method employed by the evil alliance against the good is, as mentioned in previous sections, to portray some of the good as 
wicked in the eyes of other good people. To this end, they initiate underhanded strategies, ranging from spreading unfounded accusations to outright insults, so as to make the disparaging message "Look! We have unmasked the good; as you see, they are not 
on the right way." The intention in this case is to prevent the good to come together, and to support and protect the oppressed.
\par However, people of conscience who are able to analyse these tactics, so as to recognise and avert the secret plans of the evil, 
thanks to their conscience and sound mind, will never be deceived by such tricks. God warns believers against the traits of the evil in many of His verses, for example:

\par Consequently, you should keep in mind that, even if the alliance of the evil has provoked a whole city, or even the whole world against the good, Go
d protects and guards the good. No plot of the evil can hurt the good, scare or worry them, unless by the Will of God.

The leaders of the evil make promises to people and offer them certain privileges in order to attract them to their side. In the Qur'an, a promise given by Pharaoh to the magicians is related as follows:

However we should also mention that the evil alliance is in reality based on a rather feeble foundation. Every member has certain stipulations or a price in mind in joining the alliance. If they feel their
 personal interests are at stake, they lose no time in breaking with the alliance. That is because this alliance is not established on just grounds, but on falsehood. Every individual who does not believe in God and the hereafter, who has no fear for God 
and does not guard against evil, is afflicted with certain weaknesses, which the leaders of the evil take advantage of in every way they can, and which they use to gain further supporters. 
\par Also, in our day, promises of money, property, fame or status, are 
sufficient to convince most people to take action against the good. Accordingly, unless he has fear for God, a person who is offered such promises will readily become so cruel as to make up slanderous accusations or tell lies about an innocent and pure pe
rson whom he has never met. 
\par Contrarily, those individuals who side with the good only seek the mercy, consent and paradise of God. This alliance is formed according to the one and only just path of God, and those who are truly good never demand a "price". 
No worldly gain can divert them from doing what is right. In this regard, believers are following the messengers' examples. In the Qur'an, the messengers addressed their people as follows:

Throughout this book, we mentioned that the evil unite to eradicate religion and believers, and resort to numerous forms of oppression and pressure tactics to this end. The existence of people of faith is the main reason why the evil unite, because a beli
e
ver is the representative of Islam, God's true religion, and the guarantee of implementation of the moral values of the Qur'an on earth. For the evil, the threat of such a possibility requires the immediate removal of believers. What hinders the evil ones
 
from living by their system of unbelief and of evil morals are the limits set by God and the moral principles prescribed by His religion. It is to remove these hindrances that the disbelievers are so strongly committed to co-operating with one another. Wh
erever there is prostitution, bribery, imposture, gambling, swindling, cruelty to orphans and the poor, extravagance, lack of love and respect, immorality, there is the evil alliance.
\par  We are living in a period when the alliance of the evil has intensified 
their efforts, and believers, along with the innocent, poor and weak people, in all corners of the world, have been subjected to more oppression and suffering than ever before. It is essential that believers assess this reality according to the guidance o
f
 the Qur'an. According to the Qur'an, turning a blind eye to the ongoing cruelty, not engaging in an ideological struggle against the evil, watching everything silently and remaining inconsiderate towards the ongoing suffering in the world, is great oppre
ssion in itself. Keeping silent about the repression and cruelty inflicted on the Muslims and people striving to spread the morals of the Qur'an, makes one a silent member of the cruel alliance, or worse still, a participator in it. 
\par Glancing through newspa
pers or magazines should suffice to see the rapaciousness of this alliance. For instance, 10-15 years ago, homosexuality was accepted as completely unacceptable and was severely condemned. However, this fact has dramatically changed today, giving way to a
n
 actual advocacy of the rights of homosexuals, as far as presenting this perversion as modern and a normal and "personal preference". This outlook is propagated by the popular media and the entertainment world. The public's inculcation into similar immora
l trends as perfectly acceptable "preferences", thus laying the groundwork for their further diffusion throughout society, is merely a consequence of the evil plans orchestrated by the alliance of the evil. 
\par In this time, when gambling, prostitution, and mu
rder evoke little reaction, it is essential that people wake-up to reality. This is a time when the good, who are already deprived of their essential rights and freedoms, are oppressed and unjustly treated, whereas swindlers, murderers and tyrants have th
e
 freedom to do what they want. If innocent and defenceless people are murdered all around the world, merely because they have faith in God and because they say they are Muslims, and again, if those who call themselves "Muslim" can remain ambivalent to all
 
this suffering, and dares to refer to it with a smile on his face, then this is the work of the alliance of the evil. Restoring peace and securing welfare, happiness, justice, tolerance, love and respect in the world is only possible through recognition a
nd adherence to the values of the Qur'an. It is the believers  who are the living examples of this good character, and it will be the alliance of the good that will ensure the prevalance of the values of the Qur'an; this is the definite promise of God.

in general. It is clear that sincerity, conscience, honesty, compassion, love and respect, will eradicate immorality and all wickedness. In other words, the unity and co-operation of the good will defeat the alliance of the evil. In a verse of the Qur'an,
 God gives glad tidings regarding this fact:

The word "guardian" means intimate, protector, helper and supporter. In this sense, believers, honest, sincere and cons

The Prophet Moses (as

Because Prophet S
hu'ayb (as) recognized the inherent goodness and trustworthiness of the Prophet Moses (as), he helped him in his difficult time and allowed him to stay in his household and to work for him. Shu'ayb's manner sets an example for the good in protecting and g
u
arding other good people who encounter hardship. Unless the good offer help and support to one another in times of adversity, then they will leave each another alone and unable to defend themselves against the cruel people. In a verse of the Qur'an, God c

The religion of Islam ensures the est
ablishment of a better world where there is love, peace, tolerance and understanding to one another. Societies possessing these features experience rapid development and achieve greater power. Once unity and cooperation are attained, individuals of such a
 
society could channel their strength and energy towards goodness and good deeds rather than into disputes, fights, conflicts and wars. Essentially, a cause to which people commit themselves and devote all their effort, power, zeal and support, both materi
a
l and spiritual, results in an ultimate success and beauty. What is more important is that God gives glad tidings that individuals working in unity and solidarity for good will receive God's help, support and power. For this reason, God reminds believers 
not to dispute among themselves so as not to lose strength. The verse below makes this point clear:

Disputes, enmity, hatred and anger are the features of immoral conduct inspired by the evil. True Muslims never conduct themselves under the influence of these undesirable feelings; they have fear for God and
 are always modest, friendly, thoughtful and full of love in their relations. People who are not sincere in their cause may feel jealous of their closest friends and even of their own brothers and sisters. Each other's success may stir up feelings of envy
 
in their hearts. On the contrary, a true Muslim takes pride in other believers' success, and is happy for them as if it were his own accomplishment, and feels grateful to God for the blessings He has granted believers. Furthermore, he supports them in the
i
r endeavour and offers guidance if necessary. Those lacking such morals, on the other hand, hamper the progress of others. Feelings of rivalry and jealousy spoil the good deeds engaged in to attain the good pleasure of God, and accordingly, ruins any beau
ty or blessings. God's Messenger, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), also drew attention to this point and advised the believers to guard against such bad manners:

\par }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

\i0\f0\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 The service of the truth is like carrying and preserving a great and weighty treasure. Those who carry that trus
t on their shoulders will be happy and grateful whenever powerful hands rush to their aid. Far from being jealous, one should proudly applaud the superior strength, effectiveness and capacity of those who in upright love come forward to offer their help. 
W
hy then look on true brothers and self-sacrificing helpers in a spirit of rivalry, thus losing sincerity? You will be exposed to fearsome accusations in the eyes of the people of misguidance, such as pursuing worldly interest through religion, even though
 
it is something a hundred times lower than you and your belief, earning your livelihood through the knowledge of truth and rivalling others in greed and acquisitiveness. The sole remedy for this disease is to accuse your own soul before others raise these
 charges, and always to take the side of your fellow, not your own soul.8 
\par }{\i0\f0\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

As Bediuzzaman Said Nursi also states, offering one's service towards establishment of the moral values of the Qur'an can be seen as preserving a treasure for the believers; one tha
t is extremely precious. To this invaluable service, everybody must provide his wholehearted support and help. Feeling jealous of another believer who offers his devoted and unwavering support, or considering him as a rival, is unacceptable for a true Mus
lim. A believer should be proud of others' commitment and provide his support.
\par Jealousy is an attribute of the evil alliance. The existence of such an evil trait among individuals collaborating for a righteous end does nothing but diminish the strength of t
he alliance. It is surely the evil alliance that benefits from such detriment. As Bediuzzaman says, the only cure for this illness is not following one's ego and always taking the side of one's fellow.
\par In the Risale-i Nur collection, Bediuzzaman draws a co
mparison between the machinery of a factory and believers. The harmonious and smooth functioning of this machinery is essential for a productive output. A similar harmony is also required in the co-operation among believers. Said Nursi explains that belie
vers should avoid talk which could cause jealousy and bitterness as follows: 
\par }\pard\plain \s25\qj \li454\ri170\sb40\sa40\sl-320\slmult0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin170\lin454\itap0 \i\f38\fs20\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {
\i0\f0\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 This is not to criticize your brothers who are employed in this service of the Qur'an, and not to excite their envy by displaying superior virtues. For just as one of man's hands 
cannot compete with the other, neither can one of his eyes criticize the other, nor his tongue object to his ear, nor his heart see his spirit's faults. Each of his members completes the deficiencies of the others, veils their faults, assists their needs,
 
and helps them out in their duties. Otherwise man's life would be extinguished, his spirit flee, and his body be dispersed. Similarly, the components of machinery in a factory cannot compete with one another in rivalry, take precedence over each other, or
 
dominate each other. They cannot spy out one another's faults and criticize each other, destroy the other's eagerness for work, and cause them to become idle. They rather assist each other's motions with all their capacity in order to achieve the common g
o
al; they march towards the aim of their creation in true solidarity and unity. Should even the slightest aggression or desire to dominate interfere, it would throw the factory into confusion, causing it to be without product or result. Then the factory's 
o
wner would demolish the factory entirely. And so, O Risale-i Nur students and servants of the Qur'an! You and I are members of a collective personality such as that, worthy of the title of 'perfect man.' We are like the components of a factory's machinery
 
which produces eternal happiness within eternal life. We are hands working on a dominical boat which will disembark the Community of Muhammed (PBUH) at the Realm of Peace, the shore of salvation. So we are surely in need of solidarity and true union, obta
ined through gaining sincerity -for the mystery of sincerity secures through four individuals the moral strength of one thousand one hundred and eleven- indeed, we are compelled to obtain it.9 
\par }{\i0\f0\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

As also exemplified here, just as how a factory ensures a time
ly and efficient output only when its machinery works in harmony and does not conflict with itself, so should believers working for a common goal to earn the good pleasure of God exhibit similar harmony. They should strive together without searching for o
n
e another's mistakes and defects. In a world where disbelievers ally themselves against the good, are filled with feelings of hatred and envy for the believers, and oppress the poor, the homeless, women, children, and the elderly, all these oppressed peop
l
e hope for the help of the conscientious. In this case, if wise, sincere, conscientious and honest people use their powers against each other, they may be held accountable for this in the sight of God. It is essential that believers see no limits in impro
ving their alliance, cooperation, friendship, solidarity and affection for another, and never fall into a disagreement which will weaken them. This spirit of believers is best stated in the words of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh):

The ultimate aim of the evil is to stir up enmity among believers, to wreak their unity and weaken them. As the foregoing makes clear, they are known by their efforts in inventing lies and slanderin
g the good, disgracing them and bringing doubt upon their credibility. However, the stance assumed by the good and conscientious will render such efforts of the slanderers and those committed to evil ineffective. That is because, the existence of people w
ho do not take these slanders seriously, turn a deaf ear to them, and state they do not believe in them, will prevent any harm to the wronged and hinder the evil ones from attaining their mischievous goals. 
\par Indeed, we know that the noble wife of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) also became the target of such slanderous accusations. God informs us about the kind of attitude the conscientious people should assume when they hear such slander against a believer:

It is certain that a non-God-fearing person, or someone who has no faith in God, will readily tell lies, concoct slanders, and spread rumours without considering the possible trouble he will inflict on people. That is why, it is
 unreasonable and wrong to trust people who have no fear in their hearts for God, who have weak religious values, and who thus assume that they will not have to give an account of their deeds in the hereafter. For the same reasons, it is wrong to respond 
to their accusations without first verifying their validity. In a verse, God explains what the approach of believers should be in such a situation:

That evil, merciless and
 aggressive people represent the majority, or seem to possess great material wealth, may cause some spiritually weak and ignorant people to develop inaccurate interpretations about them. These people may exaggerate their power and attach more importance t
o
 them than they actually deserve. However, the power of people who are distant from God is short-lived and illusory. God is the actual possessor of all the power and resources and it is He who grants such capabilities to people for a time to test them. No
 man has the power to harm another or to be superior over others merely through his wealth or power. Rather, God grants such potency to test man, though it is all within His grasp. 
\par A man without a strong faith fears cruel people and hesitates to confront t
hem. For this reason, the evil go to great lengths as to please such people and strive to earn their respect. They direct all their talk and behaviour in such a way as to convey the message that they are "on their side", and think that they will earn weal
t
h and power as long as they are under their "wing". Little do they know, however, that such an inclination degrades and dishonours them before God and His sincere servants. It is similar to a man who fears a burglar and thus tries to please him, or someon
e who tries to behave like a murderer because he is afraid of one. 
\par What is important is to become a person valued by God, the One Who is the Creator and Possessor of everything. For this reason, those who fail to grasp the might of God must be told about t
he importance of the fear for God and love for Him. They must be told that the evil are actually weak and unable to accomplish anything unless by the Will of God. 
\par In a verse, God informs us of the fact that the good should only have fear for Him and only keep company with those who observe His limits:

A devout person only fears God and has a good grasp of the fact that 
God is the possessor of all power. The only reality these people are concerned with is the Day of Judgement, which they prepare for all their lives. For this reason, it is impossible to threaten such a person with something related to this world, to dishe
a
rten them, or to cause them anxiety, fear, hopelessness and pessimism. That is why, the exuberant energy of such a person never abates, no matter what comes upon him in life. Aware that God is his protector, he turns to Him, Who has infinitive mercy, comp
a
ssion and forgiveness. If he confronts an adversity, a plot, a slander or an unexpected circumstance, he keeps in mind that God is with him, seeing and hearing what the evil are doing. God is the al-Khabir, the one who has knowledge of the most hidden of 
s
ecrets. That is why, none of those events in life, which would generally be deemed disasters by disbelievers, are intimidating or discouraging to believers. Below are some of the verses in which God mentions people of the past who faced every form of affl
iction but stood up to them:

uch a resolute and courageous disposition stems from their deep-felt faith. A great example of the commitment and determination of believers is seen in the answer the Prophet Shu'ayb (as) gave under threat of death:

One of the attributes of Muslims and the conscientious is that they do not discriminate between people because of their sex, culture, social status or any other reason. For instance, one does not have the right to say "You
 are not a believer because you fail to do this..." to someone who clearly maintains that he is a Muslim. No prejudice is held against a person who says he believes. In any case, people should always be eager to help when such a person is in need. God com
mands in a verse as follows:

The majority of people actually have a good grasp of what good, righteous and conscientious conduct is. For this reason, when talking to others, one will find that the majo
rity of people usually accept the good and positive and affirm their commitment to side with the good. However, when it is time to act, most of them remain silent and passive. Although they encounter many situations for which they could side with the good
 and defend them, they remain ambivalent. 
\par There are many reasons for this silence. Fear of material loss is one of them. For instance, someone defending an innocent person from the alliance of the evil may attract the reaction of the evil and thus, with th
e fear of some material loss, stop defending him. Accordingly, he may be seized by certain concerns; he may fear that his status, career and reputation may be tarnished, or that he be subjected to slander. Paralysed by fear, they may not say or do what th
ey actually know is just.
\par However, these people should be aware of the fact that words only please God when they are turned into action. God informs us about people who promise to engage in good deeds but withdraw when it is time to take action: 
\par }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

For this reason everyone who has faith in God, who is aware that he will give an acc

It would be wrong for a person, who witnesses the violence committed against the innocent, recognises the cruelty, mercilessness, immorality, faithlessness around him, and thus feels restless and longs for the establishment of a peaceful and positive envi
ronment, to remain passive. Everyone must invest his best effort to spread the moral values of the Qur'an, which is the only way to resolve problems originating from evil, and strive for good and righteousness. 
\par However, Satan certainly aims to gain control
 over every person who devotes himself to goodness and weaken his resolve. One method Satan employs to discourage a person striving for the good is to make him belittle his efforts and say "What difference would my efforts make?" Faced with all the evil, 
c
ruelty, wars and massacres taking place in all corners of the world, a person may feel himself to be feeble and impotent. However, the fact of the matter is quite otherwise. First of all, neither an individual, nor a society, or any other power can bring 
p
eace, security, tolerance, love, compassion, friendship and understanding to the world. The One who will establish this blissful environment is our Lord, who has power over all things, who possesses endless might, and who knows what is inside our hearts, 
and the substance of our thoughts and words. 
\par We, on the other hand, should strive for the good solely as a demonstration of our true and sincere intentions and our service to God, and as a way to earn the rewards of God. A sincere word from someone, a plea
sing manner in another, or the patience and commitment one displays, may well set an example for others, make them feel closer to the morality of the Qur'an, and eventually become a propelling force in increasing the number of the good. Ultimately, God wi
ll give strength to the good and turn this world into a happy one. Therefore, saying "Would my efforts be of any help?" is only a temptation from Satan, and lending an ear to this temptation is simply a way of avoiding one's responsibility. 
\par As long as one 
is determined to do what is right and remain conscientious, there are great things that can be accomplished for the cause of good. For example, let us assume that there is a very heavy weight to carry. If only 4 people among 15 commit themselves to carry 
t
his weight while the others stand aside because they think "they are too weak to carry the weight", it would not be a wise assertion. However, when 15 of them take on the responsibility and do their best to carry the weight, it would surely lessen the bur
den of the first 4. What really matters is not "Who does what, to which extent" but to what extent one exerts his own strength. 
\par In a verse of the Qur'an, God informs us that He does "not impose on anyone more than he can stand". For a good person, there is always an easier way of doing things:

In our day, the world is forced to witness unprecedented violence, terror, oppression, fraud, imposture, deceit, immorality, fighting, bickering, poverty and hunger. It is obvious that these evil-

This is a heavy responsibility upon the believers, each of whom must strictly avoid contributing to such ev

As we have discussed earlier, fear of the reactions of the evil
 may lead to indifference to unjust practises. However, this is not the attitude assumed by people of conscience. This attitude is typical of those who are blindly addicted to this world and who chase after short-lived worldly interests. 
\par Those who are hes
itant to join the side of the good need to know that their silence and indifference will add to the corruption experienced today all over the world. For instance, if the poor and innocent are massacred in one corner of the world, and the people who claim 
t
o be good keep silent and watch it from a distance, they would actually be on the side of the cruel ones. Those who remain silent for fear of the cruelty and possible harm of the evil cannot hope to be rewarded in the hereafter as those who displayed pati
ence. 
\par \tab For example, the people of the Prophet Moses (as) and his brother the prophet Aaron (as) abandoned them to their enemies. Only because of their fear of disbelievers, they became so insensitive that they deserted a man who devoted all his life to the
 way of God, put his life into jeopardy to save the oppressed, left behind an opulent life in the Pharaoh's palace, strove for the good pleasure of God, and stood bravely against the most cruel man in history. Furthermore, the Prophet Moses (as) and the p
r
ophet Aaron (as) were men of courage and faith who resisted all this calamity and hardship only to save their people from the cruelty of the Pharaoh and the torment in hell. The contemptible and cowardly attitude of the people of the Prophet Moses (as) is
 revealed in the Qur'an as follows:

Two men among those who were afraid, but whom God had blessed, said, 'Enter the gate against them! Once you have entered it, you will be victorious. Put your trust in God if you are believers.' They said, 'We will never 
enter it, Moses, as long as they are there. So you and your Lord go and fight. We will stay sitting here.' He said, 'My Lord, I have no control over anyone but myself and my brother, so make a clear distinction between us and this deviant people.' (Surat

One point deserves special mention here; the sincere and true believers striving for the way of God receive His support, whether they are alone or not. This is the promise of God to believers. God makes this clear in the following verse:

This being the case, taking every opportunity to support the alliance of the good with one's best effort is vitally important to attain a blissful afterlife f

do nothing when they are oppressed, will say "Weren't we with you?", when the good will attain felicity and when their rightness will be made clear to everyone:

In such a circumstance, impartiality would not be an acceptable attitude. On the contrary, as mentioned in the verses above, it is a trait peculiar to hypocrites. 
\par In the face of such cruelty, everyone claiming t
o be among the good must give all the support they can offer. In this regard, they should first make clear with which party they side. That is because dubious is the sincerity of a person who remains silent about cruelty and fails to lend himself to the o
ppressed. As stressed numerous times earlier in this book, supporting the evil ones is not necessarily being side by side with them. Remaining indifferent to them serves the very same purpose. God warns man in the Qur'an thus: }{
\b\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 "And incline not to those who do wrong, or the Fire will seize you." (Surah Hud: 113)}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 
 Being silent is another form of supporting cruelty. In his works, Bediuzzaman Said Nursi describes this situation as follows:
\par }{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

\par The consent given to oppression is no different than oppression; anyone who sides with the oppressor is an oppressor. Anyone who tends to oppression is subjected to the verse "Do not incline to those who do wrong".15 
\par }{\i0\f0\fs22\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid10357149\charrsid6891576

Therefore, if a man is really a conscientious person, then he should resolutely associate himself with the honest and the good. A contrary attitude would imply being on the side of the evil. If someo
ne does not inform the police about a thief, we cannot call him impartial. This man clearly supports the burglar. Alternatively, watching someone who commits cruelty and turning one's back to evil, saying, "If I try to prevent him, he may also harm me" is
 
simply support of the oppressor. Besides, we must remember that one day one's own house can also be broken by this same thief, or one may be subjected to the same cruelty by the same oppressor. In this sense, the virtuous thing to do is to involve oneself
 
in a concerted effort to prevent the cruelty of such a person even though he does not threaten personal harm. Otherwise, willingly or not, one would be co-operating with the evil. God gives an account of the people on the Day of Judgement who take sides w
ith the good and who take sides with the evil.

All through the book we have discussed that the evil has been in an all-out effort to form an alliance against the good. In another section of t
his book, we stated that the good should act in unity against the ones devising wicked plots. It was further stated that the strength resulting from the unity of the good will ultimately remove all wickedness on earth. 
\par This is what God has promised in the
 Qur'an. God gives the glad tidings of another fact: the plots and evil plans of the wicked are born to fail no matter how powerful and threatening they might seem. Even within the moment they think they are causing the most distress to believers, they fa

The purpose of this book is to make a call the good, conscientious, honest, sincere, optimistic, genial, modest, loyal, faithful, chaste, sel
f-sacrificing, forgiving, agreeable, humble and peaceful people. These wise and sensible people would surely like to hear the exchange of kind words and live in a peaceful and amicable environment where people love and respect one another. 
\par However, we are
 surrounded by wicked, unscrupulous, pessimistic, insincere, deceiving, selfish, ungrateful, disrespectful, vindictive, unchaste, quarrelsome, bad-tempered, fractious people whose hearts are full of hatred. The number of such people is by no means negligi
b
le. Guided by the evil, these people endeavour to spread their wicked ways to all people. Against the alliance of evil, which has become extremely strong and harmful in our day, the good should initiate an all-out resistance, without losing any time gropi
n
g for the proper conditions, and bothering about what others are saying. In their endeavour, they should be prepared for all the hardship they are likely to face, join forces together with the zeal they derive from their faith, and resist evil with all th
e power they have.
\par Today is not the time to look for the mistakes of others or to to look down on others due to their inadequacies. On the contrary, everyone who calls himself a "Muslim" and says "I am a conscientious and good person" should come together a
nd avoid all forms of conduct which would strengthen and encourage the evil. 
\par Postponing the formation of this alliance, or waiting for others to take the initiative, is simply abandoning the oppressed to the cruelty of the evil. 
\par All conscientious people 
should do their best to live in a world where people approach one another with an amicable and friendly manner, and correct one another's errors with kindness, and where peace, compassion, tolerance, happiness and abundance, in short, where the moral valu
e
s of the Qur'an pervade. If we conduct ourselves with these principles in mind, our Lord, having infinitive mercy and compassion, will grant us bliss. For this reason, everyone must ally themselves to those who have devoted their entire lives to goodness.
 We must also remember, that in Surat as-Saff, verse 4, God commands Muslims to be like }{\b\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 "well-built walls."}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576

In this book, we have examined nature, plants and the miracle of creation in plants. All these have led us to the
 conclusion that plants could not have come into being by chance. On the contrary, every detail we have studied in this book points to a superior creation. By contrast, materialism, which seeks to deny the fact of creation in the universe, is nothing but 
an unscientific fallacy. 
\par Once materialism is invalidated, all other theories based on this philosophy are rendered baseless. Foremost of them is Darwinism, that is, the theory of evolution. This theory, which argues that life originated from inanimate matt
er through coincidences, has been demolished with the recognition that the universe was created by God. American astrophysicist Hugh Ross explains this as follows:

It is God Who created the universe and Who designed it down to its smallest detail. Therefore, it is impossible for the theory of evolution, which holds that living beings are not created by God, but are products of coincidences, to be true.
\par Unsurprisingly
, when we look at the theory of evolution, we see that this theory is denounced by scientific findings. The design in life is extremely complex and striking. In the inanimate world, for instance, we can explore how sensitive are the balances which atoms r
est upon, and further, in the animate world, we can observe in what complex designs these atoms were brought together, and how extraordinary are the mechanisms and structures such as proteins, enzymes, and cells, which are manufactured with them.
\par This extraordinary design in life invalidated Darwinism at the end of the 20th century. 
\par We have dealt with this subject in great detail in some of our other studies, and shall continue to do so. However, we think that, considering its importance, it will be helpful to make a short summary here as well.

Although a doctrine going back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the 19th century. The most important development that made the theory the top topic of the world of science was the book by Charles Darwin titled 
}{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 The Origin of Species}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 
 published in 1859. In this book, Darwin denied that different living species on the earth were created separately by God. According to Darwin, all living beings had a common ancestor and they diversified over time through small changes. 
\par Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an "assumption." Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his 
book titled "Difficulties of the Theory," the theory was failing in the face of many critical questions. 
\par Darwin invested all his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve the "Difficulties of the Theory." However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. 
\par The defeat of Darwinism against science can be reviewed under three basic topics:
\par 1) The theory can by no means explain how life originated on the earth. 
\par 2) There is no scientific finding showing that the "evolutionary mechanisms" proposed by the theory have any power to evolve at all. 
\par 3) The fossil record proves completely the contrary of the suggestions of the theory of evolution.
\par In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines:

The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell cou
ld generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, of the first step of the al
leged evolutionary process it has to be inquired: How did this "first cell" originate?
\par Since the theory of evolution denies creation and does not accept any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the "first cell" originated coincidentally with
in the laws of nature, without any design, plan, or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. This, however, is a claim inconsistent with even the most unassailable rules of biolog
y.

In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, 
the theory asserting that non-living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prov
e this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. 
\par Similarly, worms developing in meat was assumed to be evidence of spontaneous generation. However, only some time later was
 it understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. 
\par Even in the period when Darwin wrote }{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 The Origin of Species}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 , the belief that bacteria could come into existen
ce from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. 
\par However, five years after Darwin's book was published, the discovery of Louis Pasteur disproved this belief, which constituted the groundwork of evolution. Pasteur summarized the conclusion he reached after time-consuming studies and experiments: }{
\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 "The claim that inanimate matter can originate life is buried in history for good."}{\f0\fs18\up6\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 17}{

ng being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse.

The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the 20th century was the renowned Russian b
iologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930's, he tried to prove that the cell of a living being could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: "U
nfortunately, the origin of the cell remains a question which is actually the darkest point of the entire evolution theory."}{\f0\fs18\up6\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 18}{

ecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins.

The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a big impasse about the origin of life is that even the living organisms deemed the simplest have incred
ibly complex structures. The cell of a living being is more complex than all of the technological products produced by man. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing inorganic materials toget
her.

\par The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of the cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. It is calculated that if the information coded in DNA were written down, this would make a giant library consisting of 900 volum
es of encyclopaedias of 500 pages each.
\par A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: the DNA can only replicate with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can only be realized by the information coded 
in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, Californ
ia, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the }{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 Scientific American}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576  magazine:

The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of "natural selection". The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: }{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576

 cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. 
\par Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book }{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 The Origin of Species:

So, how could these "favourable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science in his age. According to the French biologist Lamarck, who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed o
n
 the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation and these traits, accumulating from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, according to Lamarck, giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled t
o eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par Darwin also gave similar examples, and in his book }{\i\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 The Origin of Species}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576

In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the "Modern Synthetic Theory", or as it is more commonly known, Neo-Darwinism, at
 the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings because of external factors such as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favourable variations" in addition to natural mutation.
 
\par Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings present on the earth formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms such as the ears, eyes, l
ungs, and wings, underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they always cause harm to them. 
\par The reason for this is very simple: the DNA has a very complex structure and random effects can only cause harm to it. American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

y is that they will be ineffectual. These four characteristics of mutations imply that mutations cannot lead to an evolutionary development. A random change in a highly specialised organism is either ineffectual or harmful. A random change in a watch cann
ot improve the watch. It will most probably harm it or at best be ineffectual. An earthquake does not improve the city, it brings destruction.}{\i0\f0\fs18\up6\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576 25

Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code,
 has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an "evolutionary mechanism," is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living beings, and leaves them disabled. (The most common e
f
fect of mutation on human beings is cancer). No doubt, a destructive mechanism cannot be an "evolutionary mechanism." Natural selection, on the other hand, "can do nothing by itself" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no "evolutiona
ry mechanism" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, neither could any imaginary process called evolution have taken place.

The clearest evidence that the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. 
\par According to the theory of evolution, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else in time and all species have come into being in this way. 
According to the theory, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. 
\par Had this been the case, then numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. 
\par For instance, some half-fish/half-rep
tiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some reptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the reptilian traits they already
 had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as "transitional forms." 
\par If such animals had really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the remains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil record. In }{

However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the 19th century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All the fossils unearthed in excavations showed 
that, contrary to the expectations of evolutionists, life appeared on earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. 
\par A famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist:

that is, depending on concrete data\endash fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological 
sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most "unscientific," are "extra-sensory perception"\endash concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense\endash 
and finally "human evolution." Zuckerman explains his reasoning:

Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly a
nswer the question of "how we see". Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the retina of the eye. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and they reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain called the centre of v
ision. These electric signals are perceived in this centre of the brain as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par The brain is insulated from light. That means that the inside of the brain is solid dar
k, and light does not reach the location where the brain is situated. The place called the centre of vision is a solid dark place where no light ever reaches; it may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright wo
rld in this pitch darkness.
\par The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the 20th century has not been able to attain it. For instance, look at the book you read, your hands with which you hold it, then lift your head and
 look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a t
h
ree-dimensional, coloured, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for 
t
his purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dim
ensional perspective having depth. 
\par For many years, ten of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV, and reach the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system but it is not possible to watch i
t without putting on glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both 
the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of c
hance, that all its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been f
ormed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear;
 the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them; the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalises in the centre of hearing in the brain. 

\par The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just like it is from light: it does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the }{
\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid6891576\charrsid6891576 outside;}{\f0\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid8277579\charrsid6891576  the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, t
he sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your brain, which is insulated from sound, you listen to the symphonies of an orchestra, and hear all the noises in a crowded place. However, if the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise devi
ce at that moment, it would be seen that a complete silence is prevailing there. 
\par As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sou
nd recorders, high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavour, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as t
h
e sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality HI-FI systems produced by the biggest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a HI-FI you always hear a hissing sound b
e
fore the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the technology of the human body are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does HI-FI; it perceives sound e
xactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par So far, no visual or recording apparatus produced by man has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. 
\par However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater fact lies beyond all this.

Who is it that watches an alluring world in its brain, listens to symphonies and the twittering of birds, and smells the rose?
\par The stimulations coming from the eyes, ears, and nose of a human being travel to the brain as electro-chemical nervous impulses. 
In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact about this subject: Who is it that perceives these electro-chemical nervous impu
l
ses as images, sounds, odours and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for eye, ear, and nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? There is no doubt that this consciousness
 does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot give any answer to these questions. 
\par For this consciousness is the spirit created by God. The spirit needs neither the eye to watch the images, nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, nor does it need the brain to think. 
\par Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should ponder on Almighty God, should fear Him and seek re
fuge in Him, He Who squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeters in a three-dimensional, coloured, shadowy, and luminous form.

The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evol
ution is a claim evidently at variance with scientific findings. The theory's claim on the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the intermediate forms
 
required by the theory never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas such as the earth-centered universe model have been taken out of the agenda of science throu
ghout history. 
\par However, the theory of evolution is pressingly kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against the theory as an "attack on science." Why?
\par The reason is that the theory of evolution is an indispens
able dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward for the workings of nature.
\par Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is "first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist":

These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to the materialist philosophy. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life.
 
It insists that millions of different living species; for instance, birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales and human beings originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as the pouring rain, the lightning flash, et
c., out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to reason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as "not to allow a Divine Foot in the door."
\par Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudic
e will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise and All-Knowing. This Creator is God, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living 
beings.
