Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid clai
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 His pen-name is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Yahya (John), in memory of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It represents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunn
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the "last word," so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ho attained ultimate wisdom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as God's \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Existence and Unity and the hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and perverted ideologies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Some of his books are available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 instrumental in many people recovering faith in God and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consid
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefutability. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
entimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for God's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Those who encourage others to read these\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of God, render an invaluable service. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books that create confusion in people's minds, lead them \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
into ideological chaos, and that clearly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the n
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Yahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ervice are manifested in the readers' conviction. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, conflict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological prevalence of disbelief. This can be ende
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, cl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 arly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of God, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

This and all the other books by the author can be read individually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their reflections and experiences to one another. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In addition\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of God. The author's books are all extremely convincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to others, one of the

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. This rich source material on faith-related issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In thes\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Imagine that the English branch of this company informs the head office in America of the demand trends of consumers in England; the management in America, taking account of the latest consumer expectations, sends a directive to the research and develop
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ment department in Italy; the prototypes designed in Italy are submitted for public approval back in England. The prototypes that gain approval are produced in the Chinese factories of this international company, and a huge world wide advertising campaign
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is organized to introduce these new products . . . 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The organization outlined above must have highly-ordered communication at every level. Administrators, engineers, workers, advertisers, marketing officials and many others must be in constant cooperation 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 with one another. Success depends directly on communication. Otherwise, this company could not survive in today's rapidly changing and developing environment.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, imagine a much larger organization. The number of people that belong to this organization is\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 far greater. Suppose that everyone in the world, about 6 billion people, works for this organization. Everyone has his own special job. Hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of people gather under the same roof to perform a common task. There is such
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
a tight web of administration and information that every one of these 6 billion people is informed individually by means of a cellular phone as to what he or she has to do. For example, if one of these people is employed in a factory, he may sometimes be 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
old to increase the speed of production, sometimes to slow it down, and sometimes to alter the product. Finally, imagine that an organized plan and communications system exist so that millions of people throughout the hundreds of thousands of different lo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ations all over the world work according to this common plan.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let's enlarge our example a little. Imagine that the population of the world is much greater than it is at present, but that our organization functions even more efficiently.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Suppose that t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he population is fifteen thousand times greater than it is today, that there are fifteen thousand other planets like this Earth and that the 6 billion people crowded onto each planet make up a total of 100 trillion people. Further suppose that this collec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion of human beings works together in perfect harmony, each individual being informed by cellular phone as to what he has to do.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This example is beyond our power to conceive, but is actually a simplified description of an existing organization, which opera\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tes every second throughout the whole world among the approximately 100 trillion cells that make up the human body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As you are reading this, millions of operations are happening in your body. In these operations there is a calculation of the needs of every\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 cell in every part of the body, and a determination of what function each cell must perform; measures are taken to respond to the requirements of the cells and each cell is informed individually as to what it must do.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, what allows you to read \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this book are your eye cells, and to nourish them, glucose is required. To respond to those needs, a system was established in your body that calculates how much sugar there is in your blood and that keeps the amount stable. There is a great plan, organiz
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d by the web of communication among the cells, that calculates how many times a minute your heart must beat, the level of calcium stored in your body, the amount of blood your kidneys filter and thousands of other such details. This system of chemical com
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 unication that ensures that the 100 trillion cells work in harmony with one another is called the hormone system.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hormone system, together with the nervous system, ensures the coordination of the cells of the body. If we compare the nervous system to m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
essages sent over the Internet, the hormone system can be compared to a letter sent by post: it is slower, but its effect lasts longer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When we examine these systems that control the body, a fact becomes clear that most people are not aware of. Most people\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 are convinced that they themselves control the direction of their lives. If you asked someone, "How much of your body do you control?" he would surely say, "All of it." But this answer contradicts the scientific facts.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A person is in control of a very lim\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ited part of his body, and even of that part his control is only partial. For example, he can use his body to walk, or to speak or he can use his hands to work, but deep within his body there are thousands of chemical and physical operations going on with
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ut his knowing about or willing them. Anyone who thinks that he is completely in charge of his own body (or his own life) is greatly mistaken.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another fact we will see when we examine the perfect communication system described in this book is this: An orga\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nism cannot possibly be formed by lifeless matter, on its own and by chance. Darwinists and materialists do not believe in God; they believe that ultimately living things were formed spontaneously and by chance out of lifeless matter. However, in the twen
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ieth century thousands of discoveries were made concerning cells and the systems contained in them. It is now known that cells have a highly complex design. The communication between hormones and cells alone is enough to show what an extraordinary system 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 xists in cells, and that they could not have been formed by chance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This book has two aims: First, to show (with the support of scientific evidence)}{\f0\fs22\insrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Darwinists and materialists who make chance their god that their philosophy is illogical and untenable. Sec\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ond, to once again show those who believe in God, examples of the excellence of His creation, so that they may see the glory, power and sublimity of our Lord and exalt Him for His excellent works.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the pages that follow, we shall examine the hormone syst\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
em that controls the human body for the benefit of the human being and that is a manifestation of the wonder of creation, and we shall witness together the creative art of God.

e fact that you are able to sit comfortably in your chair and read these sentences is due to systems that organize the internal balance of your body for your benefit. For example, no matter what the temperature outside, your body must always be kept at
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a constant temperature, usually between 36.5 and 37.5 degrees. A sudden fall or rise in body temperature may result in death. The body temperature of a healthy individual, thanks to these systems, will vary at most 0.5 of a degree. In the same way, the p
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 essure of the blood in the veins, the amount of fluid in the blood, and the speed at which the cells function must be delicately measured, and the existing balance safeguarded at every moment. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us imagine the efforts needed to artificially ensure these\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 balances. First, imagine that there exist delicate thermometers in a few places in the body, special devices to measure the density of the blood in the veins, and mini laboratories to control the rate of speed at which the cells function. Then, imagine t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at all these thousands of tiny devices located in every point in the body must make the right assessments every second and transmit the information they receive to a highly advanced computer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, it is not enough that these assessments are made alone;\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 at the same time, it is also necessary to know, according to the available data, which actions must be taken and what kind of command must be given to which cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Of course, even with the state of today's technology, it is still impossible to place thous\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ands of thermometers, a mini laboratory, and pressure measuring devices in the depths of the human body. Yet a special system with the finest possible design has been placed from birth deep in the human body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thousands of different receivers measure such t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hings as the body's temperature and the pressure in the blood vessels. Then they send this information to a very special computer. This computer is the area of the brain called the hypothalamus.

mus is the general director of the hormone system; it has the vital task of ensuring the internal stability of the human body. At every moment, the hypothalamus assesses messages coming to it from the brain and the depths of the body. Afterwards, it perfo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ms a number of functions, such as maintaining a stable body temperature, controlling blood pressure, ensuring a fluid balance, and even proper sleep patterns.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hypothalamus is located directly under the brain and is the size of a hazel nut. A considerab\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
le amount of information relative to the body state is sent to the hypothalamus. Information is transmitted to it from every point in the body, including the sense centers in the brain. It then analyses the information it has received, decides what measur
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s are to be taken, what changes must be made in the body, and causes the appropriate cells of the body to carry out its decisions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The basic point that must be noticed here is this: the hypothalamus is an organ composed of unconscious cells. A cell does no\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t know how long a human being needs to sleep; it cannot calculate what the body's temperature should be. It cannot make the best decision based on the information at hand, and it cannot make another cell in a far removed area of the body carry out this de
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ision. Yet the cells in the hypothalamus act in an extraordinarily conscious manner to ensure that the necessary balances in the body are maintained. In the pages that follow, we shall examine in detail the remarkable activities displayed by these unconsc
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ous cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to form a bridge between the hormonal system and the other system that controls and oversees the body\hich\f0 \emdash \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the nervous system. The hypothalamus not only directs the hormonal system, but also the nervous system with a high degree of expertise.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hypothalamus has a very important assistant in its role of governing the body; this assistant informs the appropriat\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e body areas of the decisions that have been taken. For example, when there is a drop in blood pressure, bits of information are set into motion, and these inform the hypothalamus of the change in pressure; then the hypothalamus decides what measures must
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 be taken to raise it and informs its assistant of its decision.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to effect the decision, the helper knows which cells must receive the command. It writes messages in a language that these cells can understand and transmits them immediately. The cel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ls obey the command they have received and take the appropriate action to raise the blood pressure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This assistant to the hypothalamus is the pituitary gland, which also has a very important influence on the hormonal system.
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Between the hypothalamus and th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e pituitary gland there is a marvelous system of communication. These two pieces of flesh actually communicate like two conscious human beings. The hypothalamus has complete control over the pituitary gland and its vital secretion of several hormones.

\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
example, the hypothalamus of a growing child sends a message to the pituitary gland with the command, "secrete the growth hormone" and the pituitary gland then secretes the growth hormone exactly as needed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Something similar happens when the cells of the b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ody need to work faster; this time there is a two-stage chain of command. The hypothalamus sends an order to the pituitary gland which, in turn, sends the order to the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland secretes the proper amount of thyroid hormone and the 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ells of the body begin to work faster.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the adrenal glands (which produce several very important hormones) must be activated or the reproductive organs must produce their hormones, the hypothalamus again sends a message to the pituitary gland, which di
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rects it to the relevant areas and ensures the required hormones in those areas are secreted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hormones produced by the hypothalamus to direct the pituitary gland include:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Growth hormone-releasing hormone 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thyrotropin-releasing hormone
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Corticotropin-rel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 easing hormone
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In some cases the hypothalamus, in order to intervene in the activity of the cells, uses two hormones that it has secreted itself. To store these hormones, it first sends them to the pituitary gland, then, wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 en required, it ensures that they are secreted by the pituitary gland. These hormones are:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These two hormone molecules produced by the hypothalamus are very small. One of them is only\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 three amino acids large. The hypothalamus hormones are distinguished from other hormones not only by being small; they also differ from other hormones by the distance they cover in the body. Hormones generally travel a long distance from the hormonal gla

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This pea-sized pituitary gland has such a great influence on the human body an\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d performs such wonderful functions that it has been the subject of scientific enquiry for years (and still is). This small piece of flesh has won much respect in the scientific world. The pituitary gland has also earned some admiration because of its ext
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aordinary characteristics. For example, the pituitary gland has been called "the conductor of the endocrine (hormone) orchestra." This gland has also been complimented as "the master gland." At the same time, the pituitary gland has been described as an "
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 xtraordinary biological wonder."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The pituitary gland deserves these compliments because of the twelve different hormones it produces and the control it exercises over the hormonal system. This gland not only produces hormones that affect particular tissue 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cells, but also organizes the work of other hormonal glands far distant from it.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If we recall that the hormonal glands are organs that organize the activities of the cells in the body by giving them certain commands, the importance of the pituitary gland b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecomes all the more apparent. Since the pituitary gland does not stop at giving orders to many cells in the body, it also gives commands to hormonal glands that themselves transmit orders to other cells in the body. In this sense, it functions as a direct
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r of directors.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
For example, it sends a command to the thyroid gland when conditions require the secretion of the thyroid hormone. In the same way, it issues commands to the adrenal glands, to the testes in the male body, and to the ovaries and the milk gl
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ands in the female body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 An important question is: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How do the pituitary gland and the cells which form it know "the function of the adrenal gland," how "it performs its function" and "the sign required to activate it?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How do the cells that constitute th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e adrenal gland understand and interpret the command sent to them from the pituitary gland, and why do they obey it?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When we consider the details of the matter, we see that the dimensions of this wonder become even wider. A hormone produced by the pituitar\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
y gland is designed to fit on the binding site of the targeted cell. However, no pituitary cell has ever seen the hormonal gland to which a message has been sent. The pituitary cells cannot know the design of the receptors on the cells that compose the ad
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
enal gland. This can be compared to a person who sets out on a journey to a house thousands of kilometers away in another country, who finds himself in front of a door he has never seen, yet has a key that fits the lock at the first try. How do the cells 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 hat make up the pituitary gland know how to make the key that fits these locks that they have never seen?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important point is that there is no room for error in this system. If the key produced cannot open the targeted door (that is, if the hormone \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
produced does not perform its function in the designated area), death is the result. For example, if the hormone produced by the pituitary gland does not operate on the adrenal gland, the body cannot survive.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to understand more fully what a great \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
wonder this system is, we may use the following method: Stand in front of a mirror, place your finger at the point between your two eyes. Five to six centimeters behind this point, right inside your skull, is the piece of flesh, the size of a chickpea, wh
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ch we call the pituitary gland.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Then, place your other hand on your belly. Just under this hand within the belly area are your kidneys. On top of each kidney there is a gland the size of a walnut weighing about 4-5 grams called the adrenal gland.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These two\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 pieces of flesh can communicate between themselves. They are not two conscious human beings conversing with one another, but two groups of cells. Furthermore, this communication system, together with the effects it produces, is the result of an advanced 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 echnology that even human beings do not possess.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that two pieces of flesh deep within our body communicate with and understand one another is a wonder to contemplate.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 On the other hand, if a person has not studied biology, he is unaware that such \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
an organ exists in his skull just below his brain. Most laymen do not even know that the pituitary gland is a tiny piece of flesh below the brain which keeps us alive by constantly sending messages and ordering commands to the body. Moreover, this person 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s totally unaware that all these things are happening. If this gland did not perform its function, this person would die after a short time. If you were to look for a moment from this point of view at the person next to you, you would be able to understan
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  more clearly how helpless and dependent human beings are before God, our Creator.

A one-year old baby is about twice as heavy and 50% as long as on the day he was born. In one year, he gains weight at an amazing rate. He also grows longer, and his body grows in proportion. What causes a newly born baby who weighs three kilograms and is
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 50 centimeters long at birth to become a fully grown adult weighing 80 kilograms and measuring 1.80 meters twenty years later?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The answer to this question is hidden in the growth hormone found in an amazing molecule secreted by the pituitary gland.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In orde\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r for a baby to become an adult, he must grow. The growing process happens in two different ways. Some cells increase their bulk; other cells divide and multiply. What directs and ensures these two processes is the growth hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The growth hormone is sec\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reted from the pituitary gland and affects all of the cells of the body. Every cell knows the meaning of the message sent to it from the pituitary gland. In compliance with this message, it grows or multiplies. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, the heart of a newly born baby \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is about one-sixteenth the size of an adult heart, yet the total }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 number}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of cells in the baby's heart is the same as that in the adult heart. As the body develops, the growth hormone affects the heart cells individually. Every cell develops according to the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  command given to it by the growth hormone. As a result, the heart grows and becomes an adult heart.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The multiplication of the nerve cells stops when the baby is six months old and still lives inside the mother's womb. From this time until birth and from b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 irth to adulthood, the }{
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 number}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of nerve cells remains constant. The growth hormone commands the nerve cells to increase in }{
\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 size}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 . When the period of growth of the nervous system has come to an end, it has reached its final form.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Other cells in the body (for \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
example, muscle and bone cells) divide and multiply throughout their period of development. Again, it is the growth hormone that informs the cells how much they must divide.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the light of these circumstances we must ask this question:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How is it that the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pituitary gland knows the correct formula according to which the cells must divide and grow? It is amazing that this piece of flesh, the size of a chickpea, controls all the cells of the body and causes them to grow by dividing or increasing their bulk. A
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 other question that must be asked is: who charged this piece of flesh with this function? Why do these cells throughout their lifetime send messages commanding other cells to divide?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here again we see the flawless excellence of God's creation. Cells locate\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d in one small area ensure the orderly division of trillions of other cells. However, it is impossible for these cells to observe the human body from outside to determine how much the body must grow and at which stage it must stop growing. These unconscio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s cells, in the darkness of the body, without even knowing what they are doing, produce the growth hormone (and cease producing it) when necessary. A perfect system has been created that controls every stage of growth and secretion of this hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nother wonder that the growth hormones command some cells to increase in size and others to multiply by cell division because the hormones that reach each kind of cell are identical to each other. How the cell that receives the command must react is writt
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n in its genetic code. The growth hormone issues the command to grow; }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 how}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  that growth will occur is recorded in the cell. This shows the power and magnificence of creation at every point in the development of the human body. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet another very important poi\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nt is the fact that the growth hormone affects most body cells. If some cells obeyed the growth hormones and others did not, the result would be a disaster. For example, if the heart cells obeyed the commands of the growth hormone but the cells in the rib
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 cage refused to multiply and grow, what would happen? The growing heart would be squeezed in the undersized chest cavity and die.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Or if the bone of the nose grew but the skin on it stopped growing, the bone of the nose would tear the skin and become expose\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d. The harmonious growth of muscles, bones, skin and other organs is ensured by the obedience of each individual cell to the growth hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The growth hormone also gives the command for the development of cartilage at the ends of the bones.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  This cartilag\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e is like the unformed shape of a newly born baby; if it does not grow, the baby cannot grow. The cells in this area cause the bone to grow lengthwise but how do they know that the bone must grow in this way? If this bone grew sideways, the leg would not

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So, for this reason a very special system for regulating the amount of this hormone secreted in the body has been created. The amount of this hormone secreted is determined by \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the hypothalamus, which is recognized as the director of the pituitary gland. When it is time for the growth hormone to be secreted, it sends the "growth hormone-releasing hormone" (GHRH) to the pituitary gland. And when too much growth hormone has been r
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 leased into the blood, the hypothalamus sends a message (the somatostatin hormone) to the pituitary gland and slows down the secretion of the growth hormone.}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Yet how do the cells that compose the hypothalamus know how much growth hormone there should be i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n the blood? How do they measure the amount of growth hormone in the blood and made a decision based on this amount? In order to explain just how great a wonder this is, let us consider an example:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us imagine that we have used a special device and redu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ced a person to several millionths of his original size, that is, to the size of a human cell. We have put him in a special capsule beside one of the cells in the region of the hypothalamus.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The job of this person is to count the number of growth hormone m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
olecules in the capillaries passing in front of him. He determines if there is a reduction or an increase in the number of these molecules. It is well known that there are thousands of different materials contained in the blood. It is impossible for a hum
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n being (if he is not an expert in the field) to know from the molecular structure if something in front of him is a growth hormone or something else. But the person we placed in the hypothalamus must recognize with certainty the growth hormones among mil
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ions of other molecules. Moreover, he must check the amount of the hormone at all times.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How can the unconscious hypothalamus accomplish this task, which seems very difficult even for a human being? How does it measure at every moment the amount of growth \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hormone in the blood? How does it distinguish the growth hormone from other molecules? These cells do not have eyes to recognize molecules, or brains to evaluate a situation. But they put into effect the commands given to them in perfect a system that God
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 has created. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The growth hormone is not only secreted in the developmental period but also continues in adulthood. Under these circumstances you would expect that people would continue to grow and become gigantic. But this does not occur.}{

 When a person reaches a particular size, his cells do not continue to divide and grow. Scientists still do not know why this happens. It is known that thanks to a very special system, cells are programmed not to divide and grow any more after a certain t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 me. Given this situation, a person should think about the Power that created this perfect program. This shows us another wonder of God's creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is not very difficult to understand how important it is that trillions of cells stop dividing and growing \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
together at the correct time. If some of these cells did not stop dividing as others did, the result would be terrible. For example, if the eye cells continued to divide and multiply after the other cell groups have ceased to do so, the eye would be squee
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 z\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed in its socket and burst.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
After speaking about trillions of cells suddenly stopping their activities, there is something else worth remembering. Cancer is a disease that we have been fighting for decades and still have not conquered; it is caused by one 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 single cell continuing to divide out of control. This example permits us to better understand the delicate balance that exists in the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In adulthood, the growth hormone continues to have an influence on a few special cells and stimulates these cells to\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 divide and multiply. This is another wonder of creation that serves a special purpose. This cell division no longer causes the body to grow, but serves to repair and regenerate the body. For example, skin cells and red blood cells continue to divide caus
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng our bodies to gain 200 million new cells every minute.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 5 }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These cells replace old and damaged cells. By this means, the total number of cells remains constant.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The growth hormone has a special design by which it brings several factors into use\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to ensure cell division and growth.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For cell division and growth to occur, it is first necessary that the cells increase in size, which is possible only through an increase in their amount of protein. So, the growth hormone has a special function in accel
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 erating the production of protein in the cell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is known that protein production occurs as the result of a complex process. Scientists have been able to understand only some of the superficial elements in this process after long years of research. In ord
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er to produce one molecule to accelerate the operation of this system, it is necessary to know all aspects of it. The fact that the growth hormone has a design that enables it to speed up the production of protein is a proof that the system that produces 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rotein and the growth hormone are created by God to act in harmony with each other and perform their functions according to His command.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The growth hormone not only ensures the acceleration of the synthesis of protein, but also ensures that the requisite a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mount of raw material enters the cells for this purpose. The main material needed for the synthesis of protein is amino acids, the building blocks of protein. As if they were aware of this information, the growth hormone stimulates the cell membrane so th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t it can receive more amino acids. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to speed up the synthesis of protein, the metabolism of the cell must also be accelerated and, to this end, the growth hormone cooperates with other hormones. The thyroid hormone secreted during the period of gr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 owth accelerates the metabolic activities of the cells.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order for all this to happen, one more very important thing is needed: energy. Even if all the systems we have mentioned so far were perfect, they would be of no use without a source of energy. Wit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hout energy, the growth process could not occur. But the human body has been so perfectly planned that this need too has been provided for. In addition to all these intricate functions, the growth hormone performs one more very important duty. It ensures 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he release of fat molecules to mix with the blood. In this way, each molecule will serve as a source of fuel fulfilling the cell's energy needs.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When reading about the activities of the growth hormone in the body, it is important to recall that what accomp\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lishes this is a lifeless, unconscious molecule formed by the combination of a few atoms that have no hands, eyes, or brain. It is remarkable that a lifeless bit of matter can know when and where to go in the body, and when, how and by what means to stimu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ate it. Unconscious atoms cannot write messages and send them to one another, but this wonderful event happens when some molecules interact with each other. They immediately know what they must do and then do it. For example, when some molecules interact 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ith the growth hormone, they immediately begin to divide. Others decide to take more amino acids. And for this it is only necessary to respond to the growth hormone. How can such a conscious and organized activity continue without interruption in the body
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
To claim that all these wonderful balances came to be in the course of time by the operation of chance flies in the face of scientific fact and logic. This is because only one deficiency could destroy the whole system. In order for a living thing to survi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ve, its whole system and all its organs must come to be at the same time. Everything reviewed so far about the growth hormone and these delicate interrelated balances demonstrates the fact that human beings were created perfectly as a complete organism. C

How does the production of mother's milk begin and how is it controlled? A number of wonders of creation are hidden in the answer to this question. In the production of milk, the hormonal system and the nervous system work in co
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ncert and the production occurs after planning based on an exchange of information. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The hormone that activates the milk glands in the mother's breast, as noted, is the prolactin hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. In the early days of pregnancy, cert\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ain factors suppress the secretion of prolactin. These factors are like a foot pressing on the brake of an automobile going down a hill. The automobile tends to go downhill, but when the brake is applied, it cannot move. The production of milk is hindered
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in the mother.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The hindering of prolactin production is very important because, while the baby is still unborn, the milk production in the mother is not needed. How is this brake applied, and how is premature secretion prevented? Here is a true wonder of d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
esign. The hypothalamus in the brain secretes a hormone that prevents the production of prolactin. This hormone, called PIH (Prolactin Inhibiting Hormone), slows down the production of prolactin or, in other words, applies the brake.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Who decides to apply t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he brake? Estrogen, a hormone produced during pregnancy, ensures that the brake is applied by producing PIH. When the baby is born, the amount of estrogen secreted is reduced, which also reduces the amount of PIH. This is like the foot slowly releasing th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  brake and the car moving down the hill. In this way, the production of prolactin slowly begins and activates the milk glands to produce mother's milk.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here we see a real wonder of creation. Thanks to this design, the prod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uction of milk is prevented during the first months of pregnancy. Consider this whole system carefully:

ances, it is possible for humans to examine the human body more carefully. This possibility shows the degree of intelligence and planning with which the systems in the human body were created and reveals the creative artistry of God.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For those who reject t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he existence of God, there is, as always, only one delusion in which they can take refuge\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 time and chance.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is scientifically impossible that any one of the thousands of different elements in this system, for example,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the breast, the pituitary gland, a nerve or a cell of the hypothalamus or even a single hormone could have come to be by evolution. It is necessary that }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 each}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another proof of creation in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the wonder of mother's milk is the oxytocin hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Above we have described the perfect design that exists for the production of mother's milk. But there is a problem: the production of the milk in the milk glands is not sufficient. With his strength alo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ne, the baby cannot suck the milk from the nipple as easily as from a feeding bottle; the milk must travel from the milk glands to the nipple. Otherwise, the system we have described so far will be useless; the mother's milk will not be able to reach nipp
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e from the milk glands and the newborn baby will not receive any nourishment. So, how is the milk made to reach the nipple and the baby? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The countless numbers of people throughout history who have been fed on mother's milk\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 ourselves included\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 owe a debt to\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  the oxytocin hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This hormone ensures the contraction of the muscles surrounding the milk channels, moves the milk from the milk glands toward the nipple where it is easily accessible to the baby at breast-feeding time. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Very well. How do the cells t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

These are the questions that must be asked by anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the excellence of this system. The conscious intelligence that is manifested in every cell in the human body bears witness to the eter

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If the duty of calculating these numbers were given to each human being, he would be required to devote all his time to this job. This is very important because the human body must be prevented from losing too much fluid. If the flui
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d loss reached around ten per cent of the body's normal fluid level, death would result. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But a person does not need to measure the amount of fluid in his own body because his body has a system that regulates and orders the fluid level. If you were to exam\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ine the details of this system, you would encounter a surprising wonder of engineering and planning.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Loss of body fluid results from sweating or not drinking enough water. If there were no special system in our bodies, no matter how low the density of bloo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d fluids might fall, you would not know it and would eventually die. How is the decrease in the amount of blood fluid sensed and with what measures is it corrected? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 There are special sensors in the hypothalamus area of the brain called osmoreceptors. Thes\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e sensors measure the amount of fluid in your blood at every moment you are alive. If they determine that the amount of fluid in the blood has fallen, they immediately react.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If we substitute a human being in the place of one of these receptors in the hypo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
thalamus, this person would have to measure the amount of fluid in the blood for 24 hours without tiring and without sleeping for all his life. Of course, it is impossible for a human being to carry out such a duty, yet a group of cells devotes its whole 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ife to calculating the amount of fluid in the blood. This shows that this group of cells is performing a function that has been given to it. The hypothalamus does its job under the inspiration of God.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us assume that the amount of water in blood has dro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
pped. Under this circumstance, what would a human being who was put in the place of these receptor cells have to do? If it were impossible to take a drink of water, how would you raise the amount of fluid in the blood?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you had no training in biology, it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 may not enter your mind to purify the water molecules in the urine and send them back to the blood. Even if such an idea came to your mind, you would not know how to achieve this.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At the moment the sensor cells in the hypothalamus detect a fall in the flu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
id level of the blood, they react with great ingenuity. They make use of a very special messenger hormone (the antidiuretic hormone, ADH) reserved in the pituitary gland. This message is written for the cells surrounding the millions of microscopic tubule
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  in the kidneys. A message is sent to these cells, ordering them to keep back the water molecules in the urine. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this point, several questions come to mind: How do cells located in the pituitary gland have the intelligence to send orders to kidney cells\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 far distant from themselves and which they have never seen before? How can they write a message that the kidney cells will understand and obey? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thanks to this communication system, they purify a great number of water molecules in the urine and mix them w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ith the blood again. As a result, the amount of urine is reduced and fluid in the body is restored to a certain level. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the case that we have drunk too much water, the reverse operation is put into effect. When the fluid level of the blood increases, th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e sensors in the hypothalamus slow down the release of the ADH hormone. When this happens, the absorption of fluid in the kidneys is decreased. The amount of urine increases and fluid level in the blood is held in balance.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A characteristic of the ADH hormo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ne is its ability to contract the blood vessels to cause an increase in blood pressure. This is a very well designed security assurance system and another proof of the fact that human beings are specially created. In order for such a security system to fu
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4. Where did the neural "transmission cables" of this communication network between the heart and the pituitary gland to produce such a perfect alarm system come from?

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 With the sounding of the alarm, the hypothalamus secretes the special GnRH hormone. This hormone sends a command to the pituitary gland to secrete\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 two hormones, the Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and the Luteinizing Hormone (LH).
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These two hormones have very special functions and marvelous abilities. Each one begins the process of physical differentiation and development of the male and female b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ody. The FSH and the LH hormones have been designed to effect the areas in which this change will occur and they act as if they knew very well what they have to do.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the female body, the FSH hormone causes the maturation and development of eggs in the ov\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 aries and ensures the secretion of the very important estrogen hormones by this area.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The FSH hormone is secreted according to the same formula in the male body, but here it has totally different effects\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ; it stimulates the cells in the testes and initiates the production of sperm.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the female body, the LH hormone ensures that the maturating egg is released and that another hormone called progesterone is secreted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 LH performs a different function in the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 male body. It stimulates a special group of cells in the testes called the leydig cells and ensures the secretion of testosterone.
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd1\expndtw5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is very interesting to think that these hormones are produced according to the same formula in the bodies of each of the s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
exes and that in each case the effects are totally different. How do the hormones know the difference between the male and the female body? How does it happen that a hormone composed according to one formula causes the production of testosterone in the ma
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e and progesterone in the female? How can hormones of the same formula recognize the male body on the one hand, and ensure the development of the male voice and musculature, and, on the other hand, how can they know the chemistry and special qualities of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he female body and make the changes accordingly? Who placed this wonderful genetic program in the cells according to which one hormone has different effects and causes the development of the different sexes? 
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Who has the intelligence to formulate a plan su\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ch as this? Do chance events have such intelligence? Do unconscious cells have it? Or do the atoms that form the cells have it?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is completely evident that this intelligence does not belong to chance events, to the cell or to the atoms which compose cell\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s. These developments are regulated with a view to the particularities of males and females and show us the existence of a deliberate design and plan. This plan and supreme intelligence belong to God.

ctories and modern industrial plants, the most important thing on the agenda is "productivity." Every department of a factory must work with ideal speed but it is not enough that the individual units work to the ideal speed by themselves. Every unit must 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 w\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ork in harmony with the others. If one unit thinks that there is an advantage in working on its own faster than the others, this could cause harm rather than benefit. For this reason, industrial engineers and strategic planners work in factories and plant
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to put planning into place and ensure productivity. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Imagine a factory that produces millions of different products, operates twenty-four hours a day without a break, and has 100 trillion workers. No doubt, an army of engineers and business planners would
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  be required in this factory to formulate a productivity plan and determine how quickly each group of workers will work must productively. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In real life there exists such a factory, but engineers and business administrators do not work in it. The work is d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 one by a small set of cells and the hormones that they secrete.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This factory is, of course, the human body and what is responsible for the productivity of this factory is the thyroid gland. With the help of the thyroxine hormone secreted by the thyroid gla\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nd, 100 trillion cells are individually organized to function according to a certain rhythm and at a certain rate of speed. This hormone determines how quickly nutrients are converted into energy and how efficiently food burns in the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For example, mos\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
t young people, especially those still in the process of growth, have a very high rate of metabolism, and the food they consume is quickly turned into energy. In other words, the nutrients they eat are quickly burned so that they do not gain weight easily
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 .\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Generally, as people grow older, there is no difference in their appetite but, if they eat the same amount of food as when they were younger, they gain weight. The reason for this is that, when they were younger, the body cells produce energy from their 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ood at a higher rate. When a person gets older, the energy produced by the cells from the burning of nutrients is lower and unburned food is stored in the body as fat.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If you were a factory owner, you would work to ensure that your employees worked in the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
most productive manner and, at the same time, you would make sure that they paid attention to their own health and safety. If the employees in one department of your factory worked more slowly than they should, it would not be good for the factory's gener
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l production. If there is no foreman to tell the workers what job they must do and how quickly they must do it, production will suffer.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The same thing happens in our bodies. If there were no foreman to tell your cells how quickly they must work, the result\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 would cause the activity of the cells to slow down, the food you ate would turn to fat, you would not have enough energy to raise your arm, and your whole body would come to the point of exhaustion. When too little thyroxine hormone is secreted, a condit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 on called hypothyroidism occurs which is characterized by these symptoms.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 11}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But even if you are not aware of it, your thyroid gland is working for you, secreting the thyroxine hormone that controls each one of the 100 trillion cells and prevents them from \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
slowing down. As a result, you can live your daily life normally.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Thyroxine not only prevents the cells from moving too slowly, it also prevents them from working too fast. Because this hormone is secreted in a definite amount, the speed at which the cells\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 work is kept in balance. If the cells of the body worked more quickly than they should, "toxic goiter" would develop, caused by the excessive secretion of thyroxine.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 12}{

perature and blood pressure, weight loss, excessive sweating and general nervousness. The eyes bulge in their sockets and, in advanced stages of this disease, blindness and even death (due to cardiac insufficiency) can result.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The tissues that make up the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 human body are continually being renewed. Every day approximately 200 grams of muscle and tissue cells are renewed.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How does this hormone-producing thyroid gland know the speed at which the cells in our bodies must function? How does it determine the speed of the replacement of body cells? The person himself does \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
not even know the speed at which his body's cells have to function, and most people are not even aware that their body cells have a particular speed at which they must function. If someone wanted to interfere with the speed at which his body cells work, h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 could certainly not affect the cells with his own will. In order to do this, he would have to obtain medical help or take some medication. Human beings do not determine the speed at which their own cells work; this is under the control of that small piec
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  of flesh called the thyroid gland. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How has the thyroid gland determined the ideal working speed for the cells? How does it know the working speed of the hundreds of different systems contained in the cells\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
systems that scientists are still investigating?\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 Let scientists continue to try to understand these systems; the thyroid hormone knows all the details of these systems, including what kind of intervention is needed to increase their working speed. To do this, it produces a specific molecule type and se
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ds them to each of the cells one by one. In light of this, we must accept that the cells, which make up the thyroid gland and produce thyroxine, have a much higher intelligence about this process than human beings.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Remember, like all the cells in the body,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  cells that compose the thyroid gland do not have any conscious intelligence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As can be seen in the picture on the left, a thyroid molecule is composed of lifeless, unconscious atoms. The cells perform their function according to humanly inconceivable gene\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tic program written in their nuclei. This fact brings to light even more the enormity of the miracle of creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is God, the possessor of eternal intelligence and knowledge, Who wonderfully created the cells of the body, the genetic program that determ\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Moreover, in the genetic programs of the cells that compose the thyroid gland, He wrote the molecular formula of the hormone that acc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
You will recall from earlier pages that the growth hormone is the molecule that orders the cells of a developing child to grow and multiply. This hormone stimulates the cells to grow in both size and number. But there is another
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  very important detail that must be planned\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the speed of cell division. Thyroxine influences the speed of cell division during the period of growth, ensuring complete development of the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To understand the importance of thyroxine, we just have to look \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 in a mirror. So long as there is no birth defect, every individual's mouth, nose, eyes, the face\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
in short, everyone's whole body\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 has a proportion that resembles that of almost everyone else. The body has this proportion due to the perfect functioning of t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 with this condition lack proper proportions when grown; generally they have very short legs and a large skull. In addition, a lack of thyroxine also causes dwarfism.}{

vidual cells with orders as to how much and how fast they have to multiply. As a result, a perfectly formed human body comes into being.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the majority of human beings, the amount of this molecule is adjusted in a very special way so that neither too much\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 nor too little is produced. If the amount of these hormones produced varied too much from one individual to another, there would be major physical differences between people; millions of people would be between 2.5 and 3 meters tall; millions would be on

A highly advanced and organized system has been created to regulate the amount of thyroxine secreted. The secretion of thyroxine occurs again as a result of a chain of command of a set \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of unconscious cells organized in a highly disciplined hierarchy.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When thyroxine is needed, the brain of the hormonal system\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the hypothalamus\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 sends a command (the TRH\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
Thyroid-releasing Hormone) to the conductor of the hormonal system orchestra (the pituita\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ry gland). When it receives the command, the pituitary gland understands that the thyroid gland must be activated and immediately sends a command (the TSH\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) to the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland, as the last point in this chai\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of command, immediately secretes thyroxine in compliance and distributes it throughout the whole body by way of the blood.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How is the amount of this hormone that needs to be secreted determined? How is it that, except in cases of illness, neither more nor\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  less of this hormone than is needed is secreted?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The amount of thyroxine secreted is determined by a special system created by the great artistry of God. This system is based on two separate, negative feedback mechanisms and is an example of an incomparab
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 le wonder of engineering design.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the amount of thyroxine in the blood rises above normal, the thyroxine hormone produces a very interesting effect on the pituitary gland and sometimes directly on the hypothalamus: it reduces the sensitivity of the pit
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 uitary gland to the TRH hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The function of the TRH hormone is to activate the pituitary gland to send a command (the TSH hormone) to the thyroid gland. This command is the second point on the chain of command in the production of the thyroxine hormon
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The system is so intricately designed that the excess thyroxine takes highly intelligent measures so that the sources in which it is itself produced do not make too much, and it interferes with and severes the chain of command established for its own pr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 oduction. By this means, when the thyroxine in the blood rises above normal, the production of thyroxine is automatically curtained.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We can understand this more easily with some examples: imagine that small intelligent machines were made in a factory. Thes\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e machines were made in three stages:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. First stage: computer A sends a production command to computer B.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Second stage: computer B translates this command into another language and sends it to computer C.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. Third stage: computer C begins to produce th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e desired machines with the help of a robot.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Suddenly, production exceeds what is required and there are more machines in stock than are needed. At this stage, one section of the machines in stock goes to computer B and removes the cable connecting compute
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r B with computer A. Now, computer B cannot receive a command from computer A. Since the production command cannot reach computer C, production ceases and the computers in stock last until the supply runs out. When the stock runs low, the cable connecting
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 computer A with computer B is again attached by the machines and production resumes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If such machines were made which could supervise their own production and that of the machines that produce them so intelligently, a revolution in industry and technology \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
would be the result. In every human being, there exists such a fantastic system of production occurring every minute. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A second system also determines the amount of thyroxine produced. An in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
crease in the amount of thyroxine affects the cells in the hypothalamus. These cells reduce the production of TRH and, therefore, the amount of TSH secreted in the pituitary gland is reduced. By this way, the production of thyroxine is slowed down.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Using t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he above factory example, it is useful to examine this second system. The effect of the thyroxine on the hypothalamus and its curtailment of the production of TSH can be compared to the machines produced in our imaginary factory that slow down the informa
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ion flow from that computer. Not only the communication between computer A and computer B is cut, but computer A is also slowed down, thus being prevented from sending a command to computer B. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the amount of thyroxine in the blood is reduced, the syst\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
em works in the reverse direction. More commands are sent from computer A and the capacity of computer B to receive these commands is increased. As a result, the hypothalamus secretes more TRH hormone, the pituitary gland becomes more sensitive to TRH, an
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  raises the production of the TSH hormone. In this way, more thyroxine is produced and secreted.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 16}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How does the thyroxine hormone know that the chain of command must be broken in order to stop its production? How do the cells in the hypothalamus know that,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 when the level of thyroxine is high, its secretion must be stopped and, when it is low, its secretion must be increased? How did this flawless system come into being? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To think that this intricately planned system came to be by time, chance, and natural l\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aw is more outside the realm of sound thinking than to think that a computer or a television could come into being by a similar process. In order for this system to be able to function, hundreds of specially designed molecular sized structures (which we h

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After the free thyroxine molecules enter the target cells, other thyroxine molecules that detach from their carrier molecules take their place. The carrier molecules serve as a storage \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
reservoir to ensure that enough thyroxine is ready when needed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 We have already seen how delicately the balance of the amount of thyroxine required to affect the cells is adjusted and the medical problems that can result if the amount of thyroxine rises or\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 falls. This delicate balance involves a proportion of four free to ten thousand bound thyroxine molecules. In the light of this, these questions must be asked:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Who counted these trillions of molecules and decided that only close to four out of ten thousan\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 helpless. The fact that you are unable to measure the amount of calcium in the blood in front of you may result in the patient's death.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Let us change our example slightly: Now you are given one liter of blood which contains no calcium, and you have to add \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the right amount of it. How many spoonfuls of calcium would you take from the container and add to the blood? What is the correct amount of this vital substance that must be added to one liter of blood?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 You will never encounter this situation; the example \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
has been given just to emphasize the importance of the amount of calcium in the blood. If a liter of blood were placed before you containing no calcium, the amount of calcium you would have to mix with it would be one tenth of a gram. In the five liters o
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 blood in your body, there needs to be a total of only half a gram of calcium. If there is any more or less than this, serious illness or even death may result. Clearly, the human body has been created in a marvelously delicate balance. A person weighing 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 8\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 0 kilos requires only half a gram of calcium circulating in his blood\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 any more or less, and he will die.

After we have seen the importance of the amount of calcium in the blood, this question inevitably comes to mind: what is the mechanism that determines this amount that is so vital for life? The answer to this question reveals another wonder of creation. B

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If the parathyroid cells conclude as a result of their measurement that the amount of calcium has fallen too low, they immediately secrete parathorm\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
one. At this stage, the cells demonstrate another conscious activity: They "understand" that the level of calcium has fallen and take appropriate action to restore the deficiency.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Put yourself in the place of the parathyroid cells and think: If you were aware that the calcium level in the blood had decreased, what remedy would you use to increase the level of calcium?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To answer this question you would have to be a scientist with eve\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ry means at your disposal to investigate the human body. If people had no knowledge about calcium in the body, it would be necessary to do years of research and receive assistance from the best biochemists in the world. There would be only one purpose for
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 this effort\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 to find sources of calcium that could be used in the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Finally, at the end of your research you would learn that there is a great amount of calcium stored in the bones and that some calcium leaves the body in the urine. You would learn that\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 calcium comes into the body from food through the intestines.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the light of this, the three measures you could take to increase blood calcium are:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. Borrow some of calcium from the bones.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. Find a way to recover the calcium excreted in the urine.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. A\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rrange to have more calcium taken from the food.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But each one of these functions takes us into a different field of expertise.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before deciding on the first choice, you would have to persuade the bone cells to lend you a portion of the calcium they have sto\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
red in the bones. The bone cells (osteocytes) do not want to lose any of the calcium, which is very important to the bones. However, you must find a chemical formula that will allow the bone cell to release some of its stored calcium into the blood. In or
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
er to find this formula, you will have to be aware of all the chemical secrets of the bone cells down to the smallest detail and also the process by which the calcium is stored. Then you will have to devise a molecular formula to reverse this process. Mor
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
over, you will have to obtain in a moment all the information pertinent to the inner structure of cells whose secrets human beings have been trying to discover for a hundred years. At the end of your lengthy researches, you will find the miraculous formul
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  to persuade the bone cells to liberate some calcium\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that formula is parathormone. (See figure 1) 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But there are still other things you have to do. You must find two other formulas to ensure that the second and third functions are carried out.
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd-1\expndtw-5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 To make the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
second choice feasible, you must persuade the cells in the kidneys to conserve the calcium in the urine and mix it with the blood again. Normally, there is no necessity for these cells to search for calcium in the urine. This time you must solve all the m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
steries in the inner workings of kidney cells, which are quite different from bone cells. Then, you must find one molecule in an endless combination of molecules that can activate the kidney cells to find calcium in the urine. Finally, if you manage to pr
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 duce this special formula, you will have witnessed one of the greatest wonders in the world, and the formula you obtain is exactly the same as the first formula you discovered\hich\f0 \emdash 
\loch\f0 parathormone. Molecules having the same formula are able to make cells perform \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 wo totally different functions, a wonder that cannot be explained by the operation of evolution.}{
\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now there remains a third thing you must do. You must get the body to retain more calcium from the food that it consumes.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The mixing of the calcium in the food\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 you eat with the blood occurs in the small intestine, but in order for the calcium to be reabsorbed, the intestinal cells need "activated vitamin D." Here, a major problem arises, because the vitamin D you obtain through your food is inactive.}{

for your intestines to absorb more calcium (therefore, to increase the amount of it in the blood), this problem must be solved. A special molecule must exist that will change the chemical make up of inactivated vitamin D and activate it. Again, you must d
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 much research and many experiments in order to design a special molecule that will activate the vitamin D. At the end of your research, you will find the formula of the molecule needed to activate the vitamin D (and to ensure the absorption of calcium by
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the cells of the intestine) is the same as the formula of parathormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Think about this: Three different unrelated ways have been discovered to increase the amount of calcium in the blood, but the key to causing these three different systems to function i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s the same
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this key alters the operation of the three systems. What is more surprising is that, when the operation of these three systems (with their very different structures and ways of functioning) is changed, the result is the same
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the amount of calci\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m in the blood increases.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that three different systems begin to work with the same key toward the same goal is a proof of the perfection and incomparable harmony of God's creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the amount of calcium in the blood falls, the parathyroid cel\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ls demonstrate an incredible awareness. Using the appropriate key to alter the operation of each of the three systems, they ingeniously produce one molecule\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 parathormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this way, they raise the level of calcium in the blood by ensuring that the bone c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ells release calcium, that the kidney cells extract more calcium from the urine, and that vitamin D is activated so that the digestive system can obtain more calcium.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How did the parathyroid cells find this ingenious formula? How do they know that this mol\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecule will affect the bones, the kidneys and activate vitamin D? How is it that in the countless numbers of people who have lived in the course of history, the parathyroid has managed (except in cases of illness) to produce the right formula? How do the p

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Adrenaline (epinephrine) is produced and stored in the adrenal medulla\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the inner portion of the adrenal glands. Everyone has this hormone in him all his life; you have it in you right now. I

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Although such an important hormone, the concentration of adrenaline in the bloodstream is surprisingly small compared to the work it does. It has been calculated, for example, that if the a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
mount of blood in our bodies were compared to a lake 100 meters in diameter and two meters deep, the adrenaline in our blood would be the equivalent of one teaspoon of fluid poured into the lake.}{\f0\fs22\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The powerful effect of a small amount of this fluid on th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The physical requirements of a normal person will certainly not be the same as that\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of a person in danger. Consider the needs of a person who is confronted by a dangerous situation: he must run fast, his muscles must work more quickly, his blood pressure must rise, and his heart must beat more quickly. So, he will be able to run faster,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 escape more quickly or fight more strongly against the danger. How does all this happen?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the danger occurs, an alarm button is pushed in the body, and the brain sends a lightening-fast command to the adrenal glands. The cells in the interior section o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f the adrenal gland then go into alarm mode and secrete adrenaline hormone to deal with the emergency. The adrenaline molecules mix with the blood and disperse throughout the various areas of the body.

ins and arteries that ensures the vital organs receive a greater supply of blood at the times of danger, and to do this, they dilate the blood vessels going to the heart, brain and muscles. The cells surrounding the vessels obey the adrenaline and supply

A microscopically small hormone adjusts the diameter of the hundreds of blood vessels in your body where the blood is to be directed.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For every organ in the body, the action of adrenaline is different; when the adrenaline molecule goes to the blood vessels\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, it causes them to dilate; when it goes to the heart, it quickens the contraction of the heart cells. This makes the heart beat faster and supplies the extra strength that the muscles need.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the adrenaline molecule reaches the muscle cells, the muscle\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s can contract with much more strength. The adrenaline molecules that go to the liver command the cells located there to mix more sugar with the blood. This causes the amount of sugar in the blood to increase and supplies the extra fuel needed by the musc

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
This activity of the adrenaline hormone in the body requires a great amount of intelligence, knowledge and skill. This tiny molecule knows what it must do and when; when the body does not need it, the alarm mode is never set into operation. Apart from 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
this, it knows very well to which cells it must go, and what kind of command it must give to them. Moreover, this shows that it is well acquainted with the cells, with the organs and their functions, and it never makes an error as to when the body must be

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If it made such an error, the body would be irreparably damaged. But these little molecules function with a keen awareness of their responsibility. How is it possible for an unconscious, lifeless fluid, without a brain, ey

ms are adjusting your blood pressure. The "aldosterone" hormone produced in the adrenal glands has the duty of preventing a fall in your blood pressure and adjusting the sodium balance in your body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In your body exists as little as one gram in ten million \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 of aldosterone. Research has shown that from one ton of adrenal glands, only ten milligrams of aldosterone is secreted.}{

 In order to obtain one gram of aldosterone, it would be necessary to collect the aldosterone secreted from the adrenal glands of a tot\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
al of ten million people. The human body is created in such a delicate balance that a deficiency in such a small quantity of this hormone results in death.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As explained above, aldosterone has two purposes: to increase the concentration of sodium (Na+) in t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he blood and to raise blood pressure. These two requirements are intimately connected to each other and aldosterone is a finely designed solution for meeting these two needs at the same time. If the quantity of sodium in the blood increases, the fluid lev
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 l in the blood also rises with it. This is because molecules of water have a tendency to go where sodium is high.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Here is where we see the excellence of the design of aldosterone. On the one hand, it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 increases the amount of sodium; on the other, it uses the capacity of sodium to absorb fluid. When the blood level of sodium falls, aldosterone warns the cells in the tiny tubes of the kidneys. These cells intercept the sodium ions in the urine and reabs
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rb them. This causes the sodium ions to enter the cells forming the tiny tubes, and from there they are released again into the blood.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In this way, the amount of sodium is raised, the ion balance is maintained, the amount of fluid in the blood is increased\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, and blood pressure is restored to its normal level. When the sodium ions in the tiny tubes of the kidneys are restored, potassium ions (K+) are secreted from the blood to the urine because the proportion of sodium and potassium in the blood must}{

very particular rate. The mineral proportion is very important to ensure the proper acid-base balance in the fluid inside and outside the cells, and for the proper functioning of the nervous system. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Aldosterone is produced in the exterior portion of the a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
drenal gland. The cells in this portion have never seen the cells in the depths of the kidneys (and there is no possibility for them to encounter them). How is it that these cells know how to produce the right hormone for the reabsorption of sodium and th

em, we must ask, "Could this system have come into being as the result of unconscious chance?"
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This question is important because time, chance, and the results of natural law are the reasons offered by history's worst deceit for its denial of the existence\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 of God; the theory of evolution bases its account of the development of living things on this foundation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The deceit of evolution claims that human beings and everything else ultimately came into existence by chance. However, the system that we are about \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to examine is, by itself, enough to reveal the real nature of the myth of chance and to show the deceitful enterprise of evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The system is constructed so that it will come into operation when there is a blood pressure drop. It begins its role when t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he blood pressure drops below a certain level, like a fire alarm sensor specially designed to detect smoke coming from a fire.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the blood pressure falls, the alarm sounds because low blood pressure can be very serious. When the alarm sounds, a series o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
f measures must be taken to raise it. These measures include the following: 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. The blood vessels must be constricted. (This constriction will cause a rise in blood pressure, as is the case when a garden hose is compressed in the end.)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. More water must b\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e absorbed from the kidneys and mixed with the blood to raise the blood fluid level.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 3. A person must be made to drink water as soon as possible.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A flawless system has been placed in the depths of the human body to put these measures into effect. At the mo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ment when the blood pressure falls (or the amount of sodium in the blood becomes less), certain cells in the kidneys become aware of the problem. The Juxtaglomerular cells secrete a very important substance called "renin."}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 It is a wonder that cells can d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 etect a drop in blood pressure or in the amount of sodium present and then secrete renin, the first link in a long chain that raises blood pressure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In blood plasma, there is a protein that normally has a neutral effect as it\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 circulates in the blood. This protein, called angiotensiogen, is produced in the liver. The first stage of this incredible planning starts here. Angiotensiogen and renin have no functions of their own, but they were designed specially to unite with one a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 other. How is it possible that they are specially produced like logo blocks designed to fit perfectly into one another?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Consider this: kidney cells and liver cells are far removed from one another. How is it that one of these groups of cells produces one p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
art (renin) and the other group produces the other part (angiotensiogen) in such a way as to fit perfectly with the first part? Could this happen as the result of unconscious chance? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Certainly not! It is not possible that such a process could occur by cha\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 nce.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Renin changes the composition of the angiotensiogen molecule, causing the emergence of a new molecule, angiotensin I:
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Renin + Angiotensiogen Angiotensin I
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This new molecule has no function either. Found in the lungs, an enzyme called angiotensin conve\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rting enzyme (ACE for short) functions to break down the angiotensin I molecule. Because of this enzyme, angiotensin I changes into a different molecule, angiotensin II.
\par 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Angiotensin I + ACE enzyme Angiotensin II
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Two different molecules produced in the kid\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
neys and the liver act on each other and a new molecule is produced. Lung cells that have no relation to kidney cells and liver cells produce an enzyme to unite completely with this new molecule. Moreover, they produce this enzyme long before it unites wi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
h these molecules. How do lung cells produce the right enzyme for a process that has not yet developed to interact with a material that has not yet been produced? How does it know how to make an enzyme that will change a non-functional hormone into a func
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ional hormone? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Again, it is clear that each stage is a designed system. The angiotensin II produced as a result of these stages is a proof of design and planning. This enzyme has two vital functions that would lead the system to the desired end result: th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e first of these functions is the constriction of the blood vessels (the first of the three desired results that we enumerated at the beginning of this section). Angiotensin II stimulates the muscles surrounding the blood vessels and activates the mechani
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 m that contracts these muscles. In this way, the muscles contract, narrowing the diameter of the blood vessels and raising the blood pressure.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Could this happen by unconscious chance?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Again, this is impossible; Angiotensin II is specially designed to const\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rict the blood vessels and these is no room for chance in this flawless design.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another important function of angiotensin II is to summon into action the wonderful aldosterone hormone. Angiotensin II reaches the adrenal glands and gives the command to secr\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ete aldosterone. This is another proof of planning: when aldosterone mixes with the blood, it causes the kidneys to absorb the fluid in the urine. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As a result, the blood pressure will rise. This is the second result we want to achieve.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The material produc\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ed in concerted effort (and according to a plan by the kidneys, lungs and liver) brings about the secretion of the hormone causing a rise in blood pressure. In order to do this, it is necessary that the kidney cells, lung cells and liver cells form a coal
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 i\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 tion.\tab 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Before all else, this coalition must investigate what they need to do when blood pressure drops to make a decision about the best way "to constrict the blood vessels" and "to ensure the secretion of aldosterone."
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Later, they must again make an inves\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tigation and analyze the anatomy of the adrenal glands and that of the cells in the muscles of the blood vessels and determine the way in which they function. Later, they will have to determine the molecular make-up of Angiotensin II to cause the muscles 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f the blood vessels to contract, and the adrenal glands to secrete aldosterone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 That last thing that must be done is to determine how this molecule will be produced. Every organ must take responsibility for one stage in its production. In terms of the prod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uction plan, there is a three-stage assembly system in which every organ is given a function. The kidney will produce renin, the liver will produce angiotensiogen and the lungs will produce ACE. Afterwards, the cells must return to their normal roles. 

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
someone does not believe that this system was created by a supreme power according to a special plan, that person must accept the view that unconscious cells achieved this by the mechanisms of neo-Darwinism (mutation and natural selection). The claims of 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
volutionists are unbelievable and illogical because this system (comprised of the kidney, liver and lung cells), which is irreducibly complex, must have come into being all at once at the same time. The probability of this happening by chance would requir

a hormone called "Cortisol." But this hormone has such a varied function in the human body that we must note a point before we begin. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that a hormone can activate a cell is in itself a wonder because, in or\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
der for a hormone to affect this cell, it must activate the inner systems of the cell. This happens either by attaching to a receptor on the membrane of the cell, or by direct entry into the cell and activating a mechanism inside. But in each case, it is 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecessary that the hormone molecule be specially designed for the cell it will act on. If there is the slightest incompatibility in the structure of the hormone molecule and its receptor, the cell will not be affected. For this reason, the relation between
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 the hormone and the receptor on the cell it affects has been compared to a lock and a key. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When we examine the effects of cortisol, we discover a very important fact. God has created security systems in the human body and He has placed locks in the cells \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
of each of these different security systems; only a single key can open these locks. For example, this key can be inside a capillary cell, or it can also be in a liver cell. This allows different cells to go into concerted action towards a common goal. No
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
doubt, this is an example of God's artistry in creation; it is also a proof of the evolutionist deceit. The fact that different cells are programmed to work together towards a common goal, and that there is a central system that makes this program work, s
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ows once again the invalidity of the myth of chance as proposed by the theory of evolution.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The cortisol hormone works inside the human body fighting on different fronts against pain, wounds, infection, overheating, hypothermia, allergies, lack of oxygen, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hunger, and factors that increase body temperature.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As we examine the functions of cortisol, we must not forget that unconscious cells that cannot know where it will be used produce this hormone. These cells can never be consciously aware of the fronts on 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 which cortisol fights.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Now, let us examine briefly the functions performed by this wonder called "cortisol" produced in the adrenal glands, and let us see once again how the artistry of God is manifested in the aspects of the human body. At each stage, ask
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  yourself if this system could have come into being by evolution, and the answer will show the real nature of the theory of evolution.

or a certain time after they are born, male and female children resemble one another. But after years, differences begin \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to emerge in the bodies of each. A beard appears in males, their voices deepen, their shoulders widen, and they come to have the typical features of the male body. Girls begin to take on the typical female form. Two bodies that resembled each other closel
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 , except for the sex organs, take on quite a different appearance after the secretion of the sex hormones in adolescence.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 What brings about the change in male and female bodies are the sex hormones that God has created in a highly organized manner.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The mai\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
n sex hormone in the male is testosterone; in the female, they are estrogen and progesterone. When we look at the mechanisms by which these hormones are secreted, we meet a few other wonders of creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Sex hormones are secreted in the male testes and in \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the female ovaries. But the system that ensures this secretion is located very distantly from these organs, in the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus area.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Many years from the time of birth pass before the sex hormones go into action. But when the right \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
time comes, when the child has reached the age of adolescence, the hypothalamus sends a command (the GnRH hormone) to the pituitary gland. The fact that the hypothalamus does not make a mistake in timing (unless damaged) is remarkable. How can a small pie
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e of flesh take account of days, months and years without a calendar (or more precisely, without the conscious intelligence required to understand a calendar) and do everything with perfect timing? This fact is a proof that the hypothalamus has been desig
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed by God in a way to properly affect this timing.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After receiving the command, the pituitary gland secretes two hormones, LH and FSH. The target areas of these hormones are the female ovaries and the male testes. These hormones give a command to these org
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ans to "go into action" after years of being inactive.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The testes and the ovaries then begin to produce the sex cells proper to males and females and to secrete the sex hormones. The LH and FSH hormones in men and women have the same molecular structure, y
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 et each is responsible for different processes in the male and female bodies.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In the section entitled "Hormones That Are Able to Regulate Time and Produce the Differences between the Sexes" we examined the wonder that these hormones have different effects \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
and that they wait years to be secreted.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Now, let us examine how the male and female reproductive systems develop and see what kind of system God has created for each new human being that has come into the world.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Just before this four-week period, the pituitary gland secretes the LH hormone. After this hormone leaves the skull, it sets out on its long journey via the blood stream and reaches the ovaries. Now the time has come for the ovaries to
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  go into action.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Inside the ovaries are thousands of immature egg cells. Under the influence of the LH hormone from the pituitary gland, part of these egg cells begins to mature. Normally, only one of these developing cells will fully mature and be release
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d from the ovary as an egg cell. (If two cells are released and each one is fertilized, twins will be born)
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The egg cell in process of development with its surrounding nutritive layers is called a "follicle." The FSH hormone sent by the pituitary gland has\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 a major effect on the follicle, suddenly causing it to produce a special molecule. This molecule is the estrogen hormone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How is it that the follicle, which is itself not fully developed, has begun to produce a hormone? What is the purpose of this product\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

One of the targets of the estrogen hormone is the "uterus." This is where the fertilized egg will lodge, multiply and grow. The influence of estrogen causes the uterus to prepare for pregnancy; its wall increases 3-4 times in thickness and is surrounded b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  capillary vessels. If fertilization occurs, these vessels will supply the required nutrients.

When the mature egg enters the second period of its four-week life (about 14 days later), it is released from the ovaries. Now, the egg cell begins its journey to the mother's womb. If it is fertilized during this journey, it will begin a new life; if
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  it is not fertilized it will die and be expelled from the body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the egg cell leaves the ovary and starts its journey, it is still supported by the inside of the ovary it left behind and also by the pituitary gland located at a far distance from it. T\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
he pituitary gland knows that the released egg needs help and secretes a special hormone called LTH. This hormone travels by way of the blood to the ovaries and affects the mass of cells called the "corpus luteum" in the ovary, which in turn secretes prog
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sterone.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The progesterone hormone has a special design and a very special purpose. This hormone, although it never leaves the ovaries and never sees the world outside them, influences cells located far distant from it, ensuring that these cells act accordi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ng to a definite plan. This is yet another example of the wonder of creation that occurs in the human body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When progesterone molecules reach the uterus, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 they cause, as in the case of the estrogen meeting the egg cell, that certain preparations are made. In one sense they increase the strength of estrogen.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Progesterone also affects the ovary itself, by preventing a new egg cell from being released. Otherwis\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
e, as an embryo was developing in the mother's womb, a second egg cell would be fertilized, producing a great danger both for the developing embryo and the mother. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How does progesterone know that, after fertilization has occurred, a second fertilization m\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ust not happen and that it is necessary to stop the activity of the ovary to prevent it? Who gave this ability to progesterone, which is only a molecule? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Another special function of progesterone is to diminish the influence of the oxytocin hormone secrete\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d by the pituitary gland. As we saw earlier, oxytocin is a hormone that goes into effect as the time of birth approaches and ensures that the uterine muscles will contract. As a result of these contractions, the baby comes out of the mother's womb more ea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ily.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
If oxytocin affected the uterus during the first days of fertilization, these muscles would eject the fertilized egg as it attached itself to the uterine wall, and pregnancy would never occur. Progesterone goes into effect at this stage and inhibits t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he influence of oxytocin, preventing the fertilized egg from being ejected. Progesterone is amazingly designed to negate the effect of oxytocin. 
\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd1\expndtw5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 How do the cells, which produce progesterone, know about the existence of oxitocin? Remember, progesterone is \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
produced by cells inside the ovary. Oxytocin is produced far away from ovary, in the pituitary gland located in the skull. How did oxytocin learn what causes the uterus to contract, and that the fertilized egg could be ejected? What intelligence designed 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 t\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 he progesterone molecule to prevent this? 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The planning here demonstrates the existence of an intelligence that did the planning. And, in order for this planning to be done, this intelligence must know all the detailed aspects of the human body. God, Who h
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as created human beings with all their special characteristics, has created an ideal harmony in the progesterone-oxytocin mechanism.
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Progesterone has another special feature, which is still another proof of the helplessness of human beings before God Who c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 reated them.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The moment a fertilized egg cell reaches the wall of the uterus and begins to grow there, it becomes something foreign in the mother's body. The immune cells in the mother's body would inevitably attack this group of cells as they multiply. Th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is attack would end the life of the baby even before it began and pregnancy would never occur. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 But progesterone prevents the cells of the immune system from attacking the zygote in the wall of the uterus. Besides its other functions, progesterone also pro\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
tects the developing group of cells from being attacked. Certainly, this shows once again that progesterone was created by a high intelligence, that is, by God.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As noted earlier, secretion of progesterone occurs in the second half of a four-week period. If\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 fertilization does not occur in this period of time, the amount of progesterone and estrogen in the blood quickly decreases because it is no longer necessary to make preparations for a new human. These preparations (the multiplying capillary vessels to f
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed the fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus) are expelled from the body, a process called menstruation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The secretion of the FSH hormone four weeks later in the pituitary gland corresponds to a new egg cell that begins to maturate in the ovary, and ano\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ther new four-week preparation period starts.

\par }{\f0\fs22\expnd1\expndtw5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 After birth, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called LHRH every 3-4 hours, but the amount secreted is very small. About ten years later, the hypothalamus 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 actually "understands" that the time has come to begin the shaping of the male body and begins to secrete LHRH in smaller intervals.}{\f0\fs22\expnd1\expndtw5\up4\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 43}{
\f0\fs22\expnd1\expndtw5\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  The LHRH hormone moves to the second link in the chain of command, the pituitary gland. As \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
soon as the pituitary gland receives the command, it secretes another hormone called LH. This hormone gives the command to activate the male sex glands, the testes.
\par }{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Why do all these functions take so long to begin and how can we explain the timing of these\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 mechanisms? The answers to these questions are still unknown to the world of science. In any case, this system (whose secrets human beings have not been able to solve) has operated since the beginning of history in the body of every human being.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When the \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
LH hormone reaches the testes via the bloodstream, the cells there begin to produce a hormone called testosterone. The cells that produce testosterone know the time has come for the body they occupy to pass from childhood to manhood. The chemical formula 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f the testosterone they produce will turn a developing child into a man. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Testosterone molecules disperse to various parts of the body and know what they must do to certain cells in these areas. Some of the functions of testosterone in forming the male bod\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 y are as follows:

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Testosterone molecules cause the multiplication of muscle cells. For this reason, the male body is more muscular and stronger than the female body. The increase in muscle mass gives the male body its characteristic appearance.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At the same\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  time, testosterone molecules affect the cells in the roots of the hair, causing the beard and mustache to appear. The hairline on the forehead is drawn farther back.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Testosterone affects the vocal cords causing a male voice to be lower than that of a woma\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n. In addition, the testosterone molecule gives the male body its ability to fertilize the female egg.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Certainly it is surprising that an unconscious molecule can do all this. This molecule knows the particularities of the male body and directs trillions o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 f cells in the formation of this body.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Testosterone molecule is not limited to these things. Clear evidence of design can be seen in the mechanism by which this hormone exerts its influence. In order to bring about its effects, testosterone reaches the tar
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 geted tissues (the male genital organs) and enters the cells. Inside the cell, it unites with an enzyme specially created for it whereby its effects are greatly increased.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This newly formed hormone then unites with a special receptor designed specially for\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 it. The resulting molecular combination unites with the cell's DNA and uses the information received from the DNA to bring about a new protein synthesis. This operation ensures that the distinction between male and female bodies, and their different sexu

tion performed for human beings by many proteins is still largely unknown. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The communications system among cells in some ways resembles systems used by human beings. For example, on the membranes of the cells there are "antennae" that allow them to sense \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the messages that come to them. Immediately under these antennae are "power stations" which decode the message sent to the cell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 These antennae are located on the one hundred thousandth of a millimeter thick cell membrane that surrounds the cell. This rece\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ptor, which is known as "tyrosine kinase," is composed of three basic sections: the antenna, the body and the tail. The shape of the part of the antenna that projects out from the cell membrane resembles a dish antenna used to collect satellite transmissi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ns. Just as each dish antenna is designed to receive certain satellite transmissions, there are different receptors that understand the language of the messages carried by various hormone molecules.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The messages coming from different cells/hormones come in\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to contact with the antennae on the cell membrane, but each antenna is designed to sense only one single message. This is a very special instance of design and because of this, a message cannot be sent in error to another cell. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The great harmony in which \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
hormones and antennae are created in relation to one another can be compared to the lock-and-key relation observed in almost all biological activity. Only the right key can open the lock; that is, only the right cell will have anything to do with the mess
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 a\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ge sent, this message being without meaning for other cells. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At the moment the hormone reaches the cell, it sets an incredible system into motion. By means of a very special communications system, the message coming to the cell is sent to that cell's DNA.\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 The cell is then moved in action according to the message. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 In order to und\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
erstand just how wonderful this operation is, think about an ordinary occurrence that everyone can encounter in their daily life. Information is sent via the Internet to a personal computer connected to a network of other computers. The information sent t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the computer is transmitted to another unit, for example, to a printer, and the printer puts the information on paper. People have been using computers since the 1980's; they are used at home and in the workplace and, since the mid 90's, the Internet has
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
become a part of people's lives. If you read in a newspaper one day that a computer has been built that was too small for the eye to see, and that this computer was communicating with other computers, your reaction would be quite different. Perhaps you wo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ld not believe that this technology could be compacted to such a small size. However, in real life there is a communications system with a technology much more highly developed that this, working in an area too small for the eye to see.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that a mes\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sage coming to a cell's antennae is transmitted at great speed to the nucleus of the cell, and that a highly advanced technology is employed in the process of this communication, is a much greater wonder than a microscopically small computer. This is beca

antenna is then transmitted to the tail located in the inner section of the cell. The body of the microscopic communications antenna enters the fluid (cytoplasm) between the nucleus of the cell and its membrane. The connection established between the horm

ne and the antenna initiates a chemical reaction. This reaction causes the antennae, which were individual units, to form into groups of two, and brings about a change in the shape of the tail sections. This operation, called "phosphorilation," is a chang

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Until recently, no one had any idea of how the messages carried by hormones reached the nucleus so speedily and with such precision. How is it that no error is made in the course of the\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The fact that, within a cell one hundredth of a millimeter in size, a billion proteins are moving at every moment, brings these questions to mind: How do the proteins produced know where they must g\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

by the planned union of hundreds of amino acids. A special section of between 10 and 30 amino acids form a kind of chain that forms the zip code of the protein. In other words, the zip code written on the envelope is composed of numbers and letters, while
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the zip code in a protein is composed of amino acids. This code is located on one of the ends of the protein or inside it. As a result, every new protein that is synthesized receives instructions as to where it will go inside the cell and how it will go t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ere. Now, let us examine under a highly advanced microscope the journey of a protein within a cell.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 When we look at how a newly synthesized protein, goes to its proper place\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 for example, endoplasmic reticulum\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 we see the following: First, the zip code is re
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ad by a particle of a molecule called SRP. SRP (Signal Recognition Particle) is a structure especially designed to read the zip code and to help the protein find the channels through which it must pass. It interprets the code in the protein, binds to it a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
d shows it the way like a real guide. Then, the SRP and the protein lock into a protein passage channel and a receptor on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum specially designed for them. When the receptor is stimulated in this way, the channel on th
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  membrane is opened. At this stage, the SRP separates from the receptor. All these operations occur with perfect timing and harmony.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 At this point, the protein encounters a problem. It is known that proteins are formed when the amino acid chain bends and c\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ontorts into a three-dimensional shape. In this situation, it is impossible for protein molecules to pass from the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum because the passage channel on its membrane is only 0.000000002 meter in diameter. But here we see the
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
existence of a perfect previously designed plan because this problem has already been solved in the production stage. The ribosome that produces the protein produces it in the shape of an uncontorted chain. The structure of this chain makes it possible fo
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 the protein to pass through the channel. After the passage is complete, the channel is closed until another passage occurs. The work of the code section in the protein that enters the endoplasmic reticulum comes to an end. For this reason, this section i
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 separated from the protein by particular enzymes; afterwards, the protein folds and takes on its final three dimensional appearance. This situation is like what happens after the letter has reached its destination; the function of the zip code written on
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
the envelope comes to an end. How these enzymes can act consciously and know which of the hundreds, sometimes thousands of amino acids on the protein they will tear off is another wonder. If they tear off any one of the amino acids that make up the protei
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
, other than those that compose the code, the protein may become useless. As we see, at every stage many particles act with consciousness and responsibility. It is a plain fact that this conscious sense of responsibility cannot belong to tiny molecules.

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e fact is that the cooperation among the molecules that have a role in these complex functions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0

When we say nitric oxide is "simple," we only refer to the simplicity of its chemical composition. With regard to its importance to human life, intense research over the past twenty years has shown that this molecule performs a basic functio
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Poisonous nitric oxide is a gas that causes air pollution and acid rain, destroys the ozone layer and the ecological environment. This gas is produced by \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The endothelial cell knows \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 what chemical material must be used and in what proportion to produce the NO molecule. There is no error in production. For example, N}{

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 This remarkable factory in the depths of\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

Earlier we mentioned that, although nitric oxide carries vital messages, it is also a poisonous molecule. So, the role of NO in the immune system is related to its poisonous qualities. This molecule is s\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ecreted by macrophages, which are important in the body's immune system. Recall that macrophages are microorganisms 0.01 of a millimeter in size. By a process called phagocytosis, they remove (swallow) bacteria and molecules, which are dangerous for our b
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 o\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
dies. When a macrophage meets germs or bacteria that cause sickness, it surrounds them; afterwards, the bacteria that are embraced on every side by the macrophages are subjected to a bombardment of nitric oxide. In this way, nitric oxide molecules start a
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 reaction to destroy the bacteria. Certainly, the cooperation between nitric oxide and macrophages is one of the countless proofs of the harmonious creation.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The NO molecules have another interesting role in the immune system. Research has shown that NO ren\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ders the "protease" enzyme found in some viruses ineffective. This enzyme breaks down big proteins into small parts that are used in the production of new viruses. NO puts this enzyme out of operation, preventing the virus from multiplying.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Tiny molecules \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
find other molecules in a body that they have never before encountered and know very well how to neutralize their effects. In this way, people can be rescued from great dangers that they were not even aware of. It is very clear that all this order and con
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 n\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ection among molecules cannot be the result of chance. God, the Lord of the universe, has given the NO molecules their function and created them with their special qualities.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Research in this field continues, and it is thought that, in the near future, sci\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
entists will be able to use nitric oxide in the fight against cancer. Each new bit of information that comes to light will show once again that this molecule is a product of extraordinary design.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Every day, the nitric oxide molecule is subject of new resea\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
rch, and the results of this research amaze even scientists. What is known at this point is that this messenger molecule is produced in various cells throughout our whole body, and that it has important functions in many bodily operations. In order to und
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 rstand how utterly astonishing the activities of this molecule are, put yourself for a moment in the place of NO and imagine that you are undertaking its duties.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 1. First, imagine that you must take over the role of this molecule in adjusting the blood ves\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 sels. In order to do this successfully, you must first know the circulatory system and its components
\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 heart, blood and blood vessels\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 very well.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 2. In the course of various daily activities such as sleeping, eating and playing sports, you will need to commu\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
nicate messages about the adjustment of blood pressure to the relevant organs. In doing this, you cannot overlook anything or make the slightest error. Otherwise, the blood pressure would fall lower or rise higher than normal, opening the way for a stroke
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 shock, heart attack and other conditions that could result in death. Moreover, remember that the veins, arteries, and capillaries in our bodies have a total length of more than 100 thousand kilometers. Given this, you can safely guess that you could not 
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 p\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ossibly perform this duty.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
3. It is known that NO is used as a messenger in our brain during the process of learning. These operations are so complex that a large part of them is still not understood. Therefore, the concerted efforts of the whole scientifi
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 c world could not possibly accomplish this messenger function, let alone you, a single individual.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 4. Do not forget the part played by nitric oxide in the successful fight by the immune system against viruses and bacteria.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 5. Moreover, in this section we h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ave not touched on the role of the messenger in the functioning of the lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach and the reproductive system. When you take the place of NO in a human body, you must understand the language of all these organs; you must be an expert i

 them all. Of course, this is not enough because there is nothing that can be compared to the human body with all its organs working in harmony and all its trillions of cells performing incredibly complex functions.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 6. Finally, you must keep in mind that, \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
if this messenger is not used in the right proportion, with the right timing and in just the right place, harmful and dangerous results could occur. This could be compared to a person who has done very complicated processes with dynamite or some other exp

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can replicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of th\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as "evolutionary mechanisms" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mech\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 anism of "natural selection." The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: }{

So, how could these "favorable variations" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin,
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evol
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 v\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ed from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book }{\i\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The Origin of Specie}{\f0\fs22\insrsid3488473\charrsid10312418 \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism.

nly known, Neo-Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the "cause of favorable variations" in additi

\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
Today, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo-Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lung
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
s, and wings) underwent "mutations," that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The reason for this \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows:

 at the back of the brain, the "center of vision." These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 The brain is insulated from light. That means that its \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0

\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made fo\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
r this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 d\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 imensional perspective with depth. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to wat
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 e eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye co\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
uld not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hea
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 ing in the brain. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely si
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
lent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at t
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 h\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 at moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. 
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders,\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
 high-fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound pe
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 r\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
ceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the m
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 u\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
sic starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi-fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly
\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0  \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man.
\par \hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and he\hich\af0\dbch\af13\loch\f0 
aring are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this.
